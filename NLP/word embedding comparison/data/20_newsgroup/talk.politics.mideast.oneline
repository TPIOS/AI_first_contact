"knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies." source: stanford j. shaw, "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey," vol ii. cambridge university press, london, 1979, pp. 314-317.

the question is not which system would solve the me problem. why ? because any system can solve it. the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here (all palestine). i asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for all people involved. i assumed that was obvious, but i won't repeat that mistake. now that i have straightened that out, i'm eagerly awaiting your reply. joseph weitz (administrator responsible for jewish colonization) said it best when writing in his diary in 1940: 	 "between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both 	 peoples together in this country.... we shall not achieve our goal 						^^^ ^^^ 	 of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country. 	 the only solution is a palestine, at least western palestine (west of 	 the jordan river) without arabs.... and there is no other way than 	 to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to 	 transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 	 left.... only after this transfer will the country be able to 	 absorb the millions of our own brethren. there is no other way out." 				 davar, 29 september, 1967 				 ("courtesy" of marc afifi) just a question: if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information i'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older? i'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. guess what..? those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. ever. it's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get something back. "we" and "our" either refers to zionists or jews (i donot know which). well, i can give you an answer, you master of wisdom, i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem ! i think that is fair enough . no, that is _not_ an answer, since i asked for a system that could solve the problem. you said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction. guess where that takes your logic? to never-never land.

"painful search .." the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over nagorny karabakh. the figure is drawn from azeri investigators, hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians. the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku. later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief-stricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead. the state prosecuter, aydin rasulov, the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the "hojali disaster", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings. a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali. an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. this figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence. francois zen ruffinen, head of delegation of the international red cross in baku, said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from hojali, most of them civilians. "we did not count the bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy," mr zen ruffinen said. "we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead." mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre. "don't get worked up. it will take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 1990. those nationalists, the popular front, finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali, an azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians. officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department. "this is just a small percentage of the dead," said rafiq youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. "they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours." of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old. gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. exposure in the highland snows killed the last three. thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out, according to professor youssifov's report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said. files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here, six policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov, an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27 february. "there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500 in hojali, 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around nakhchivanik village," mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot. "people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return." there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces. the independent, london, 12/6/'92 heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers, torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago, writes hugh pope. "i'm still wearing the same clothes, i don't have any others," the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the hojali disaster. "i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to be alive." mr sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh. "at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy machine-guns, the lot," mr sadikov said. soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side. to escape, the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about 15 miles away. they thought they were going to make it, until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak. "none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by a car on the road, and the armenian outposts started opening fire," mr sadikov said. azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman son. seven of his immediate relations died, including his 67-year-old elder brother. "i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. "we have never got any of the bodies back." the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. one hero of the evacuation, alif hajief, was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing, mr sadikov said. another hero, elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali, said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam, there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee. "the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack. some people just kept going," mr sadikov said.

"knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies." serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union. all humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter, universal declaration of human rights, helsinki agreements, human problems international forums, documents signed by the soviet union - all of them are violated. the ussr's president, government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. the 140,000 strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan. as a result, a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. some 200,000 azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr, their historical homeland. together with them 64,000 russians and 22,000 kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in azerbaijan. some 40,000 turkish-meskhetians, lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists' destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr. we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled, its people are shot. there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media, armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states. one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan. it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh. hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr. we are for a united, indivisible, sovereign azerbaijan, we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic - muhammed emin rasulzade. but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 year reich' - the 'great armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent. but what about the lives of seven million human beings? if these people are muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? all people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion. our previous appeals were unheard. however, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. 		the committee for people's help to karabakh (of the) academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr > everyone knows this, even the turks know this, you know this. give > us a time period when the world is currently boring, and what is > happening in armenia would make front page headlines. think i'm lying? > take a look at what happened in somalia. when did the press report > it to the world? but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy. the armenians are christians, the azerbaijanis are moslems, and islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers. besides, at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan, a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred thousands of azeris. the paris-based 'association for democracy and human rights in azerbaijan' puts the number of khojali victims at 3,145. some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. this whole thing has now gone entirely too far. > want to know what will bring the story in armenia to the front > page?

"women and children have been scalped," said assad faradshev, an aide to nagorno-karabakh's azerbaijani governor. "when we began to pick up bodies, they began firing at us." the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam, rashid mamedov, said: "the bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep. even the fascists did nothing like this." truckloads of bodies near agdam on the outskirts of nagorno-karabakh, a reuters photographer, frederique lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with azerbaijani bodies. "in the first one i counted 35, and it looked as though there were as many in the second," she said.

the orders for the turkish extermination of the armenians #17 to the children of genocide: "send them away into the desert" this is part of a continuing series of articles containing official turkish wartime (ww1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders for the extermination of the armenian people in turkey. generally, these telegrams were issued by the turkish minister of the interior, talaat pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children: 	"to the government of aleppo. 	 november 5, 1915. we are informed that the little ones belonging to 	 the armenians from sivas, mamuret-ul-aziz, diarbekir and erzeroum 	 [hundreds of km distance from aleppo] are adopted by certain moslem 	 families and received as servants when they are left alone through 	 the death of their parents. we inform you that you are to collect 	 all such children in your province and send them to the places of 	 deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to 	 the people. 				minister of the interior, 						talaat" [1] 	"to the government of aleppo. 	 september 21, 1915. there is no need for an orphanage. it is not the 	 time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their 	 lives. send them away to the desert and inform us. 				minister of the interior, 						talaat" [2] 	"to the general committee for settling and deportees. 	 november 26, 1915. there were more than four hundred children in the 	 orphanage. they will be added to the caravans and sent to their 	 places of exile. 	 				abdullahad nuri. [3] 	"to the government of aleppo. 	 january 15, 1916. we hear that certain orphanages which have been 	 opened receive also the children of the armenians. whether this is 	 done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt 	 of it, the government will regard the feeding of such children or 	 any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it 	 purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as 	 detrimental. i recommend that such children shall not be received 	 into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish 	 special orphanages for them. 				minister of the interior, 						talaat." [4] 	"to the government of aleppo. 	 collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures 	 to which their parents have been subjected. send the rest away with 	 the caravans. 				minister of the interior, 						talaat" [5] 	"from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo. 	 at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows 	 of shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is 	 not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by 	 armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble 	 in the future. it is necessary that these children should be turned 	 out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of 	 deportation. those that have been kept till now are also to be sent 	 away, in compliance with our previous orders, to sivas. 				minister of the interior, 						talaat" [6] in 1926, halide edip (a pioneer turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with talaat pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" this ultra-national fascist anti-armenian mentality, the following: 	"i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for 	 its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks 	 it moral. i am ready to die for what i have done, and i know i 	 shall die for it." [7] these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of talaat pasha's, assassin, soghomon tehlerian. the turkish government never questioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians. for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s. orel and s. yuca of the turkish historical society. if one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it too would be a forgery!. in fact, if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persian/arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery. today, the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill, istanbul, turkey, just next to the yildiz university campus. the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww2 when turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism. recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-armenianism in turkey. this monument represents the epitome of the turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born armenian. 			- - - references - - - [1] _the memoirs of naim bey_, aram andonian, 1919, pages 59-60 [2] ibid, page 60 [3] ibid, page 60 [4] ibid, page 61 [5] ibid, page 61 [6] ibid, page 62 [7] _memoirs of halide edip_, halide edip, the century press, new york (and london), 1926, page 387 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992
deposition of vitaly nikolayevich danielian [1] born 1972 attended 9th grade middle school no. 17 resident at building 4/2, apartment 25 microdistrict no. 3 sumgait [azerbaijan] really, people in town didn't know what was happening on february 27. i came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to baku. when we left, everything in town was fine. life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and i. we spent the day in baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that i'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day. when we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus. the driver says that there are no armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no armenians on board. the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. we get off the bus, but are not taken for armenians. we set out in the direction of home. at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from block 41 to the 8th microdistrict. these groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. people who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. then we decided to go home instead. near the 12-story high-rises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "death to the armenians" was written on the cars. when we came into the courtyard--we live in an l-shaped building--it was still quiet. we went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. we tried to call baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on wednesday, not to come. then there was a knock at the door. it was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. we went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the armenians deserve, because in stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from agdam had been raped. we didn't stay very long in the basement. we tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. papa watched and said things now and then. he said that there was a fire near building 5, probably a car on fire. then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived. the neighbors said that there weren't any armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. they appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, i later found out, a woman had been murdered. the woman who ran away naked died. yuri avakian was killed, too. when the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. we went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while. we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait, but there was no answer. we decided she had already left. we sat at home. the phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. i called him to the phone. it was jeykhun mamedov, from my father's work brigade. he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. to be quite honest, papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . . they came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the armenians were. they came into our place. we tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. one of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. he read the surname "danielian," turned the page, read "armenian," and that alone was enough to doom us. he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." they had knives and steel truncheons. i had a knife in my hand. unfortunately, i didn't use it. i just knew that if i didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano. then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. one person was giving orders. when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; i let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. when he tried to push me, i hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; i realized that resistance was completely useless. we are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. the crowd surrounds us. at first they strike me, and i'm knocked out; when i come to, they beat me again . . . i lose consciousness often . . . i don't see or hear my parents, since i was the first one hit and was out cold. when i come to i try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. the crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. that's it. i try to pick them up, but can't. my left arm is broken. i start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. the bodies of my parents are still warm. we were attacked at around 9 o'clock. i regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . when i knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. i go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but i can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be ok. but they were still there. later, at 8 in the morning as i found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. if they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some "assistants." they call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital. there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. at 3 o'clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku. in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people, all of them armenians. the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians. the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th. then i was in the semashko hospital in baku. i was there 38 days. when i was released, on the 40th day, i found out that my parents were dead. at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated, but later i found out that they were dead. my father's older brother told me. my father's name was nikolai artemovich danielian. he was born in 1938. my mother, born in 1937, was seda osipovna danielian. papa worked at pmk-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator. they were also beaten on the head. the coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely. at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov, who had called. as it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. he knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. before the events i had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. i knew him by name. he denies that i was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. he denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. as i later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. he was about 20 years old. i don't know if he has since confessed or not. i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. one-hundred percent sure. my parents were from karabagh. father was from the village of badar, and was two years old when his family moved to baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. he was a student at the naval school, but never graduated. he went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev.] when he returned he lived in baku, and later moved to sumgait, helping with the town's construction. mamma was from the village of dagdagan, also from karabagh. she worked in sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site. my sister is older than i. she lives with her husband here in karabagh. i always loved my parents. that was why i went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that i would continue my studies. i finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school, and after that, the military school. but later i changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the naval school. i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life long--since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor. my father wanted it more than anything. he always recollected his youth, telling of the school, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it. now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here. i will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days. while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like ishkhan [trdatov]. he managed to hold them off [at their residence in microdistrict 3, building 6/2, apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. i also learned of uncle sasha, from building 5/2, whose daughter was raped . . . besides them, valery--i forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than i, he went to school no. 14. he was riding with his parents in the car. people were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. we even came to be friends. before that we had just seen each other around town. but in the hospital we got to know one another better. i learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . . today suren harutunian, the first secretary of the communist party of armenia, was shown on television. to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic. i was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the baku announcer who read the decision of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia. after the events in sumgait and those in baku, the best solution is to give karabagh to armenia, return it to armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that. i arrived in karabagh on april 11. i felt very bad. i had constant headaches. after a while my strength returned. my older sister, suzanna, took me in. i think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due. you can't take away what is their due. my parents and i often spoke of nagorno karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia, we would move here for sure. we always said that the armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing nagorno karabagh from armenia--was wrong. sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. and in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies in the hands of our government. june 13,1988 stepanakert -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

in his neverending effort to make sure that we do not forget what a moron he is, brad hernlem has asked why israel rarely abides by un security council resolutions. perhaps the list below might answer the question. incident security council response ------------------------------------------------------------ 1. hindu-moslem clash in india, over 2,000 killed, 1990 none 2. gassing to death of over 8,000 kurds by none iraqi air force, 1988-89 3. saudi security forces slaughter none 400 pilgrims in mecca, 1987 4. killing by algerian army of 500 demonstrators, 1988 none 5. intrafada (arabs killing arabs) -- over 300 killed none 6. 30,000 civilians slaughtered by government none troops in hama, syria, 1982 7. killing of 5,000 palestinians by jordanian troops, none thousands expelled, sept., 1970 8. 87 moslems killed in egypt, 1981 none 9. 77 killed in egyption bread riots, 1977 none 10. 30 border and rocket attacks against israel by none the plo in 1989 alone 11. munich, 1972: 11 israeli athletes slaughtered none 12. ma'alot, 1974: children killed in plo attack none 13. israel coastal bus attack: 34 dead, 82 wounded none 14. syria kills 23,000 palestinians, 1976 none 15. lebanon: over 150,000 dead since 1975 none 16. yemen: 13,000 killed in two weeks, 1986 none 17. sudan: tens of thousands of black slaves, none civil war toll, 1 million killed, 3 million refugees 18. tienenman square massacre 1989 none 19. rumania, 3,000 killed, 1989 none 20. pan am 103 disaster carried out by the p.l.o none 21. northern ireland none 22. cambodia none 23. soviet occupation of afghanistan none 24. american riots at attica, watts, newark, kent state none 25. 1981: israel destroys iraqi reractor, israel condemned 26. 1990: israeli police protect israeli worshipers condemned against arab mob, 18 anti-jewish rioters killed 27. syrian soldiers slaughter christian soldiers none after they surrender, 1990 it appears that brad hernlem and the united nations security council have something in common. they both seem unfettered by the demands of acting on principle.
it is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.i recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.those who contest this statement present the figures of the world war ii.however we must keep in mind that it was a world war and no country had the power to stop it,today is the matter not of the power but of the will.it seems to be that what we lack is the will. second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event, today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.and this,i think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world. m.rizvi

from israeline 4/14 today's ma'ariv reports that yesterday, following egyptian president hosni mubarak's meeting with plo chief yasser arafat and prominent palestinian faisal al-husseini, the latter said that in principle, the palestinians have decided to participate in the peace talks. nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the arab foreign ministers in damascus. the newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the palestinian delegation to the peace talks. the threats, in arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to washington to, "sell out the palestinian people." one caller threatened, "should you go, you will not find your family alive upon your return." the newspaper states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at the houses of faisal al-husseini, hanan ashrawi and others. ---- naftaly stramer 			 | intergraph electronics internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com | 6101 lookout road, suite a voice: (303)581-2370 fax: (303)581-9972 | boulder, co 80301 "quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

[1] born 1964 secretary-typist azsantekmontazh trust sumgait construction and installation administration secretary of the smu komsomol organization resident at building 17/33b, apartment 15 microdistrict no. 3 sumgait [azerbaijan] on the 27th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the city party committee, about 50 yards away. the sk theater. they were showing an argentinian film, "the abyss." before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the city party committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. that is, we knew it was about karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. we bought our tickets. there were 30 or 40 people in the theater. this was a very small number for that large movie theater. the film started. about 30 minutes later they stopped the film. a crowd burst in. about 60 people. they came up onto the stage. well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage. they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to armenian girls. i thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. marina and i were sitting together. i told her to move over, there were some russian girls sitting nearby. so that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not marina. it got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats. everyone in the theater was looking at one another, russians, azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. but no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. they were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. some guy, a really fat one, says, "ok, we've scared them enough, let's leave." they leave slowly, pompously. it seemed to me that those people were not themselves. either they had smoked a bunch of "anasha", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. the film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. we could barely sit to the end. so it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . . marina and i were walking home, lenin street, that's the center of town. lenin street was packed, just packed with young people. they were shouting, something about karabagh and something about armenians. we weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? public transportation wasn't running. incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. everything was broken. he stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. well, since he looked more or less calm i decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. we went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. we didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. we flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. we told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. i said, well, ok . . . so we got into the cab and managed to get there. something incredible was happening at the bus station. there was a traffic jam. public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting "ka-ra-bagh," they're not going to give up karabagh. i go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. mamma says, what should we do? like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: nothing that bad could happen. where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? somehow we manage to calm mamma down. and we went to bed. but no one could sleep. everyone made as though nothing had happened. that was on saturday. in short, the day went by. we didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. no one did anything. because . . . life goes on. that day i realized something was approaching, but what exactly, i couldn't guess. on the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. there were five of us at home: mamma, papa and us, three sisters: lyuda, marina, and i. my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time. we sat at home and no one went out. later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. it all started . . . they were smashing up stores. we were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. then a girlfriend of mine, lyuda zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock i think. we worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a russian girl. she said that something awful was happening in town. i asked, "don't they want armenians? well what are they after, if they're already in that state?" she says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. public transportation has been stopped . . . the cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare. then papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . he left the house and our neighbor, aunt vera, asked him, "where are you going? stop! there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?" papa didn't know what she was talking about. she simply pushed him back into the entryway. he came home and told mamma. mamma said, "well, if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on." but we didn't go see her, she's a russian, she lives across from us. i had to see my friend out. around five o'clock i tell lyuda, "ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, i'll see you out." mamma says, "you don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is." so we decided to stay home. dinner was ready. mamma says, "let her eat with us, then she can go." we sat down at the table. but no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. we turned on the television, and the show "in fairy-tale land" was coming on. we cleared the table. we hear some noise out in the courtyard. i go out on the balcony, but i can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. there is mob of people . . . i can't figure out what's happening. they're shouting something, looking somewhere, i can't make out what is going on. i go down to a neighbor, she's an azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. i go down to look from their place. i see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. the mob runs off in different directions. i even see several people from our building. they are looking and laughing . . . i decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . i become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . can't speak . . . well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . if each of them kicked him just once . . . they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. but it was far away and i couldn't see if he got up and left or not. i become terrified and go home and say, "lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . " then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. we go out onto the balcony. all of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. everyone is standing, staring. the mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. as it turns out, at the 12-story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. there's only one entryway there, they could stop them. they all run up to our building. mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. they have stones and they break the windows, all of them. there are very many people. we have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. they spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. they crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. it's just a huge cloud of people. they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian, from our building. we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. it's incomprehensible. mamma told me later that they were shouting father's name, "grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!," or something like that. i don't remember that, i was spaced out, kind of. mamma says, "into the bedroom, quickly!" in the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; mamma says, "hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave." she says, "we'll tell them that we live alone here." i can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . i go to them and say that i'll stand together with them, i'll talk with them if they come, maybe i can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: i speak azerbaijani more or less, and i can find out what they want. i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister lyuda, i can't remember if i told her anything or not. then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. the crows bursts in and starts to shout: get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia; things like that. i tell them, "what has happened, speak calmly. one of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened." in azerbaijani, they say, "get out of the apartment, leave." i say, "ok. go downstairs. we'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment." i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. they must be stopped. the ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, "there are old people and one girl with them. too bad!" they take two or three steps back. it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange. then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: "don't you understand what you are saying? kill them?" and that was it! that was all it took. they grab papa, carry him into one room, and mamma and me into another. they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. they start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of mamma. i don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. i had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, i don't even know what i said. the atrocities started. i was savagely raped in that room. they argued among themselves who would go first. later, i remember, i came to. i don't know if i'm dead or alive. someone comes in, someone tall, i think, clean-shaven, in an eskimo dogskin coat, balding. he looks around at what's happening. at that instant everything stops. it seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. he looks and says, "well, we're done here." they are beating mamma on the head. they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . she loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. papa . . . was out cold. they want to throw lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. they leave her next to the window. she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. she's not a real strong person anyway . . . he looks at me and sees that i'm saying something, that i'm still twitching. well, i start saying the opposite of what i should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. i start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. i already know that i'm dead, why would i humble myself before anyone? and he says that if that's what i think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing . . . in short, he commands that i be taken outside. i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda, i don't know if they are alive or not. they take me outside. they are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. they are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . while they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .i don't even know. i think, my god, when will death come? if only it were sooner . . . then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. i lose consciousness . . . what happened after that, how many people there were, i don't remember. i come to after a while, i don't remember how long. a neighbor is bringing me clothing. i'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. i remember that i said the same words over and over again: "mamma, what happened, mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?" i can't make sense out of anything. there is a guy standing over me, i sort of know him, he served in afghanistan, his name is igor, he brought me indoors. when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. igor agayev is azerbaijani; he served in afghanistan. there are three brothers. the older brother also served there, i think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in armenia. igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, "karina, i know you, calm down, i'm not one of them." how do i know who's who and what's what? i come to, and they clean me up. i was covered in blood. then papa . . . i saw papa, i saw mamma. and marina, too . . . igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed . . . marina . . . lyuda said that she was russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the russians, go. and while they are dragging marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's azerbaijani. igor immediately grabs marina's and lyuda's hands, because he knows marina, and knows that she is armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. she opens the door and igor pushes them in there. so they survived. my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. while they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. the neighbor opened and said, "i'm not going to let you in the apartment because i'm afraid of them. but i'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building." lyuda says, "i'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs." it was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . i came to. mother was there. i can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. somehow i remembered and called, and he came to get us. he didn't have any idea what was going on. he thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. he came and got us and took us to the police precinct. there they looked us over. i was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . . my supervisor's name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov. he's the head of our administration. they took us there. when we were leaving, i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. the buses were ordinary passenger buses. there were very many soldiers. we left around eleven, right after eleven. if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . i think everyone know not only in sumgait, not only in yerevan. because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. after us. i think 14 people died in microdistrict no. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from buildings 4, 5, and 6. in our building one person died, and one old woman died from building 16, that's the building in front of ours. there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. i called a aunt in microdistrict no. 5. they have three neighbors who are armenians. i said, "run quickly, i can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. hide at azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away." at that moment three people came in, policemen. i think they were azerbaijanis. i was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. no one would have thought that i would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. i started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? one of the soldiers said, "don't scream at us. we're muslims, but we're not from the sumgait police. they called in from daghestan." so at that point the daghestan police were there. when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . i don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. i don't know what they were there for. there were also doctors from baku there. they examined lyuda and me and said, "these women need to go to the maternity home, but we don't know what to do with the rest." so they took us, and i lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. my boss said, "don't worry, i'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens." we went to the hospital. there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home, pashayeva, i think her name was. she examined us. the ambulance was from baku; i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. i even thought to myself, "god, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?" she looks me over and says, "now why are you suffering so? you don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things." and i think, great, i have to deal with her . . . and i felt so bad, i thought, why don't i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. i just didn't have the energy to say, "how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?" i stayed there. then they brought in another woman, ira b., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. there were three of us, ira, lyuda, and 1. the next morning they took lyuda and ira away. they didn't do anything to help us. this was in the old maternity home, in the combined block. they didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. i didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. what shots could have calmed me down? i didn't even want to look at them. i lay in the ward. either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but i was alone. i was alone even though the wards were packed. that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. she asked what had happened to me, and i said, "better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened." she fell into a faint. all the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because i was literally naked. the only thing i had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, "i can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?" i went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. people from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, i think, three or four pounds, but i couldn't take them. i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. i said that i couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. no one had to bring me anything. some woman took the sack . . . and, oh yes! . . . then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. that it would be worse. or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, i don't know. in any case, i didn't sleep a wink that night. the next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. i didn't even know where they were taking me. they took me to the club where the troops were, the very one i was in that ill-fated evening. i got off the bus. near the city party committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. i saw a few people i knew there, and that calmed me a little. i had already thought that i was the only one left. so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night. i still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. i didn't know whether to believe him or not. maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew. they all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, "what happened, what went on?" two days later they came to see me from work. they were there all the time. each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. they did everything they could. of course i'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. he constantly took an interest. a sincere interest, from the heart . . . then, about two days later, the secretary of the party committee came, not from our party organization, but from the first trust, which ours is part of, comrade kerimov, a very important figure in our town. he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if i sat down by myself i couldn't get up or lie down again. there was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. they examined me there several times, there i lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, i don't know. they didn't diagnose anything in particular. when i was in the maternity home i even asked . . . i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful. there was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. the mother of one of marina's friends was there. she was the head doctor at the sumgait children's clinic. they had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what i needed at that moment, i thought. i said that i was having great difficulty breathing, i couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. they put tight bandages around my chest and waist. later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over. i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . but i wasn't cut. they took us to the khimik boarding house. we lived there a long time. soon appeared representatives . . . they were agitating. at first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. one of the armenian women shouted, "we demand that seidov come!" the response was, "it's seidov who sent us." seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers. the woman said, "we'll only see seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators." and so on. more of them said, "have seidov himself come." this went on day in, day out. the agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. everything got on our nerves: the smell, the small children. there were children at the sk club, children who had literally just come out of the maternity home. what were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? at first we had to pay to eat there. they even overcharged us, as it turned out. on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. the children were ill. everything stank there. well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. you couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. the stench was awful. even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan, the infants. they have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. people were fainting right and left. i just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. but the women were in a constant state of panic. it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single armenian left. then people went up to the attic. i didn't see them, i only heard them, because i was lying down and couldn't get up. i lay right on the stage, we had some room there. apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. i think they wanted to burn the theater. maybe someone saw them, i didn't. i was in no condition to open my eyes. everyone was suspicious of everyone else. they would ask, "aren't you an azerbaijani? i think i saw you somewhere, i think you're an azerbaijani." they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. half of the people did not have any documents. there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their ids. so on the 28th, on sunday, i think, the police did nothing to help us. on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block 41a. they didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. they killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew, my mother worked with them. their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. they were brutally murdered. only the two daughters-in-law survived. by a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. she was pregnant and had two small children. this all continued on monday in block 41a, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city. they murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. they say they didn't even know for sure if the people were armenians or not. i heard that the lezgins suffered, too. i'm not sure myself, i didn't see any lezgins who had been injured. they burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. it was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the btz plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, aunt razmella, who also lived in microdistrict 3. they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait. in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait, and people from baku were going home from sumgait, and there were students, too. they were simply savagely murdered. they were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. they stopped the buses, dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot. i didn't see it myself, but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, ira g., if i'm not mistaken. she was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. i still can't imagine how he managed to do that. i heard that from engels grigorian. he knows her, apparently. well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, i think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. they couldn't find the guy who saved her. he left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face. i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe i had talked with him once. but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. i can't remember to this day who he was. then, it seems, i saw the secretary of the directorate's party organization, where marina works. she goes to school and works, she goes to night school at azi, and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration. i'm the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations. we had joint meetings. i know them all, i've even talked with them, and he, i know, is from armenia. an azerbaijani, but from armenia. it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia. they took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the procuracy, because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case, and i iden- tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize. they showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but i can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. all these people, all of them, as much as i've heard about them and seen them, they were all from kafan. the secretary of the party organization is named najaf, najaf rzayev. he was there when everything started. it must have been him because i didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him. all the more since i told him, "listen, you do something, because you know me." he turned away and went toward the bedroom, where marina was. well you couldn't see marina anyway. there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. all of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually i became myself again, at the city party committee . . . there were military people there. i told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. i told them his name. on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is najaf rzayev. i tell mamma, "if he's here despite the fact that i gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think i'm crazy, not responsible for my words." he said, "what did they do to you, how awful, myself, i hid an armenian family." then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: "i wasn't at home, my family and i went to baku." i said, "marina, what is he saying? he said something totally different before." after that i didn't go to see our procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh, fedorov by name. fedorov told me that rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. what are they doing with rzayev? did he prove his alibi or not? they just think that since i was hit in the head i can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same time i'm afraid to say i'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. because no mat- ter who i name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. who did what exactly i can't say. when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but i didn't see it, because i had my eyes closed all the time. it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out. so i had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. a young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the btz plant. and right nearby, across the road from us, block 41, is where all this was going on. right across the road from us. the btz dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as i know, that it was he who killed shurik gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. one person in our building was killed, it was that man. a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. a while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. that guy went and told them everything. now they've caught him, everything's been proved. now, evidently, they've been beating him, i don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. some young guy came to the plant and said, "everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten." that was it. he said, the ones who wanted to, went. this was at the btz plant, during the night shift, probably, late friday night. it was at night, they were at the sauna together. and he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? the others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, i'm going to go. but they didn't say anything to one another. he said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan, that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. that guy was also born in kafan. that is certain. and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia, too. from i've participated in the investigation a couple of times. i'm satisfied with them thus far. they summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word i said was recorded. i met some guy there . . . by the way, he was an armenian. i said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, i don't know. his last name was grigorian, eduard grigorian. he s from sumgait, from microdistrict 1. he was sentenced i think, to five years, not his first time. his mother is russian. i met with him at the kgb in baku, at the azerbaijani kgb. they took us there and showed me photographs. there were so many photographs, i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and i've got them all confused. i say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. well. this guy, grigorian, i said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a lezgin. i don't know what he did, i can't remember. maybe he beat me or raped me. but he was in our apartment. at the kgb he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. i took a look at him and thought, "my god, heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you." but they were satisfied with my responses, because i said everything without great certainty. i was there with mamma. then lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. she wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. she recognized him. when she came to, lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. they stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything. well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . two people were saying they could burn the apartment. another says, why burn the apartment when i've got three kids and no place to live. so this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from sumgait. they were sure that they would get the apartment. besides, the neighbors were azerbaijani. why should they burn the apartment, they might burn azerbaijanis. that's what they said. how did they know there were azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that armenians lived there? we have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? so they didn't set fire to our apartment. i don't know, i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, i would have said that a civil war was going on. well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. so a civil war was going on, and only the armenians were being fought. if it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. but they only fought us. then i met some women from our building, some azerbaijanis. they are crying, they tell me, "karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?" they're asking me! well i just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn't have been able to take it, or i would have tried to avert it, like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. a woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. two armenian families live there, in her part of the building. she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. she came down to the entryway and said, "you'll come in this entryway over my dead body." so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. i don't think that's true. they knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. they couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them. they were just beasts, they had smoked so much. when they came to our place they were all chewing something. i noticed: everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. i think, my god, maybe i just think that? maybe i'm losing my mind? but no, they're all chewing something. maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. but they were shouting something. they didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. they screamed and screamed: "yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the armenians!" only they didn't shout "kill," they shouted "gurun ermianlary." gurun literally means "kill," or "destroy." that's how it was! i'll continue. we hid in a captain's apartment, he's an azerbaijani, his wife is a tatar. we were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. their kids knew a whole lot. this was in our part of the building, on the third floor. when mamma came to and couldn't find lyuda she took papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. mamma found the courage to . . . a boy said to my mother "where's the gold?" mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. he even looked russian, he was so fair-skinned. but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair-skinned. i noticed they were all on the fair side. he shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks mamma where the gold is. we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. in a little black bag, we kept everything in there. mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. mamma thinks that the gold saved us. because they threw themselves at the gold, and mamma grabbed papa, who was trying to breathe. they had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . he had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, "what's happened?" he sees that they are bloody. mamma said, "at least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses." he went looking for us. at that moment lyuda was under the bed. she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. when he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. she wanted to get out and was calling softly. she thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. and again . . . she thought that she had lost her mind. i'll never leave here, never! to hell with it! it just seems that way to me, i'll come to eventually. but then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought lyuda down, and igor carried me in from outside. or first i was brought in, then lyuda, i don't remember what order it happened in. and mamma said, "listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building." it had more or less calmed down where we were. who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. i tried to call my girlfriend. i had basically come to. mamma says, "listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. we don't know how long we'll be here. maybe they didn't burn everything." i don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? i tell mamma, "mamma, what do you need any of that for? to hell with it! we're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!" she says, "no, let's go get at least something. maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's." mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son alik, was standing on the lookout. lie was standing there to see if they were coming. they only managed to run up there and grab something one time. he shouts, "come back, they're coming!" they didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . mamma got my knitting . . . someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . someone took father's old coveralls. the neighbor, his wife, mamma and papa . . . marina went with them. i was in no condition to leave. neither was lyuda. we just sat. they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. they were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . there was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. then things more or less calmed down. i tried to call my boss. later there was more noise. we were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, asya dallakian. she's an old woman, retired. she wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. she is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. they started pounding on her door and broke it down. she had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. when her grandson came she bought a television. they started wrecking everything. i started getting sick again. i think, "my god, what is going on around here? when will this end?" we turned off the lights and sat. as it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. we didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. they all knew very well that he was a captain. he went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. his last name was kasumov. he's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. he went out and stood at his door. they tell him, "comrade captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us." he went upstairs, and they say, "aren't you taking anything from this apartment?" he says, "i don't need anything." and the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. the women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. a guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, "where's the rug? i just put it right here!" they tell him, "some guy came and took it and went off toward the school." he ran off in that direction. oh! i forgot the most important point. when igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. they just didn't tell me about it for a long time. the wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, i was already dead enough. later she told me, that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, "where's the girl who was here?" and he became furious. the woman tells him, "she came to . . . " she didn't know what to say: think something up? someone carried her off? then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. so the woman says, "she came to and went to the basement." now, our basement is full of water. so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. they took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. they climbed down in there to get me. then one of them said, "there's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. she met her death in the basement. that's it, we can leave, no problem!" i didn't know that, and when i was told, i felt worse. two times worse. a lot worse! so they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . after that we of course didn't want to live in sumgait any longer. we really didn't want to go back to our apartment. when we moved, i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because i started remembering it all. although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . the people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. i think that they could have helped! i don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. that means they could have, too. it would have been enough foe one man or women to say, what do you think you're doing?" that's all! that would have done it. there were 60 apartments in our building. not one person said it! when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian. they would have stood up for one of their own. true, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. the azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. the old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, "if you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment." so she left. that trick didn't work on them. even the neighbors who helped us move told me, ok, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. i said i'd only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then i would forget everything, too. imagine that it happened to your sister. and no one did anything. anything. april 25, 1988 yerevan 			- - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 93-109 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

[it looks like yigal has been busy...] rtw 04/14 2155 jewish group sued for passing official information by adrian croft san francisco, april 14, reuter - nineteen people, including the son of former israeli defence minister moshe arens, sued the anti-defamation league (adl) on wednesday, accusing the jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them. richard hirschhaut, director of the san francisco branch of the adl, art dealer roy bullock and former policeman tom gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in san francisco county superior court. the 19 accuse the adl of b'nai b'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies. the suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of israel and south africa, in what it alleges was a "a massive spying operation." the action is a class-action suit. it was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the adl, bullock and gerard gathered information. representatives of the adl in san francisco were not immediately available for comment on wednesday. the civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that gerard, a former inspector in the san francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on california political activists to a spy ring. the fbi and san francisco police are investigating the adl, bullock and gerard over the affair and last week searched the adl's offices in san francisco and los angeles. the suit alleges invasion of privacy under the civil code of california, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources. it seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages. lawyer pete mccloskey, a former congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included arab-americans and jews -- and his wife helen, who also had information gathered about her. one of the plaintiffs is yigal arens, a research scientist at the university of southern california who is a son of the former israeli defence minister. arens told the san francisco examiner he had seen a file the adl kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of palestinians and his position on the israeli-occupied territories. according to court documents released last week, bullock and gerard both kept information on thousands of california political activists. in the documents, a police investigator said he believed the adl paid bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and bullock received confidential information from the authorities. no criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. the adl, bullock and gerard have all denied any wrongdoing. reuter ac kg cm apn 04/14 2202 adl lawsuit copyright, 1993. the associated press. all rights reserved. by catalina ortiz associated press writer san francisco (ap) -- arab-americans and critics of israel sued the anti-defamation league on wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network. the adl, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-semitism, intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to the class-action lawsuit filed in san francisco superior court. "none of us has been guilty of racism or nazism or anti-semitism or hate crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the adl claims to protect against. none of us is violent or criminal in any way," said carol el-shaieb, an education consultant who develops programs on arab culture. the 19 plaintiffs include yigal arens, son of former israel defense minister moshe arens. the younger arens, a research scientist at the university of southern california, said the adl kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized israel's treatment of palestinians. "the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american ... or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti-semite," arens said. the adl has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the adl's new york headquarters. the fbi and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the adl spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including white supremacist and anti-semitic organizations, arab-americans, greenpeace, the national association for the advancement of colored people and san francisco public television station kqed. some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit. no charges have been filed in the criminal investigation. the lawsuit accuses the adl of violating california's privacy law, which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information "not otherwise public" from state or federal records. the lawsuit claims the adl disclosed the information to "persons and entities" who had no compelling need to receive it. it didn't elaborate. defendants include richard hirschhaut, director of the adl's office in san francisco. he did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. other defendants are san francisco art dealer roy bullock, an alleged adl informant over the past four decades, and former police officer tom gerard. gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to bullock. gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the philippines. bullock's lawyer, richard breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it. upwe 04/14 1956 adl sued for allegedly spying on u.s. residents san francisco (upi) -- a group of california residents filed suit wednesday charging the anti-defamation league of b'nai brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments. the class-action suit, filed in san francisco superior court, charges the adl and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of israeli policies towards the occupied territories and south africa's apartheid policy. the adl refused to comment on the suit. the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san francicso police officer tom gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws. according to the suit, gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers. information from these files were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges. "the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant," said former rep. pete mccloskey, who is representing the plaintiffs. the adl's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorney's office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years. "my understanding is that they (the adl) consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate," said arens, a research scientist at the university of southern california. "the adl believes that anyone who is arab american...or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti-semite." the fbi and the district attorney's office have been investigating the operation for four months. the 19 plaintiffs in the case include arens, the son of former israeli defense minister moshe arens. in a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the adl of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech.

there have been a number of articles on the pbs frontline program about iranian bomb. here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects. one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about iran in recent months. these include: 1) attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center. despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this. they, however, have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter. 2) public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state. 3) and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program. i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify. why this increased pressure on iran? a number of factors may have been behind this. these include: 1) the rise of islamic movements in north-africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories. this movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily fueled by iran. the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom. also, the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth. a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems. 2) possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region. 3) a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures. this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union. the recent pr campaign against iran, however, seems to be directed from israel rather than washington. there is no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. this may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran . --jamshid

"the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. i am convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle. but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin [1] would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2]. "in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah, whom mr. ben gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' the 'wise ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal superciliousness. he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of 'dissidents.' throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about 'jewish attrocities.' "the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. in the result it helped us. panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel. kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. beit-iksa was also evacuated. these two places overlooked the main road; and their fall, together with the capture of kastel by the haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem. in the rest of the country, too, the arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with jewish forces. not what happened at dir yassin, but what was invented about dir yassin, helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. the legend of dir yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the conquest of haifa." [1] (a footnote from _the revolt_, pp.226-7.) "to counteract the loss of dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, arab headquarters at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by irgun troops of women and children in the village. certain jewish officials, fearing the irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun. an eminent rabbi was induced to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth. out of evil, however, good came. this arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arabs and arab troops, who were seized with panic at the mention of irgun soldiers. the legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of israel. the `dir yassin massacre' lie is still propagated by jew-haters all over the world." [2] in reference to denunciation of dir yassin by fellow jews.

david posts a good translation of a post by suat kinikliouglu: [most of the original post elided] [kk] ***** vatan sevgisi ruhlari kirden kurtaran en kuvvetli ruzgardir ***** in translation, as a public service: [most of the translation elided] ***** the love of the fatherland is the strongest of all winds cleansing filth off souls ***** i think this part of the translation is questionable. although i think the original quote is plain silly, you made it sound as if it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. for example, turks talk of a "motherland" not a germanic "fatherland". why "filth" instead of "dirt"? the indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem [1] so one may have to "fudge", but with some care of course. is the following an equally valid translation? the love of one's country is the strongest wind to cleanse one's soul. see my point? nevertheless, i think you translate well. oz --- [1] willard van orman quine word and object mit press, cambridge, mass 1960

"the armenians just shot and shot. and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives." " they were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed rasia aslanova, who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through armenian lines. she said her husband, kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. her daughter was still missing. one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off. the survivors said 2000 others, some of whom had fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. by late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial, two were children and three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range. agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. nor were they safe in agdam. on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150,000, destroying several buildings and killing one person. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

"knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies." source: stanford j. shaw, "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey," vol ii. cambridge university press, london, 1979, pp. 314-317.

"major principles of the constitution" the constitution (with 177 articles) establishes the structure of the republic within the following principles: - the turkish republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by law; - it should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice, human rights and the objectives of ataturk; - the language of the state is turkish; - sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions. sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - legislative power is carried by the parliament elected by the nation. this power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - executive power is exercised by the president, and council of ministers; - judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the turkish nation; - all individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color, sex, or political beliefs; - laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the constitution. "structure of the state" in accordance with the constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of "division of power" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. the power is divided into "legislative power," "executive power," and "judicial power," balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control). a. legislative power: the "turkish grand national assembly" is a parliament with one house, elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation. the basic functions of this assembly are: - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws; - to approve or to dismiss the council of ministers; - to supervise and to question ministers or the council of ministers; - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets; - to ratify international agreements; - to grant amnesty or pardons. members of parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral or written) during the course of their legislative duties. the country is divided into constituencies. the number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population. every turkish citizen over the age of twenty-one can vote. elections are supervised by the "supreme council of elections," which solves all disputes or appeals. in each province, the local "board of election" runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the supreme council. members of the council and boards are elected among independent judges. b. executive power: the president of the republic is the head of state (not the head of government as in the unites states). the main functions of the president are: - to represent the state and the country; - to insure the implementation of the constitution; - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions; - act as the supreme commander of the armed forces; - to ratify laws and government decrees. the president is elected by the grand national assembly for a period of seven years. the president may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may call for a referendum. executive power is exercised by the "council of ministers," headed by the prime minister. the prime minister is appointed by the president from the members of parliament. the prime minister names the ministers for approval by the president. the new government (council of ministers) reads their program at the parliament and the vote of confidence follows. there are 21 (?) ministers in the council. ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent "administrative" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or functions against any law. c. judicial power: judicial power is exercised by independent courts. no authority or power can instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. these cannot be discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. there are three categories of courts in the turkish judiciary system: - courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. the decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice upon the appeal of the parties involved. - the decisions or functions of the executive power (including the prime minister and ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law. the decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the high administrative court. the laws and decisions of the grand national assembly can be examined by the "constitutional court" if they contradict the constitution. if found contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the parliament. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

washington - a stark reminder of the holocaust--a speech by nazi ss leader heinrich himmler that refers to "the extermination of the jewish race"--went on display friday at the national archives. 	the documents, including handwritten notes by himmler, are among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the holocaust is a myth, archivists say. 	"the notes give them their authenticity," said robert wolfe, a supervisory archivist for captured german records. "he was supposed to destroy them. like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules." 	the documents, moved out of berlin to what himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by allied forces after world war ii from a salt mine near salzburg, austria. 	himmler spoke on oct.4, 1943, in posen, poland, to more than 100 german secret police generals. "i also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter. among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly. i mean the clearing out of the jew, the extermination of the jewish race. this is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written."

'after all, who remembers today the extermination of the tartars?'

(a copy of this agreement can be found in the 'congressional record,' november 1, 1945; see document 1.) on this side of the atlantic, nazi armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. they had often expressed pro-nazi sentiments until america entered the war. in summary, during world war ii armenians were carried away with the german might and cringing and fawning over the nazis. in that zeal, the armenian publication in germany, hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1] "sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it becomes necessary for a people (the nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. during the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." now for a brief view of the armenian genocide of the muslims and jews - extracts from a letter dated december 11, 1983, published in the san francisco chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one b. amarian. "...we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities against our people (jews)...members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near erzurum, turkey, by armenian neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish and/or muslim. armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... armenians were in league with hitler in the last war, on his premise to grant them self government if, in return, the armenians would help exterminate jews...armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-semitic acts in league with the russian communists. mr. amarian! i don't need your bias." signed elihu ben levi, vacaville, california.

"the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters," he affirmed. among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou, who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet; two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the christian democratic party, edik center party, two wings of the communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of greek towns and cities; two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens. more than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers, including the following: palestinian national revolutionary movement, fatah; popular front for the liberation of palestine-general command; the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movement-fatah; the socialist progressive party of lebanon; arab socialist labor party; the kurdistan democratic union of iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the israeli- palestinian conflict. support from arf-rm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federation-revolutionary movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to "reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are," to expose the anti-armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag "bureau." the message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement, open supporters of asala and armed struggle. the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital, known as neos kosmos, where there is a large armenian presence. the headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves... now any comment? #from: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (vedat dogan) #subject: re:addressing..... #message-id: <1993apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu> in article <1993apr7.225058.12073@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (david davidian) writes: >in article <1993apr7.030636.7473@news.columbia.edu> vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu >(vedat dogan) wrote in response to article <1993mar31.141308.28476@urartu. >11sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (david davidian) writes: > >[(*] source: "adventures in the near east, 1918-1922" by a. rawlinson, >[(*] jonathan cape, 30 bedford square, london, 1934 (first published 1923) >[(*] (287 pages). > >[dd] such a pile of garbage! first off, the above reference was first published >[dd] in 1924 not 1923, and has 353 pages not 287! second, upon checking page >[dd] 178, we are asked to believe: > >[vd] no, mr.davidian ... > >[vd] it was first published in 1923 (i have the book on my desk,now!) >[vd] ******** > >[vd] and furthermore,the book i have does not have 353 pages either, as you >[vd] claimed, mr.davidian..it has 377 pages..any question?.. > >well, it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the n>crap posted by mr.

it is appropriate to add what himmler said other "inferior races" and "human animals" in his speech at posen and elsewhere: from the speech of reichsfuehrer-ss himmler, before ss major-generals, posen, october 4 1943 ["nazi conspiracy and aggression", vol. iv, p. 559] ------------------------------------------------------------------- one basic principal must be the absolute rule for the ss man: we must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else. what happens to a russian, to a czech, does not interest me in the slightest. what the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. whether 10,000 russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for germany is finished. we shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. we germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. but it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. when someone comes to me and says, "i cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then i would have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, german soldiers will die, and they are the sons of german mothers. they are our own blood". extract from himmler's address to party comrades, september 7 1940 ["trials of wa criminals", vol. iv, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ if any pole has any sexual dealing with a german woman, and by this i mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. then the others will not do it. besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question. the women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. this we must do, unless these one million poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the german blood. philosophizing is of no avail in this case. it would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them. -danny keren.

i will try to answer some of dorin's questions, even though they were not addressed to me specifically, but i feel that i am a bit concerned by the thread since i am a southern lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of israel's bombs. in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder. it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder. this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. it seems to me, dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really is in south lebanon. in article <1993apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (dorin baru) writes: |> is there any israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?

i am not so sure. i am. i was back in my home village this last summer. for your information we are people, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists. most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee. is that so hard to imagine ???? it is not a "terrorist camp" as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... some young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the lebanese resistance. even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to. these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time. they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols. every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. once they are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist hideout" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. we are now accustomed to israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that "if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price". we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw. the people of south lebanon are occupied, or shelled by israel on a regular basis. we do not want to be occupied. if israel insists that the so called "security zone" is necessary for the protection of northern israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers. if israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from our land. we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border. i have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed. in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in. if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called "security zone" before the conclusion of the peace talks. such a move would save israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give israel a great moral lift, better israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions. along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it. there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances, and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon. |> if you ask me those questions, i will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : no, nobody is qualified candidate for murder, nothing |> justifies murder. i agree, only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder, no matter what you say. i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make |> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all israelis, jews, ?

so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again? while i also hope for this to happen, it will only occur when arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil. they have to prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way israel is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of tolerance towards "anti-israel guerillas in-residence". > >i have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only >real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace >settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and >peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure >no one on either side of the border is shelled. good lord, brad. what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything? they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in. it can ask them to leave *at any time*; as nasser did in '56 and '67. somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" i don't think that israel is going to be any more comfortable. without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the un is worthless to israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?). >this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to >realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting >its northern cities has failed. in fact it has caused much more >israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel >would have resulted in. perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that "many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate." if,however, you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties, i suggest you apply the same to palestinian, arab and islamic groups. >if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw >unilaterally from the so-called "security zone" before the conclusion >of the peace talks. such a move would save israeli lives, >advance peace efforts, give israel a great moral lift, better israel's >public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations >since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in >peace and has already offered some important concessions. >along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah >be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not >accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a >shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone >and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it. from israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it nothing...except the realization that it has given "something" up and now *can only hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from. israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon. the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by "private groups", 3) israel would prepare for the next round of attacks. what would israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations of present-day arab states)? >there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese >goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such >circumstances, > ah, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel? now, don't talk about vague "political factors" but about those "tangible" (just like that which israel gave up) factors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. your assessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing. >and now the lebanese government has proven that it is >capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did >in all other parts of lebanon. > >basil it has not. without the support, and active involvement, of syria, lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control?

[snip] imagine ???? it is not a "terrorist camp" as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... i would not argue that all or even most of the villages are "terrorist camps". there are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion. some young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the lebanese resistance. even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to. these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time. they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols. every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians. once they are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist hideout" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe. not all are. there are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes. hizbollah and amal were two of the larger ones and may still be. as to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties. israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw. well, here we disagree. i think that israel would willingly withdraw if the lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks. this is the only realistic solution, it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed. in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in. actually that is not clear at all. i will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though. there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances, and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon. no, the syrian gov't is more than happy to have israel sink into another lebanese morass. i could elaborate if necessary. i agree, only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder, no matter what you say. no, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation. -- shai guday | stealth bombers, os software engineer | thinking machines corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies. cambridge, ma |

(...) it is evident that the effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which, for more than two centuries, was to be oriented toward muslim east.>> page 21: <<in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city. he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century. sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews, prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate. this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*) page 41: <<...the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe. confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslim-jewish cooperation. certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered ''turks and jews,'' their sworn enemies, and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans. there are well-known examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers. the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda, in the early sixteenth century, and of rhodes. we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios. an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns...>> page 43: <<it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently, and all parties involved, jews, muslims, and christians, were aware of the situation.>> page 46: <<...it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial. the two groups had little in common, few common interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was that between muslims and jews, neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox.>> page 46: <<the general impression of muslim-jewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests. from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains.>> page 151: <<from the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the ottoman-jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the ottomans, in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines, and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests...>> page 161: <<it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century. that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted. it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews. it is, however, unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the non-jewish society in which they lived. we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did. certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>> (*) a version of rabbi sarfati's [tzarfati] letter is given by prof.shaw: page 32: <<your cries and sobs reached us. we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german lands....i hear the lamentation of my brethren...the barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...the priests and prelates of rome have risen. they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel. they always devise new persecutions. they wish to bring you to the stake...listen my brethren, to the counsel i will give you. i too was born in germany and studied torah with the german rabbis. i was driven out of my native country and came to the turkish land, which is blessed by god and filled with all good things. here i found rest and happiness; turkey can also become for you the land of peace...if you who live in germany knew even a tenth of what god has blessed us with in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out to come to us...here in the land of the turks we have nothing to complain of. we possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. we are not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered. rich are the fruits of the earth. everything is cheap, and every one of us lives in peace and freedom. here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in germany, where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold. arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect your forces, and come to us. here you will

"on the night of the 24th of december, 1963 my wife feride hasan and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr. nihat ilhan. our neighbours mrs. ayshe of mora, her daughter ishin and mrs. ayshe's sister novber were also with us. we were all sitting having supper. all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river direction started to riddle the house, sounding like heavy rain. thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was dangerous, we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer. altogether we were nine persons. we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet. we waited in fear. mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children murat, kutsi and hakan in her arms. suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open. greeks had come in and were combing, every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets. during these moments i heard voices saying, in greek, "you want taksim eh!" and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. mrs. ilhan and her three children fell into the bath. they were shot. at this moment the greeks, who broke into the bathroom, emptied their guns on us again. i heard one of the major's children moan, then i fainted. when i came to myself 2 or 3 hours later, i saw mrs. ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath. i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded. but what had happened to my wife? then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet, where, in the doorway, i saw her body. she was brutally murdered. in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying "help, help. is there no one to save us?" i became terrified. i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me. so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. an our passed by. in the distance i could still hear shots. my mouth was dry, so i came out from under the bed and drank some water. then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago. there i offered sweets to mrs. ayshe, her daughter and mrs. novber who were all wounded. we waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning. i thought morning would never come. we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital. finally, as we could walk, mrs. novber and i, went out into the street hoping to find help, and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik. there, we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on. when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs. ayshe and her daughter. after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment. there i have had four months treatment but still i cannot use my arm. on my return to cyprus, greeks arrested me at the airport. all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my detention. they then released me." on foot into cyprus's devastated turkish quarter we went tonight into the sealed-off turkish quarter of nicosia in which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five days. we were the first western reporters there, and we saw some terrible sights. in the kumsal quarter at no. 2, irfan bey sokagi, we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass. a child's bicycle lay in a corner. in the bathroom, looking like a group of waxworks, were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head. this, we were told, was the home of a turkish army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. today was five days later, and still they lay there. rene maccoll and daniel mcgeachie, (from the "daily express") "...i saw in a bathroom the bodies of a mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a turkish officer..." max clos, le figaro 25-26 january, 1964 peter moorhead reporting from the village of skyloura, cyprus. date : 1 january, 1964. il giarno (italy) they are turk-hunting, they want to exterminate them. discussions start in london; in cyprus terror continues. right now we are witnessing the exodus of turks from the villages. thousands of people abandoning homes, land, herds; greek cypriot terrorism is relentless. this time, the rhetoric of the hellenes and the bust of plato do not suffice to cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors. article by giorgo bocca, correspondent of il giorno date: 14 january 1964 daily herald (london) an appalling sight and when i came across the turkish homes they were an appalling sight. apart from the walls, they just did not exist. i doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. i counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. under red tile roofs which had caved in, i found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes. in the neighbouring village of ayios vassilios, a mile away, i counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. they were all turkish cypriot homes. from this village more than 100 turkish cypriots had also vanished.in neither village did i find a scrap of damage to any greek cypriot house. daily telegraph (london) graves of 12 shot turkish cypriots found in cyprus village silent crowds gathered tonight outside the red crescent hospital in the turkish sector of nicosia, as the bodies of 9 turkish cypriots found crudely buried outside the village of ayios vassilios, 13 miles away, were brought to the hospital under the escort of the parachute regiment. three more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could not be removed. turkish cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

4/15/93 1242 turkey sends light weapons as aid to azerbaijan by seva ulman ankara, turkey (upi) -- turkey is arming azerbaijan with light weapons to help it fight armenian forces in the struggle for the nagorno- karabakh enclave, the newspaper hurriyet said thursday. deputy prime minister erdal inonu told reporters in ankara that turkey was responding positively to a request from azerbaijan for assistance. "we are giving a positive response to all requests" from azerbaijan, "within the limits of our capabilities," he said. foreign ministry spokesman vural valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework of the council for security and cooperation in europe. hurriyet, published in istanbul, said turkey was sending light weapons to azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition. ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to turkey last week by a high-ranking azerbaijani official. turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in azerbaijan. wednesday, inonu told reporters ankara would not allow azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the armenians. "we feel ourselves bound to help azerbaijan, but i am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future," he said. he said turkish aid to azerbaijan was continuing, "and the whole world knows about it." prime minister suleyman demirel reiterated that turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement, he said. there was no immediate reaction in ankara to regional reports, based on armenian sources in yerevan, saying turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters. the newspaper cumhuriyet said turkish troops were digging in along the border with armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. no military action has occurred, the sources said. the latest upsurge in fighting between the armenians and azerbaijanis flared early this month when armenian forces seized the town of kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside fizuli, near the iranian border. -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence. israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ tim: there seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. the first is that of israel, where there is little trust for arab groups, so there is little support for israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. the second is that of the arab world/palestinians, where there is the demand that these "tangible concessions" be made by israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back. given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. by "tangible" is meant something that 1) provides israel with "comparable" protection (from the land it is to give up), 2) in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine **will be** accountable and held actively (not just "diplomatically) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens or "visitors"). in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory. 	aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above, 	how *could* such "guarantees" be instilled? for example, 	how could such "guarantees"/"controls" be added to the 	palestinian pisga proposals? israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to arab states, no more "buffer zone", gives full autonomy to palestinians), any and/or all of the arab parties could (and *would*, if not "controlled" somehow) easily return to the traditional anti-israel position. the question then is how to *really* ensure that that will not happen. tim

04/19/1993 0000 lezghis astir by nejla sammakia associated press writer gussar, azerbaijan (ap) -- the 600,000 lezghis of azerbaijan and russia have begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner of the caucasus. the region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring nagorno-karabakh, abkhazia and ossetia, but lezhgis could become the next minority in the former soviet union to fight for independence. lezghis, who are muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with armenia. they also want to unite the lezghi regions of azerbaijan and russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the soviet union created national borders that had been only lines on a map. a rally of more than 3,000 lezghis in march to protest conscription and demand a separate "lezghistan" alarmed the azerbaijani government. officials in baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. but the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with russian authorities to control the movement of lezhgis living across the border in the dagestan region of russia. visitors to gussar, the center of lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air. at the sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the russian border to a war they say is not theirs. "i have been drafted, but i won't go," said shamil kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. "why must i fight a war for the azerbaijanis? i have nothing to do with armenia." more than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of nagorno-karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast. malik kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served. "the police don't force people to go," he said. "they are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by lezghis in dagestan." all the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about. some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the gussar region, where 75,000 lezghis live. others said the rally was ordered by gen. muhieddin kahramanov, leader of the lezhgi underground separatist movement, sadval, based in dagestan. "we organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders," said kerim babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to sadval. "we hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the azerbaijanis, the russians." in the early 18th century, the lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now azerbaijan and dagestan. they roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates. by 1812, the lezghi areas were joined to czarist russia. after 1917, they came under soviet rule. with the disintegration of the soviet union, the 600,000 lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders. about half remained in dagestan and half in newly independent azerbaijan. "we have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine," complained mais talibov, a small trader. his goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from dagestan. "we want our own country," he said.

first this man promotes the dissolution of the jews through an intermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch of 'fundamentalist' jews who will object. this clown even called for 'buying' the dissolution of the jewish people. does this idiot mean to suggest that any jew who objects to an imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist? or does he simply mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?' i am not orthodox. i am not fundamentalist. i would desire a genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead davidsson can ever understand. but when he shows his willingness to dismiss an entire culture, he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in this newsgroup. please take your hatred for the essence of judaism and shove it up your ass. remember to pull your head out first.

how exactly did they do this? the story takes place over a number of years. the book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the holocaust. when the nazis came to power in germany in 1933, they immediately started dismissing jews and anti-nazi germans from universities, hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities, and it saw in these jews, who were being fired from their positions in germany, a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities. within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews, turkey arranged to take many of them in. they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities, as heads of scientific institutes, and as medical personnel in hospitals. about 300 to 500 major jewish professors came to turkey in the 1930s. ernst reuter, a german political scientist, spent the war years teaching political science in turkey. after world war ii, he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift. fritz neimark, a major german jewish economist, came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul. a man named reichenbach, who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey, eventually came to ucla, where he became a professor of philosophy. other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey. one such was karl ebert, who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis. he went to turkey, where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara, with the help of paul hindemuth. so the first section of the book covers this first phase, when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey. oddly enough, the german emigres, when they were in turkey, did not seem to think too badly of germany. they regarded themselves more as germans than jews, and they did not join in the anti-nazi activities of the local turkish jewish community. i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture. even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks, they shared the nazis' feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks. the second part of the book deals with the holocaust, which began in 1940 when the nazis occupied france. in europe at that time, and especially in france, there were about 20,000 turkish jews. they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i, when greece was threatening to overrun turkey. the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey. many jews fled to france during the 1920s and 1930s. many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens. suddenly the nazis invaded france in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-jewish laws. the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew, but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew. - how so? turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii. it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of 1944. during the war, therefore, turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against anti-jewish measures, and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book. turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis. for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship, there was generally no problem. if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp, the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect: "these people are turkish citizens. you can't do this to them." and the turkish jews would be released. if their businesses were confiscated, the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored. the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey. they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east, and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey. in order to keep turkish friendship, they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews. the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews. at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris, and that's where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place. the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens. the consuls couldn't declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not. my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate, either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship. this was a bureaucratic matter, so processing the application would take some time. in the meantime it was a real emergency, because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing. the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments, because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews. to take care of these former turkish jews, the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash, or "irregular fellow citizen." the document said in effect "this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship. in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen." the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it. since the nazis could not read turkish, on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship. by this means, the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship. actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews. on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey, was in favor of accepting these interventions. on the other hand, himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated. at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything. - do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued? there were about 20,000 turkish jews in europe before world war ii, about 10,000 of whom were living in france. most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france. i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply. generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens, and promise to send them out of france, the nazis would release them from the concentration camp. the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazi-occupied territory back to turkey. these trains ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory, but the trains were often held up by the nazi-influenced governments of eastern europe - croatia, serbia, and bulgaria - because these governments really didn't want the jews to escape. as a result of the turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the turkish jews in france were saved. another 3,000 were sent off to auschwitz, where most of them died. the remaining 3,000 either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians, who treated jews much better than the nazis did. at the end of 1943, however, italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those jews as well. incidentally, the turkish diplomats in nazi-occupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country. - the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution. yes, and there is an aside i might add here: in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews, the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey. on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews. the nazis claimed (and the vichy government agreed) that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally. turkey protested, saying, "you are dividing our citizens according to religion, but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally, regardless of religion. therefore, you cannot single out turkish jews." american consuls in paris, by contrast, accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldn't do anything about it, because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews. the third part of the book takes place in turkey, which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews. the kwish agency, an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine, set up an office in istanbul in 1940 under the leadership of chaim barlas. other jewish organizations in palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters. these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening. today we know about the holocaust, but at that time people didn't know what was going on. they didn't imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing. and so the first step was to get information, and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe. the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies. later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters, the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio, angelo roncali, who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from 1935 to 1944 and later became pope john xxiii. as the vatican representative during the war, he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe. with the cooperation of the turkish government, these agencies then sent hard currency, food, clothing, and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia, bulgaria, romania, and hungary. they weren't able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews. whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul, or by boat through the black sea to istanbul. turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war, because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing. the government, therefore, facilitated the movement of the non-turkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine, either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine, or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine. these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis, but also by the british, who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs. the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back. in a few cases the turkish government, yielding to british pressure, did send the boats back. for example, in one incident, the steamship struma, with some 700 jewish refugees from romania, was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador. when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine, all were lost except one person. nevertheless, all told, the turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war. the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money, and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country. - many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel. yes, and their children. but let's return for a moment to the first group, the turkish jews who came from europe. they did not go on to palestine; they stayed in turkey. it was the non-turkish, eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine. their story is very interesting. - and you have rescued it from obscurity. many studies have been made of the holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews. most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the nazis. my study deals with a much smaller number of people. i have tried to round out the picture, and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews. when it comes to numbers, the german jews were also relatively small in number. most of the millions slain were polish jews. the rescue of 100,000 eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of 6 million who were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved. about three-fourths of the book consists of documents - translations of many documents. they are included because the story is not well known. not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats; even the people of turkey did not know the story. i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents. - what languages are used in the documents? most of them are in turkish or french; some are in hebrew. there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine, the passengers, and so on, but i did not go into those details extensively. i describe mostly what turkey did, so most of my documents are in turkish or french. a few documents are in english. the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews; in fact, they often fought with one another. they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups. for example, some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews. finally, in 1944, president roosevelt sent a personal representative, ira hirschman, who had been an executive of bloomingdale's department store in new york city, and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences. the documents related to his mission are in english. i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld, a holocaust historian in france, who mainly worked on the french jews. (his father was killed by the nazis.) he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews, so i didn't personally consult the german archives. i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives, and i hope someone someday will make the effort. - this new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it? right. i'm giving a course on the history of the jews of the ottoman empire. i first gave the course two years ago. in addition to research, writing, and teaching, i've been actively involved in the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the coming of the jews to the ottoman empire. among other things, i helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in istanbul in 1992. - now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next? i'm working on two new books. one is a history of the turkish war for independence, which took place after world war i, during the years 1918 to 1923. the turks warded off the efforts of the victorious european powers to occupy turkey and end its independence. the second book is a study of sultan abdul hamid ii, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. he was an important modernizer in his own way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements. stanford j. shaw received a b.a. in history and an m.a. in british history. he then shifted to near eastern history, earning a second m.a. and a ph.d. at princeton. as a doctoral candidate at princeton, he spent two years abroad, studying at the school of oriental and african studies, university of london; the university of cairo, the american university at cairo, and the university of istanbul. he taught at harvard before coming to ucla in 1966. his postdoctoral research has been supported by the john simon guggenheim foundation, the american research institute in turkey, the social science research council, the national endowment for the humanities, the fulbright program, and isop. he has received honorary degrees from harvard university and bosporus university, bebek, istanbul, turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions to the fields of islamic and turkish studies from the center for research in islamic history, art, and culture in istanbul and from the american friends of turkey in washington, d.c. in addition to undertaking many professional service activities and public lectures in both the united states and turkey, shaw has also produced eight books and one edited volume. his history of the ottoman empire and modem turkey (2 vols.) has been published in many editions (six editions or reprints from 1977-1991), and translated into turkish (1983, 1991) and french (1984). his book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic (macmillan, london, and new york university press, 1992) will be published in turkish translation by the turkish historical society, istanbul. his turkey and the holocaust: turkey's role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution, 1933-1945 will be published by macmillan publishers, london, and new york university press in 1993. a pamphlet summarizing the book was published in ankara, turkey, in 1992. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

azerbaijan's government appealed to azeris all over the world in connection with escalation of the armenian aggression against the republic. it is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . the war against azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of the armenians of ukhari (upper) garabag, has meant the destruction of azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. this is all the price of fighting for liberty from russian imperial rule, is said in the document. azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state. it is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to

villages of the region of kelbajar went on within the last twenty-four hours. evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the armenian side and existence of fog. measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people. several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of kelbajar via mountain range. refugees are settled in the neighboring regions of azerbaijan and in ganja. authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical aid and food. the number of refugees from kelbajar is over

april) turan: fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on april 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of azerbaijan, arif aliev, today. journalists were also informed at the press-conference that international red cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. there is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid. arif aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of armenia, the leadership of azerbaijan intends to appeal to azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help. concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression of armenia, aliev said the department of state of the usa has expressed its anxiety to leadership of armenia. participants of peace efforts in daglig (nagorno) garabag under csce, rafaelli, mareska and chetin strongly blamed the aggression of armenia against azerbaijan.

kelbajar of azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0-- azerbaijanis picket in front of ministry of foreign affairs of russia baku (5 april) turan: azerbaijanis, living in moscow, picketed in front of the building of the ministry of foreign affairs of russia. picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of russian units in capture of the region of kelbajar of azerbaijan by armenians. about 100 people took part in the picket, organized by azerbaijani society "dayag".--0-- picket of sadvalers in moscow baku (5 april) 30-40 members of "sadval" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of azerbaijan in moscow. picketers were demanding the return of lezghins lands, as if annexed by azerbaijan. ambassador of azerbaijan in moscow, hikmet haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in azerbaijan. he marked in his talk with the turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the armenian aggression in the region of kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the "sadval" society in moscow. he also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the lezghian nationality in the whole. society of lezghins, "sadval", registered in moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of azerbaijan.--0-- attack of armenian units stopped baku (5 april) turan: attack of armenian army on the town of fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs the press-service of the ministry of defence of azerbaijan. in the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of the attackers were destroyed. advance units of the armenian army retreated several kilometers. chairman of the parliament, isa gambar, visited the town of fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0-- statement of ministry of foreign affairs of azerbaijan baku (5 april) turan: ministry of foreign affairs of azerbaijan issued a statement in connection with aggression of armenia in the region of kelbajar of azerbaijan. it is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of armenia captured the town of kelbajar on april 3 . attack of armenian units, which began on march 27 deep in the territory of azerbaijan still continues. armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of azerbaijan. spreading of armenian aggression far away from ukhari (upper) garabag proves that the armenian-azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. this is the result of non-recognition of armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document. it is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th russian army are participating in the armenian attack. this casts doubt on the sincerity of russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict. it is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of armenia have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of csce. the document contains the appeal to the world community to stop armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0-- serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and

"wholly opportunistic the dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro-nazi, pro-russia, pro-soviet armenia, pro-arab, pro-jewish, as well as anti-jewish, anti-zionist, anti-communist, and anti-soviet - whichever was expedient."[1] [1] john roy carlson (arthur derounian), 'cairo to damascus,' alfred a. knopf, new york, 1951, p. 438. as a dear friend put it, the tzeghagrons (armenian racial patriots) was the youth organization of the dashnaktzoutun. it was based in boston (where asala/sdpa/arf terrorism triangle is located) but had followers in armenian colonies all over the world. literally tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' the architect of the armenian racial patriots was garegin nezhdeh, a nazi armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with hitler in world war ii. in 1933, he had been invited to the united states by the central committee of the dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the american-armenian youth. nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local armenian youth groups in the tzeghagrons. starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful nazi armenian organization. nezhdeh also provided the tzeghagrons with a philosophy: "the racial religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity. race above everything and before everything. race comes first."[1] [1] quoted in john roy carlson (real name arthur derounian), "the armenian displaced persons," in 'armenian affairs,' winter, 1949-50, p. 19, footnote. now wait, there is more. the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over nagorny karabakh. the figure is drawn from azeri investigators, hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians. the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku. later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief-stricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead. the state prosecuter, aydin rasulov, the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the "hojali disaster", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings. a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali. an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. this figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence. francois zen ruffinen, head of delegation of the international red cross in baku, said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from hojali, most of them civilians. "we did not count the bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy," mr zen ruffinen said. "we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead." mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre. "don't get worked up. it will take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 1990. those nationalists, the popular front, finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali, an azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians. officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department. "this is just a small percentage of the dead," said rafiq youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. "they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours." of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old. gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. exposure in the highland snows killed the last three. thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out, according to professor youssifov's report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said. files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here, six policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov, an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27 february. "there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500 in hojali, 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around nakhchivanik village," mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot. "people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return." there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces. the independent, london, 12/6/'92 serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

[h] however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane [h] to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one [h] that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane [h] (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia. [h] no, henrik, these turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked. [he]	don't speak about things you don't know: 8 american cargo planes [he]	were heading to armenia. when the turkish authorities [he]	announced that they were going to search these cargo [he]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in germany. [he]	5 of these planes were searched in turkey. the content of [he]	of the other 3 planes? not hard to guess, is it? it was sure not [he]	humanitarian aid..... your "facts" in error. shipments of all kinds that have transversed turkey have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. some american planes were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering armenian from turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of armenia. wheat was confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, then shipped to armenia. u.s. planes don't have to use turkish air bases. the u.s. uses these bases to bomb iraq. anyway, u.s. planes can fly over georgia, which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid turkish military. [he]	search turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about.

i have found jewish people very imagentative and creative. jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and islam. in other words judaism has fathered both religions. now islam has turned against its father i may say. it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. i thought the idea of believing on one god, was to unite all man kind. how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god, "the god of ebrahim" are killing each other? is this like dr. frankenstien's story? how are you going to stop this from happening? how are you going to deal with so many muslims. nuking them would distroy the whole world? would god get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same god, same heaven and the same hell after all? what is the peacefull way of ending this saga? man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state. a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society. the praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. god does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays. religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion? so they may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to make their living. i.e muslims have to pay %20 percent of their income to the mullahs. i guess the rabie gets his cut too! is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other helps one another, respect the mother nature. is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today? is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will see the outcome of his choice. how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. how can we stop another religious killing field, under poor gods name? what are your thoughts? do you think man kind would to come its senses, before it is too late? p.s. on the side do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina? why would god go to top of the mountain? he created the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skies/heavens? why god kept coming back to middle east? was it because they created god through their imagination? is that why jewish people were told by god, they were the chosen ones? profit mohammad was married to khadijeh. she was a jewish. she taught him how to trade. she probably taught him about judaism. quran is mostly copy right of taurah (sp? old testement). do you think god wrote quran? makeh was a trade city before islam. do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business? is that why god has put his house in there? i think this religious stuff has gone too far. all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up. look at david koresh, how that turned out? i am afraid in the bigger scale, the jews and the muslims will have the same ending!!!!!!!! religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than plotting each others distruction. there is one earth, one life and one god. let's all man kind be good toward each other. god help us all. peace

[i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel, but i suspect what i've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved] bm] yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes bm] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm] the parties to the negotiating table. that's hard to do when armenians bm] are attacking azeri towns. henrik]	 so, let me understand in plain words what you are saying; turkey henrik]	 wants a peaceful end to this conflict. not !! so what do you think we want? war, death and destruction? henrik]	 i will believe it when i see it. no, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it. henrik] now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrik]to your head ? do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef(fat chance)? 	 this kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing. henrik] do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku ? all the henrik] barberian acts especially against mothers and their children. i mean henrik] burning people alive ! now, some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians. one should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive, right? bm] armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's bm] going to cause incessant skirmishes. henrik]	 armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic. they are henrik]	 not asking much. they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik]	 from them and given to azeris by stalin. well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful i'd say). bm] think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent bm] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm] the other out. these people will be neighbors, would it not be better bm] to keep the bad blood between them minimal? henrik]	 don't get me wrong. i also want peaceful solution to the henrik]	 conflict. but until azeris realize that, the armenians in henrik]	 karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion. i don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace. you can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the armenian position is and i'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side. if entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise. armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign relations. yes you can type stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side. you personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just usenet. the people in power shouldn't be so childish. bm] if you belong to the armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes bm] your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm] their blood and future. henrik]	 again, you are taking different turns. armenia has no intension henrik]	 to grab any land from azerbaijan. the armenians in karabakh henrik]	 are simply defending themselves until a solution is set. azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps i've seen support what they'd be saying. it doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner. bm] it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm] craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled. the armenians bm] in armenia and n-k will be there, with the same people you seem to hate bm] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more. the sooner there's peace in bm] the region the better it is for them and everyone else. i'd push for bm] compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading bm] inflammatory half-truths. henrik] it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative. i am absolutely henrik] for it. it didn't look it when i read your posting. it would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness. fair? henrik] but, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself, henrik] you will be wiped out. such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] the armenian massacres. you don't realize i can say the same thing about 'the turkish massacres.' yes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were. let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful. sounds crazy doesn't it? don't do it then. bm

it seems that president clinton can recognize jerusalem as israels capitol while still keeping his diplomatic rear door open by stating that the parties concerned should decide the city's final status. even as i endorse clintons vie w (of course), it is definitely a matter to be decided upon by israel (and other participating neighboring contries). i see no real conflict in stating both views, nor expect any better from politicians. ----- david shalhevet / dshal@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu / university of illinois dept anim sci / 220 pabl / 1201 w. gregory dr. / urbana, il 61801

sorry, arf - you dog, that news was suppressed because the israeli national volleyball team repeatedly spiked it. let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts. (brits lead the way in this regard, with ~220 casualties in the last 2 years.) anyway, yigal would never sue. his life is (presumably) so pristine that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to anyone. might even be good instruction for some people i can think of. me, i _would_ sue! i hate the way sports dominates the media. anyway, the last 3 adl agents watching me die of boredom before filing their reports. i've damaged their atlanta operation something fierce.

attitude of certain greeks still exists in our day. most greeks insist even today, that the 537 year-old capital of the ottoman empire should be called not by its rightful name of istanbul, but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'cons*(whatever).' everyone knows that new york city was once called 'new amsterdam' but dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. the name of stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by volgagrad. china's peking traded its name for beiging long ago. ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic is now santa domingo. zimbabve's old colonial capital salisburry became harrare. these changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world. but, greeks are still determined on calling the turkish istanbul by the name of 'cons*.' how can one explain this total intransigence? what makes greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 ad, and that this predates the discovery of the new world, by 39 years. the declaration of u.s. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later. shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for 'cons*' to be called a turkish city? where is the logic in the greek reasoning, if there is any? how long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization? ancient greece does not exist, any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of anatolia. these undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. it is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus is a greek island. no history book shows that it ever was. it belonged to the ottoman turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years. in fact, prior to the turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the venetians in 1570 ad, the island of cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations: the assyrians, the sumerians, the phoenicians, the egyptians, the ottoman turks, of course in that order, owned it as their territory. but, it has never been the possession of the government of greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. moreover, cyprus is located 1500 miles from the greek mainland, but only 40 miles from turkiye's southern coastline. saddam hussein claims that kuwait was once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek governments think that cyprus also was once part of the greek hegemony. those 'arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality. again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only facts count. as for selanik, <<those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica, whose jewish population increased substantially as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the total population, though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire, particularly to the great port of izmir. despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike, the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on. greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913, following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war, when many of its jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>> <<though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday, stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do. between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-semitic riots in salonica, with the cambel quarter, where most of the remaining jews lived, being burned to the ground. this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judea-spanish in the jewish schools. a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out [47]. by killing and driving out large numbers of jews, the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in 1941. salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence. istanbul, edirne, and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more. nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan. thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded. the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during and after the crimean war, combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire, with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could. from 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 crimean tatars, circassians, and other muslims from north and east of the black sea had entered anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the ottoman wars with russia and the balkan states, with an equal number gaining refuge in the european portions of the empire.>> [47] robert mantran, 'la structure sociale de la communaute juive

" so where are the rest?". some might have taken prisoner, he said, or fled. many bodies were still lying in the mountains because the azeris were short of helicopters to retrieve them. he believed more than 1000 had perished, some of cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. one refugee, rami nasiru, described how khojaly residents at first thought the attack was no more than the routine shooting to which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. but when they saw the armenians with a convoy of armored personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend themselves with machineguns and grenades, and fled into the forests. in the small hours, the massacre started. mr. nasiru, who believes his wife and two children were taken prisoner, repeated what many other refugees have said - that troops of the former soviet army helped the armenians to attack khojaly.

"they have signed contracts to fly for us," he said. the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our russian pilot, but fighting for the armenians. we had taken off just before 5pm on saturday from agdam airfield, an heated for the armenian-controlled mountains of karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. the civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. we then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards azerbaijani lines. azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. back at the airfield in agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. they had been shot. what did our russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in nagorno-karabakh? he gave us cheerful grin, politely declined to answer ques tions, and marched off to his dinner. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

'the most are inside houses. come you and look.' 'no, dammit! my stomach isn't-' 'one is a turkish officer in uniform. him you must see.' "we were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'i don't believe you," i said, but followed to a nail-studded door. the man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. i thought i should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. all looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted, as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone, so i'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals." p. 363 (first paragraph).

'thank you for a lot, dro,' i said to him back in camp.

"it will be three hours to take," dro told me. we'd close in on three sides. "the men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. "that is for morale," dro put in. "we must keep the moslems in terror." "soldiers or civilians?" i asked. "there is no difference," said dro. "all are armed, in uniform or not." "but the women and children?" "will fly with the others as best they may." p. 360. "the ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'djul lies under that,' said dro, pointing. 'our men also attack from the other sides.' then, 'whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. bayonets clicked upon carbines. over plunged archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though i heard our utica brass roar. as i watched from the height, it took ages for djul to show clear. a tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. the came a shrill wailing. now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. a mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. shots wasted, i thought, when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb." p. 361 (fourth paragraph). "corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. the bayonet had gone through her back, i judged, for blood around was scant. between the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun dress. the next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. he lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed just below his neck, into the spine. there were grownups, too, i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro's german-speaking colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead." p. 358. "...more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled north. my hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - christian, red or tartar - coming in from transcaucasus. then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'armenian' vilayets of turkey under the control of erevan... an armenia without armenians! turks under christian rule? his lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. that's bloodshed - just smyrna over again on a bigger scale." source: "u.s. library of congress": 'bristol papers' - general correspondence container #34.

i flipped on my local cable access channel (a channel where any community member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50 per half hour) and saw a "documentary" (i use this term loosely) on the conflict in the west bank. it was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was terrible, and the camera was really jumpy). the documentary (sic) told the tales of all of the children who died in the "war" against the jews as martyrs. it was a regular sob story. one "victimized youth" was recounting on how all he "really" wants to do is to get an education and that the big bad jews won't let him go to high school. he admittedly spent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a jewish woman but claims that it was "for the cause." i have seen this kind of garbage before. i have a lot of sympathy for the palestinian cause (as do many jews), but i think that even many arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary! the most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end was an address for the makers of the film named jewish comm. on the middle east. anybody heard of them? they make peace now look like right-wingers. gedaliah friedenberg -=-department of mechanical engineering -=-department of metallurgy, mechanics and materials science -=-michigan state university

accounts of anti-armenian human right violations in azerbaijan #010 prelude to current events in nagorno-karabakh +-------------------------------------------------------+ | | | on the way the driver says, "in fact there aren't any | | armenians left. 'they burned them all, beat them all, | | and stabbed them." | |							| +-------------------------------------------------------+ deposition of vanya bagratovich bazian born 1940 foreman baku spetsmontazh administration (umsmr-1) resident at building 36/7, apartment 9 block 14 sumgait [azerbaijan] during the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of february], i was away on a business trip. on the 10th i had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the zhdanov district. that's in azerbaijan, near the nagorno karabagh region. after the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in karabagh, specifically in stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. they said "uprising" in azerbaijani, but i don't think it was really an uprising, just a demonstration. after that the unrest started. several armenians living in the zhdanov district were injured. how were they injured? they were beaten, even women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, and went from here to karabagh to demonstrate. after that i felt uneasy. there were some conversations about armenians among the local population: the armenians had done this, the armenians had done that. right there at the site. i was attacked a couple of times by kids. well true, the guys from my crew wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. after that i felt really bad. i didn't know where to go. i up and called home. and my children tell me, "there's unrest everywhere, be careful." well i had a project going on. i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site. they wouldn't allow it, they said, "nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you." well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. this man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us, too. i sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, "the situation is very tense, be careful." we finished the job at the site, and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. when we left the guys warned me, they told me that i shouldn't tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian. i took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of zardali, and hid my own. i hid it and my passport in my socks. we set out for baku. our guys were on the bus, they sat behind, and i sat up front. in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait. i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. that the city is closed off and the buses aren't running. buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes. and suddenly--no buses. well, we tried to get there via private drivers. one man, an azerbaijani, said, "let's go find some other way to get there." they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait. he took us there. but the others had said, "i wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles." "why?" "because they're burning the city and killing the armenians. there isn't an armenian left." well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up. so we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we set off for sumgait. on the way the driver says, "in fact there aren't any armenians left. 'they burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them." well i was silent. the whole way--20-odd miles--i was silent. the driver asks me, "how old are you, old man?" he wants to know: if i'm being that quiet, not saying anything, maybe it means i'm an armenian. "how old are you?" he asks me. i say, "i'm 47." "i'm 47 too, but i call you 'old man'." i say, "it depends on god, each person's life in this world is different." i look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. well after that he was silent, too. we're approaching the city, i look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. i'm sitting there with them, i start waving my hand, too. i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us. i look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street, you know, and there's no traffic. well probably i was scared. they stopped our car. people were standing on the sidewalks. they have armature shafts, and stones . . . and they stopped us . . . along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an armenian and who's not. the armenians usually . . . for example, i'm an armenian, but i speak their language very well. well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for "nut," or "little nut," as "pundukh," but "fundukh" is actually correct. the pronunciations are different. anyone who says "pundukh," even if they're not armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. another one says, "there was a car there, with five people inside it," he says. "they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. and they didn't let the people out," he says, "they wouldn't let them get out of the car." i only saw the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back . . . when they stop us we all get out of the car. i look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. "we're azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no armenians here." he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says, "maybe you're an armenian, old man?" but in azerbaijani i say, "you should be ashamed of yourself!" and . . . he left. turned and left. that was all that happened. what was i to do? i had to . . . the city was on fire, but i had to steal my children out of my own home. they stopped us at the entrance to mir street, that's where the kavkaz store and three large, 12-story buildings are. that's the beginning of down-town. i saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. i couldn't figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets. later i was told it was a zhiguli. and the people in there were completely incinerated. nothing remained of them, not even any traces. that driver had told me about it, and i saw the car myself. the car was there. the skeleton, a metallic carcass. about 30 to 40 yards from the kavkaz store. i see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. the hatches are closed. and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. and i hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. several shots. there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. someone in the crowd was shooting. apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something. at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier. and all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning off sumgait. i walked on. i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant. i can tell by their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. i joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. but i avoided the large groups because i'm a local and might be quickly recognized. i tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. well so i walked into microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. i can't get into our block, but i walked where there were fewer people, so as to get around. well there i see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking behind him. and he's shouting into a megaphone: "comrades, the armenian- azerbaijani war has begun!" the police have megaphones like that. so they're talking and walking around the second microdistrict. i see that they're coming my way, and turn off behind a building. i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. what they were doing i can't say, because i couldn't get up close to them, i was afraid. but the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . . april 20, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 158-160 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

it seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested who is behind the center for polict research. i will oblige. my name is elias davidsson, icelandic citizen, born in palestine. my mother was thrown from germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'jews'). she was forced to go to palestine due to many cynical factors. i have meanwhile settled in iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). these people include my neighbors in jerusalem with the children of whom i played as child. their crime: theyare not jews. my conscience does not accept such injustice, period. my work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. those who protest against such practices in arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from israel. the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal. the center for policy research is a name i gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in iceland. it is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds. professionally i am music teacher and composer. i have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in europe. i would hope that discussion about israel/palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. calling names is not helpful. elias davidsson iceland
in my postings i have made a proposal for comments and discussion. those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so. however i would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. i cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and i urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats. ps: my proposal has nothing to do with nazi eugenics. it has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. i don't consider that justice is done, when non-jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. this can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. it can never be called justice. and peace without justice will never be peace. it is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as israel does), is not normal. such a state resembles more nazi germany and south africa than western democracies, such as the united states, in which jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. my proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.when the day will come and israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a fund would not be needed any more. i don't mind if jews wish to marry jews and keep their traditions, why not ? but this is not the affairs of a state. western democracy clearly separates these domains and i am certain that most american jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed christian state and to have their green cards stamped with a mark jew. i would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that jews who respect judaism are uncivilized. such behaviour is not good for judaism. elias
april 24th is approaching, and armenians around the world are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members by the turkish government between 1915 and 1920. at least 1.5 million armenians perished during that period, and it is important to note that those who deny that this event ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate the armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in azerbaijan, would like to see it happen again... thank you for taking the time to read this post. -helgge

"i'm still wearing the same clothes, i don't have any others," the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the hojali disaster. "i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to be alive." mr sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh. "at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy machine-guns, the lot," mr sadikov said. soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side. to escape, the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about 15 miles away. they thought they were going to make it, until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak. "none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by a car on the road, and the armenian outposts started opening fire," mr sadikov said. azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman son. seven of his immediate relations died, including his 67-year-old elder brother. "i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. "we have never got any of the bodies back." the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. one hero of the evacuation, alif hajief, was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing, mr sadikov said. another hero, elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali, said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam, there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee. "the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack. some people just kept going," mr sadikov said.

dear mr. davidsson, you claim that your purpose is to fight racism. but you don't seem to have any interest in injustice except that which may have been committed by israel. the treatment of jews in arab nations, an injustice of staggerring proportions, is an injustice that you do not seem to care the least bit about. why not?

attention israel line recipients friday, april 16, 1993 two arabs killed and eight idf soldiers wounded in west bank car bomb explosion israel defense forces radio, galei zahal, reports today that a car bomb explosion in the west bank today killed two palestinians and wounded eight idf soldiers. the blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the idf and the other civilian. both busses went up in flames. the blast killed an arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the mehola settlement. an israel radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. according to officials at the haemek hospital in afula, the eight idf soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries. -danny keren

"don't fear," he said, "it's nothing, nothing all that bad." he didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. and just then on television they broadcast that two azerbaijanis had been killed in karabakh, near askeran. when i heard that i couldn't settle down at all, i kept walking here and there and i said, "they're going to kill us, the azerbaijanis are going to kill us." and he says, "don't be afraid." then we heard--from the central square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. i say, "you speak azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying." he says "close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there." he listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed, and told us, "come on, go to sleep, it's nothing." sleep, what did he mean sleep? my son and i stood at the window until two in the morning watching. well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. i say, "igor, you go to bed, i'm going to go to bed in a minute too." he went and i sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. things had calmed down slightly. the 28th, sunday, was my day off. my husband got up and said, "come on, emma, get up." i say, "today's my day off, let me rest." he says, "aren't you going to make me some tea?" well i felt startled and got up, and said, "where are you going?" he says, "i'm going out, i have to." i say, "can you really go outside on a day like today? don't go out, for god's sake. you never listen to me, i know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take the car out of the garage, go without the car." and he says, "come on, close the door!" and then on the staircase he muttered something, i couldn't make it out, he probably said "coward" or something. i closed the door and he left. and i started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. i said, "khalida, was it our car?" she says, "no, no, emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and zhigulis.'' our car is a gaz-21 volga. and i waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven i said, "oh, they've killed shagen!" tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and i'm afraid, i'm standing on the balcony and i'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. my god, they've probably killed him! so basically i waited like that until ten o'clock and he still hadn't come home. and i'm afraid to go out. at ten o'clock i look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. i'm looking out of one window and igor is looking out of the other, and i don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see it. we wanted to hide it from one another. i joined him. "mamma," he says, "look what they're doing over there!" they were burning everything, and there were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony. and one of the ones on the balcony is shouting, "what are you standing there for, burn it!" when they threw the television, wow, it was like a bomb! our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted, "why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home. why are you burning them?" and from the courtyard they yell at her, "go inside, go inside! instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not?" they meant armenians, but they didn't say armenians, they said, "of them." she says, "no, no, no, none!" then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, "emma, emma, you have to leave!" i say, "they've killed shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? it won't be living for me without shagen. let them kill us, too!" she insists, saying, "emma, get out of here, go to khalida's, and give me the key. when they come i'll say that it's my daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone." i gave her the key and went to the neighbor's, but i couldn't endure it. i say, "igor, you stay here, i'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe papa's . . . papa's there." meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, alik and valery [albert and valery avanesians; see the accounts of rima avanesian and alvina baluian], in the courtyard. there is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, and i didn't think that they were killing at the time. alik and valery lived in the corner house across from ours. when i went out into the courtyard i saw an azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. i say, "madar, uncle shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. "he shouts, "aunt emma, where do you think you're going?! go back into the house, i'll look for him." i say, "something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, madar, i'm coming too." well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, "you stay here with us, i'm go look." he went and looked, and came back and said, "aunt emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. "madar went off again and then returned and said, "aunt emma, they're already killed alik, and valery's there . . . wheezing." madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, "don't go near him, or we'll put you next to him." he got scared--he's young--and came back and said, "i'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take alik, maybe he'll live . . . " they grew up together in our courtyard, they knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. he went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. he called, and called, and called, and called--nothing. i went upstairs to the neighbor's. igor says, "two police cars drove up over there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . "we watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. i didn't take my clothes off. i lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning i got up and said, "igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, i'm going to look, i have to find papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . i've got the keys from work." at six o'clock i went to the emergency hospital. the head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue. i run up to them and say, "doctor, is shagen there?" he says, "what do you mean? why should shagen be here?!" i wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. there were only four people in there, they said. well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. they said, "shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back." it's already seven o'clock in the morning. i look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. some of our people from the hospital were there with them. i say, "sara baji ["sister" sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought shagen." i said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, "no, emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person." now shagen just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. when they said it like that i guessed immediately. i went and said, "doctor, they've brought shagen in dead." he says, "why are you carrying on like that, dead, dead . . . he's alive." but then he went all the same, and when he came back the look on his face was . . . i could tell immediately that he was dead. they knew one another well, shagen had worked for him a long time. i say, "doctor, is it shagen?" he says, "no, emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely." i say, "doctor, why are you deceiving me, i'll find out all the same anyway, if not today, then tomorrow." and he said . . . i screamed, right there in the office. he says, "emma, go, go calm down a little." another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was shagen, but . . . in hideous condition. they tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't shagen. a few minutes later another colleague comes in and says, "oh, poor emma!" when she said it like that there was no hope left. that day was awful. they were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people. at night someone took me home. i said, "igor, papa's been killed." on the morning of the 1st i left igor at home again and went to the hospital: i had to bury him somehow, do something. i look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers. they are wearing dark clothes. "hey, citizen, where are you going?" i say, "i work here," and from inside someone shouts, "yes, yes, that's our cook, let her in." i went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the city health department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. he says, "emma, shagen's been taken to baku. in the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to baku." i say, "doctor, how will i bury him?" he says, "we're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. where did you spend the night?" i say, "i was at home." he says, "what do you mean you were at home?! you were at home alone?" i say, "no, igor was there too." he says, "you can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for igor, you go and bring igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ..." his last name is kagramanov. the head doctor's name is izyat jamalogli sadukhov. the "ambulance" arrived and i went home and got igor. they admitted him as a patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. we stayed in the hospital until the 4th. some police car came and they said, "emma, let's go." and the women, our colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, "where are you taking her?" i say, "they're going to kill me, too . . . " and the investigator says, "why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification." we went to baku and they took me into the morgue . . . i still can't remember what hospital it was . . . the investigator says, "let's go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not shagen." and when i saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, i went out of my mind. i say, "i can't look, no." the investigator says, "are there any identifying marks?" i say, "let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, i'll recognize them." he says, "isn't they're anything on his body?" i say he has seven gold teeth and his finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . . they brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they brought them and they were all burned . . . when i saw them i shouted, "oh, they burned him!" i shouted, i don't know, i fell down . . . or maybe i sat down, i don't remember. and that investigator says, "well fine, fine, since we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . " on the 4th they told me: "emma, it's time to bury shagen now." i cried, "how, how can i bury shagen when i have only one son and he's sick? i should inform his relatives, he has three sisters, i can't do it by myself." they say, "ok, you know the situation. how will they get here from karabagh? how will they get here from yerevan? there's no transportation, it s impossible." he was killed on february 28, and i buried him on march 7. we buried him in sumgait. they asked me, "where do you want to bury him?" i said, "i want to bury him in karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in karabagh," i'm shouting, and the head of the burial office, i guess, says, "do you know what it means, take him to karabagh?! it means arson!" i say, "what do you mean, arson? don't they know what's going on in karabagh? the whole world knows that they killed them, and i want to take him to karabagh, i don't have anyone anymore." i begged, i pleaded, i grieved, i even got down on my knees. he says, "let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, if it calms down, i'll help you move him to karabagh . . . " our trial was the first in sumgait. it was concluded on may 16. at the investigation the murderer, tale ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. then they brought a videotape recorder, i guess, and played it, and said, "ismailov, look, is that you?" he says, "yes." "well look, here you're describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?" he says, "yes." "and now you're telling it differently?" he says, "well maybe i forgot!" like that. the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along mir street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . shagen had a volga gaz-21. the 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were involved. one of them was this ismailov guy, this tale. they--it's unclear who--started pulling shagen out of the car. well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. they pulled off his sports jacket. he had a jacket on. well they ask him, "what's your nationality?" he says, "armenian." well they say from the crowd they shouted, "if he's an armenian, kill him, kill him!" they started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . i don't know, they did something there, too . . . it's too awful to tell about. anyway, they say this tale guy . . . he had an armature shaft. he says, "i picked it up, it was lying near a bush, that's where i got it." he said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. he said, "i hit him twice," he said, " . . . once or twice on the head with that rod." and he said that when he started to beat him shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. he said, "i left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone," he says, "and i came back to look, is that shagen alive or not?" i said, "you wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?" he went back and looked and he was already dead. "after that," that bastard tale said, "after that i went home." i said, "you . . . you . . . little snake," i said, "are you a thief and a murderer?" shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. they were taken. he says he didn't take them when they overturned and burned the car, that tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. i told the investigator, "how can you have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?" he said something, but i didn't get what he was saying. but i said, "you still haven't straightened everything out, i think that's unjust." when they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. in the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . . and i ask again, why was he killed? my husband was a carpenter; he was a good craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his own hands. we have three children. three sons. only igor was with me at the time. the older one was in pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the army. and now they're fatherless... i couldn't sit all the way through it. when the procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, i just . . . i went out of my mind, i didn't know what to do with myself, i said, "how can that be? you," i said, "you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' deprivation of freedom?" i screamed, i had my mind! i said, "let me at that creep, with my bare hands i'll . . . " a relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . i lest. i said," this isn't a soviet trial, this is unjust!" that's what i shouted, l said it and left . . . i said that on february 27, when those people were streaming down our street, they were shouting, "long live turkey!" and "glory to turkey!" and during the trial i said to that ismailov, "what does that mean, 'glory to turkey'?" i still don't understand what turkey has to do with this, we live in the soviet union. that turkey told you to or is going to help you kill armenians? i still don't understand why "glory to turkey!" i asked that question twice and got no answer . . . no one answered me . . . may 19, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 178-184 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

are you trying to say that there were no massacres in deir yassin or in sabra and shatila? if so then let me tell you some good jokes: there is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in wwii palestinians just did what davidians did for fourty years and more. in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place. people die that is all. no one gets killed. maybe also vietamiese didn't die in vietnam war killed by american napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all. maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. no? what do you think of this ? isn't it stupid to say so? well it is as stupid as what you said .next time you want to lie do it intelligently. sincerely yours. hassan
only brendan mckay, or maybe arf, would come to the rescue of nazi racial theory. is it distressing brendan? the point is that any eugenic solution to the jewish problem as elias has proposed smacks of pure nazism. the fact that elias' proposal cast the entire "problem" as one of the abnormal presence of israeli society in the middle east, and that he buried a slam against u.s. aid to israel in the midst of his "even-handed" solution of the jewish question, made it obvious what he had in mind: disolving the jewish polity. that *is* a nazi doctrine: rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the jewish people within a larger body politic. whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary incentives to the poor jews to marry out, or as feisal husseini has said, "disolve the zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal surrounding arab culture," you are engaged in a nazi project. just as obvious is your statement: "i will not comment on the value or lack of value of elias's proposal." still striking the glancing blow, right brendan? you could easily see where he was going, but you "will not comment." so, you are complicitous. what is your fascination with nazi racial theory, anyway? -- chris metcalfe ("someone else") !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in article <1993apr22.175022.15543@cs.rit.edu> bdm@cs.rit.edu (brendan d mckay) writes: >>>a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle-east. >>>---------------------------------------------------------- by >>>			 elias davidsson >>> >>>5. the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' >>>marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on >>>'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its >>>ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a >>>truly civil society. the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of >>>people would also help the integration of israeli society into the >> >> sounds just like a racial theory that hitler outlined in mein kampf. > >someone else said something similar. i will not comment on the >value or lack of value of elias's "proposal". i just want to say >that it is very distressing that at least two people here are >profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine. they were not >like elias's idea, they were more like the opposite. > >nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation. an >instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies. according to >nazi theoreticians, gypsies were an aryan race. they were persecuted, >and in huge numbers murdered, because most european gypies were >considered not pure gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure gypsy >race and other undesirable races. this was the key difference between >the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies, by the way. it is also >true that towards the end of wwii even the "purist" gypsies were >hunted down as the theory was forgotten. > >brendan. >(email: bdm@cs.anu.edu.au)

04/16/93 1045 armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes by david ljunggren moscow, april 16, reuter - armenia accused turkey on friday of flying weapons x and troops across armenian airspace to azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in yerevan said. separately, itar-tass news agency said armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of azerbaijan and sent tensions in the transcaucasian region soaring. the journalists in the armenian capital quoted armen duliyan, head of the armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to azerbaijan with arms and troops. it looks as though the armenian leadership will have to warn turkey about the impermissibility of such actions," the journalists quoted duliyan as saying. "if such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. we have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units." turkey, which shares a border with armenia, has supported azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly armenian-populated nagorno-karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988. the turkish foreign ministry said on friday it had so far sent one plane to azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid. a turkish foreign ministry spokesman on thursday would not comment directly on a report by hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in azerbaijan from turkey. duliyan said turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering azeri autonomous territory of nakhichevan, from where they were flown across armenian airspace to the azeri capital baku. "all the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace," he said. armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself. tass said the karabakh forces decided on friday to suspend their offensive along the entire armenian-azerbaijani front. "the karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire," the agency said. armenian president levon ter-petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in karabakh when he arrived in the belarus capital minsk on friday for a summit of commonwealth leaders. "the first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the karabakh population," tass quoted him as saying. at least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed. "the second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of nagorno-karabakh," he said. the republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country. armenia insists that a separate karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something azerbaijan rejects. local news agencies in baku said on friday that interior minister iskender gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with armenia, had resigned. turan news agency said he quit on thursday and had cleared his office. khabar-servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of baku, police major-general abdullah allakhverdiyev. there was no official confirmation. -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

mack posted: "i know nothing about statistics, but what significance does the relatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period is so small (at the end of 1371)?" this is not small. a 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. can you imagine that? most people seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists, for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates, but large environmental impact). iran's high growth rate threatens things like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and water table drop. similar to what is going on in california (this year's rain won't save you in stanford!). this is probably more to blame than the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards in iran. -- gruss, dr bruce scott the deadliest bullshit is max-planck-institut fuer plasmaphysik odorless and transparent bds at spl6n1.aug.ipp-garching.mpg.de -- w gibson

" and something else along that line. i didn't understand what it was all about. i walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. but the circle drew in tighter. new people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. and the comments started: "right, we should slaughter the armenians!" and "there's no need to be afraid, all of moscow is behind us." i even heard that: "all moscow is behind us." well i watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. i quietly left and went home. now before that at work i had heard that something was going on in karabagh, that there were demonstrations there. well, people were saying all kinds of things, but i didn't have any idea what was really going on. my wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in baku. i didn't say anything to my wife. we sat and drank tea. sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and shouting. i looked out the window and saw a crowd. the crowd is moving slowly, like they show on tv when blacks in south africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly. my wife asks what's going on out there. i say i don't know. i put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. in the crowd people are shouting "down with the armenians!" and "death to the armenians!" i waited for the entire crowd to pass. at first they went down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee; then they turned and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the street of the 26 baku commissars toward the streetcar line. i went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. in fact i thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh. aside from the things they were shouting, i was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. and they were minors, under draft age. my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but i was kind of uneasy and said, "no, let's stay at home instead." an hour went by, or maybe an hour and a half. well, i wasn't keeping track of the time, i can't say exactly how long it was. i look and see another crowd on narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the rossiya movie theater. i put outside clothes on and went out again. there's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. there are more people. and whereas the first time there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more aggressive. no, i think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. they would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run again. i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. i followed them. i was thinking i'd just watch and see. who knew where this was leading? we came out on lenin square. at the square the sk club is on one side, and the city party committee is on the other. i went toward the square and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. there was some sort of a rally going on. i go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. i heard both anti-armenian and anti-soviet appeals. "we don't need perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been." now what did they mean by "living like we have been?" the azerbaijanis work like everyone else. but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. and not just in azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but i've never seen it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan. now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians' apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. true, i didn't hear them say "kill them" over the microphone, i only heard "beat them and drive them out." i stayed at the square a few minutes longer. first one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and i think they were mvd [ministry of internal affairs] or state security kgb. there were also uniformed policemen there, but i didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd. new people kept coming up onto the stage. well i had finally decided that this could end badly: this was no demonstration, and i had to protect my family. i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. it was next to the city party committee, on narimanov street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. i see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. i decided to go look because after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. they pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the city party committee, but toward the sk club. and when i went right up to them i saw that they were cases of vodka. there were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 to 20. they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. two people, one case of vodka. and there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. it was anasha. when i passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. there was about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. he has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. i have never smoked it myself. once i tried it for fun, but i've seen a lot of people smoke it, i've seen it many times, and i know what it is. i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there. before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling, more warlike shouting. i turned around and saw them running. well i'll just keep on going like i am, i thought. when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags. and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. he's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. he was carrying a red flag, which had "ermeni oryum" written on it in azerbaijani, that means "death to armenians!" that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. i don't really know what his name is, but i know his father very well. his father's name is rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. he used to have a dark blue zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli 06. his family, as i said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. our building was on narimanov street, and theirs was on the street of the 26 baku commissars; their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the left. now rafik's little brother lives there, and he, rafik, i heard, got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. in a word, his son was carrying a flag that said "death to armenians!" i was surprised because before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from sumgait, but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan. well anyway i went home. my wife was upset. i told her, "it's ok, it'll pass, they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up." naturally i didn't want her to get overly upset. after a while a new surge of crowd went by. and this time they were breaking glass. i could hear it breaking, but i couldn't see where. well i think, here we go, the machine's in motion. they weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. i didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window! so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, i'll say it again, the police were there, i saw them. and it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. true, at the time i couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and i'm not afraid to say these words: so many people died, so many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--i couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if i were to be specific, i would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of sumgait, i couldn't imagine that such things could take place. when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son: "let's go upstairs." we went to our neighbors, the grigorians, on the fourth floor. and in the evening, when those crowds started going past again, i went outside once more. i stopped at "the corner," a place called that right next to the bazaar. i look and see a crowd on the run. and there, a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. and then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. and not a soul went past those three, as though it were off limits! well everything got all churned up, there was more noise, and the glass was flying again. we spent the night at the neighbors'. my apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there. in the morning i went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. on the way i saw someone hunched up, still. i never found out who it was or what happened to him. there were 10 to 15 people standing near him. i got the bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him. that was on the morning of february 28. everyone knows the rest. may 17, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 161-164 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992
	washington (upi) -- a senior state department official on tuesday ruled out any softening of u.s. attitudes toward iraq but said relations with iran's islamic regime could improve substantially if that government disassociates itself from international terrorism. 	``despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility towards the islamic republic of iran,'' david mack, deputy assistant secretary for near eastern affairs, said. 	the primary u.s. objection is ``iran's international behaviour'' which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the arab israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons. 	mack said ``iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.'' 	mack spoke at the u.s.-gcc business conference aimed at promoting gulf-american trade. he said the ``middle east will be an item very high on the agenda of the u.s. administration.'' 	the importance of the gulf is underlined by secretary of state warren christoper's visit last year to saudi arabia and kuwait before anywhere else in the world, mack said. he added that the u.s. has no long-term plan to station troops in the gulf. 	mack also insisted that the clinton administration will continue to pressure iraq to ``comply with all the u.n. security resolutions.'' 	``as long as iraq is ruled by saddam hussein we do not expect compliance,'' mack told delegates.

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: symbiotics: zionism-antisemitism zionism and the holocaust -------------------------- by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-semitism, namely that jews cannot live with non- jews. the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way. while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th century. jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe. when the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence. the socialist bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political zionists. in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe. while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europe's workers, the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state. historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. history can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd reich. the zionist federation of germany (zvfd), an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews, was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich. its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. from a marginal position, the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. all of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the 'jewish problem'. their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in germany (and some other countries in europe) into a real option to be considered by german jews. the best example of this was the 'transfer agreement' of 1934. immediately after the nazi takeover in 1933, jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods. this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse. this problem was solved by the zvfd. a letter sent to the nazi party as early as 21. june 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime: "the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development. boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways - is in essence unzionist, because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build." in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. the main public act was the signature of the "transfer agreement" with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of 1934. in essence, the agreement was designed to get germany's jews out of the country and into mandate palestine. it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of german goods to palestine. this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination. the zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. this agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the jews. after all, they argued, the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them. after news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary. baron von mildenstein, the first head of the jewish department of the ss, later followed by eichmann, was invited to travel to palestine. this he did in early 1933, in the company of a zionist leader, kurt tuchler. having spent six months in palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the 'new jew' of zionism, a jew nazis could accept and understand. this little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism, between the new regime and the zvfd, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the final solution became clear. in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is post-ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust, by s. b. beth-zvi. in the case of the kastner episode, around which jim allen's play perdition is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. it occured near the end of the war. the ussr had advanced almost up to germany. italy and the african bases had been lost. the nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as rumania, leaving the axis. a second front was a matter of months away, as the western allies prepared their forces. in the midst of all this we find eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his hz in occupied budapest, after the german takeover of the country in april 1944. his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership, and to appoint zionist federation members, headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities. why they did this is not difficult to see. as opposed to poland, where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population, the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community. the middle class was mainly jewish, the jews were mainly middle-class. they enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were hungarian - how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? the task was not easy, there were a million jews in hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials. like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat. in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members. without their help the ss, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. kastner and the others were left under no illusions. eichmann told joel brand, one of the members of kastner's committee, that he intended to send all hungary's jews to auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions! he told them clearly that all these jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met. the committee faced a simple choice - to tell the jews of hungary about their fate, (with neutral rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process. what would not have been believed when coming from the ss, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership. thus it is, that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps. to be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which eichmann promised to kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. for eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews. there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends. no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz. it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration, like say rumkovsky in lodz. kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions. his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs, palgi and senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. at no point during his trial or elsewhere, did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews. to conclude, the role played by zionists in this period, was connected to another role they could, and should have played, that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in europe. they had the information, but politically it was contrary to their priorities. the priorities were, and still are, quite simple: all that furthers the zionist enterprise in palestine is followed, whatever the price. the lives of individuals, jews and non-jews, are secondary. if this process requires dealing with fascists, nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so be it.
from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: hebrew labor: racist connotations avoda ivrit - hebrew labor --------------------------------- "hebrew labor" is a concept which has served the zionist movement for a long time. it has a double-barreled message: 1) the new jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) the land in this country must pass into jewish hands, i.e. to the same new jew who has "learned" to work it. both aspects of the two-pronged concept of "hebrew labor" have racist connotations. on the one hand, the diaspora jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites. on the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the arab farmer from the source of his livelihood. the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of israel relegated the myth of "hebrew labor" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement. it has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the palestinian population. or in the words of environment minister yossi sarid, "i have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives. the israeli government is considering plans to import labor from the far- east to replace native people, palestinians, who work in their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two ethnical communities and ruling over them.
los angeles times, tuesday, april 13, 1993. p. a1. new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge 	* inquiry: transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage 	 by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c. paddock, times staff writer. san francisco -- to the outside world, roy bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district. in reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the anti-defamation league for nearly 40 years. his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arab-american delegation that visited rep. nancy pelosi (d-san francisco) in her washington, d.c., office. for a time, cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes. from police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills. these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz, a former los angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the anti-defamation league. officials of the anti-defamation league, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation. they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz. transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory. at times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like "ironsides" and "flipper." on one occasion, gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa, israel. although the anti-defamation league publicly denies any ties to israel, gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him. shortly afterward, another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him. the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard, a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the anti-defamation league. gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker. its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america; and a collection of blank birth certificates, army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies. also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men. investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the arab-american anti-discrimination committee. each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant. the anti-defamation league, a self-described jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-semitic, extremist or racist. the adl's fact-finding division, headed by irwinn suall in new york, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists. however, evidence seized from bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the american civil liberties union, earth island institute, the united farm workers, jews for jesus, mother jones magazine, the center for investigative reporting, the bo gritz for president committee, the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up. the computer files also included information on several members of congress, including pelosi, house armed services committee chairman ron dellums (d-berkeley) and former republican rep. pete mccloskey from the bay area. in their statements, bullock and gurvitz said the anti-defamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than 30 years. they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a los angeles police department anti-terrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff's department intelligence officer. a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff's department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl. the los angeles police department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the san diego sheriff's department declined comment. bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama. although he is not jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party. bullock moved to los angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative, he told authorities. in the mid-1970s, he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast. to keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, bullock said. "i was an investigator for the adl. i investigated any and all anti-democratic movements," bullock said. ". . . officially, i'm only a contract worker with bruce hochman. that way, the league would not be officially connected with me." bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arab-american to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink. "i'm one of a kind," he told police. in recent years, however, his adl affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him. in the mid-1980s, he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police. in part because of this investigation, he became close friends with gerard, who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division. bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups. an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group: "bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with gerard. bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine. gerard would later return the trash to bullock." from a wide range of sources, bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups. gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people. in 1987, bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government. bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills. bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli -- and submitted it as his own work. bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence. bullock said he split about $16,000 from the south african government evenly with gerard, telling him at one point, "i may be gay but i'm a straight arrow." in his interviews with the police and fbi, bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law. for example, bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer. and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy. bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the anti-defamation league's san francisco office. bullock seemed proud of his "operation eavesdrop," in which he used a paid informant, code-named scumbag, to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group. "for a short time, it was wonderful," he told police. in los angeles, adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a "fact-finder" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups. among other things, he told san francisco authorities, the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arab-american who had "anti-israel leanings" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment. gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies. gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a right-wing hate group. gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe, providing considerable information about the adl operation. unlike bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation. gurvitz declined through his father in los angeles to be interviewed by the times. bullock's attorney said his client would not comment. -- yigal arens usc/isi tv made me do it! arens@isi.edu

well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. what i disagree with is your statement that the u.s. media is out to ruin israels reputation. that is rediculous. the u.s. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world. having lived in europe i realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. the u.s. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. the u.s. is subsidizing israels existance and the europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). so i think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. 	what is a shame is that in austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the government makes some of the holocaust guilt go away. after all, look how the jews are treating other races when they got power. it is unfortunate.

i would like to share with netters a few points i picked up from the pbs frontline program regarding iran's nuclear activities, aired on tuesday april 13. for the sake of brevity, i'll present them in some separate points. 1- as many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer. some of the misinformations were as follows: - it was alleged that:" late imam khomeini objected to shah's technological advancements as anti-islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of change is that some iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. "! these are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives of the islamic revolution in toppling the shah and state of the technology in iran after revolution. -iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against iraqi aggressors while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by iranian chemical weapons, in contrary to what the whole world has seen about iranian soldiers and civilians, injured by iraqi chemical weapons. - while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had a total of one million dead, this program claims that iran alone has one million dead left from the war. - the translation of iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. for example when iranian head of atomic energy says that: " it hurts me to see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda." the translator says: " it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly research."! 2- almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to iran's big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power. 3- the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! taking in account the scientific advancement of sharif u. in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of iran's industries and eventually the lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts. 4- a key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by iaea [*] in their numerous visits from iran's different sites. they say: "we are not sure if the places visited by iaea are the real ones or not" !, or " we can not rely on iaea's reports and observation, because they failed to see iraq's nuclear activities before" as if they didn't know that iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons! 5- as an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs, william triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge! i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media, and i hope iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations. mohammad [*] international atomic energy agency

"however, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the state of israel. the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison." zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister, the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question. "the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment. the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret", wrote zucker. the legal counsel of the civil rights union, attorney mordechai shiffman said that, "we, as the civil rights union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, citizens of israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public. this is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy. just like censorship is an unhealthy matter". "the union is aware", says shiffman, "of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld. i am speaking only of several days. i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest. that is done because of the great secrecy. "the suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court. but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity. the journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy..." attorney yossi arnon, an official of the bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. "nothing is easier. the court orders a publication ban, and that's that. someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it." -- do you find this situation acceptable? attorney arnon: "definitely not. we live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible. i am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. consider the trial of mordechai vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison. the trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to. it is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as i have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment." -- why is the matter actually that serious? can't we trust the discretion of the court? attorney arnon: "the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. the judges do not have the tools to investigate. this gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse." -- and what if there really is a security issue? attorney arnon: "i am a man of the legal system, not a security expert. democracy stands in opposition to security. i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail. we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the rachel heller murder. a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public." attorney shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment. "a healthy situation? definitely not. but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security". a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal, former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir. "clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases. such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression. definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication. "nevertheless", adds shtendal, "the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles i've mentioned. the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt." nevertheless, attorney shtendal agrees: "as a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances." -- yigal arens usc/isi tv made me do it! arens@isi.edu

(i'm not a conspiracy theorist myself, but this one is hard to dismiss). >>as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace, maybe. >>however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish >>state, where jews are in control and jews are the masters of >>the land. living in peace is meaningless unless it means >>living *with* someone else, as equal. for a native arab, this >>does not leave many options. >	oh, you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens? the >arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who >they vote for as the jews. again adam, the devil is in the details. i don't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it has an integer square root. >>those palestinians who stayed, actually stayed despite of what >>happened, and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless >>and ineffective minority. >>if i were wrong, you'd have israel recall all the >>palestinian refugees (we're talking millions). after all, >>they are civilians. >	huh? the people who left, did so voluntarily. there is no >reason for israel to let them in. do you actually believe this? my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home, in palestine. besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell (so to speak). i know none that agrees with you. did you sample their opinions? i know you don't care, just being rethorical. >>israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it >>had to maintain a democratic facade (to keep the western aid >>flowing). >	israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...it >still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained. and how >is granting citizenship a facade? don't get me wrong. i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (jews). israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic cleansing serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the international community, or make the best out of a no win condition: show the world how good israel is towards the 'bad' arabs. personaly, i've never heard anything about the arab community in isreal. except that they're there. so yes, they're there. but as a community with history and roots, its dead. >>	tell me something, sam. what makes land "arab?" >how shall i explain, its a contract between the man and the >land. control isn't it. the ottomans ruled 400 years, and >then left with barely a trace. the concept of land identity >is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west. it is >partly the concept of 'le sol natal', native soil. i know >that jews had previous history in the region, but none in >recent memory. i'm talking everyday life not archeology. >	try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to > establish what it is. >	also, jews did have history in israel for over a thousand >years. there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel. >there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. >jews were a majority in jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards. does that >make the land jewish? i stand corrected. i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history. i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish. so there. what to make of the rest palestine? > adam shostack 				 adam@das.harvard.edu -- sam zbib bell-northern research ------------------------------------------------------------------------ bitnet/internet: zbib@bnr.ca voice: (613) 763-5889 fax: (613) 763-2626 surface mail: stop 162, p.o.box 3511, station c, ottawa, canada, k1y 4h7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ my opinions are my own and no one else's

the armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well. in the may 10, 1936 edition of 'hairenik weekly' the vice-mayor of bucharest, rumania is quoted as saying: "the armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the jewish elements in our country." in another edition, an author named captain george haig writes: "and the type of jew who is imported to palestine...is not anything to be proud about. their loose morals, and other vices were unknown to the arabs prior to balfour declaration, on top of all communist activities were the cause of most of the arab criticism."[1] as uzun exposed, the armenians were fascist. before pearl harbor, the dashnak daily 'hairenik' (not to be confused with the tzeghagrons 'hairenik weekly') expressed pro-nazi sentiments: "and came adolf hitler, after herculean struggles. he spoke to the racial heart strings of the german, opened the fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit of defeatism...at no period since the world war had berlin conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy as now, since hitler's assumption to power...and whatever others may think concerning hitlerism and fascism as a system of government, it is proved that they have revitalized and regenerated the two states, germany and italy."[2] [1] captain george haig, 'the case of palestine,' in hairenik weekly, friday, september 25, 1936.

[the *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as 	"combatants". so, what do you think is the "meaning behind", 	the intention and the effect when an "army" purposely 	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 	like civilians'?

if you do, then why should israel's view of arabs/palestinians be any different? why should they trust the arab/palestinians' words? since they don't, they are very reluctant to give up "tangible assets (land, control of areas) in exchange for "words". for this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of "guarantees" they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached. > >but don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? >if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word >of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the >hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy. absolutely, so are the arabs/palestinians asking first for the israelis "word" in relation to any agreement? no, what is being demanded first is land. when the issue is land, and one party finally gets hold of this "land", what the "other party" does is totally irrelevent. if i now have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back. >afterall, israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from >areas it occupied in lebanon during slg. > > tim, you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been > disarmed. hezbollah remains the only independent militia. hezbollah does > not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up > sheikh mosavi, his wife, and young son. while the "major armaments" (those allowing people to wage "civil wars") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. rocket attacks still continue, and "commando" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). such attacks also continue. > of course, if israel would withdraw from lebanon > and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't > make the lebanese so mad as to do that. bat guano. the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace. >furthermore, with hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible. there is no way these groups can be effectively "disarmed" unless the state is as authoritarian is syria's. the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel, essentially mirroring israel's border secirity on its side. it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory. > >|> once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain >|> control?

i don't think israel or lebanon would like that. > what both "sides" need is to receive something "tangible". the arabs/ palestinians are looking for "land" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel. israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help israel's position), and 2) when it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks tim

the hamas way of death (following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions, the military arm of hamas, an islamic palestinian group. hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation. in december, israel deported more than 400 palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas's kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier. a longer version appears in the may issue of harper's magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.) my name is yasir hammad al-hassan ali. i live in nuseirat [a refugee camp in the gaza strip]. i was born in 1964. i finished high school, then attended gaza polytechnic. later, i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk. i'm married and i have two daughters. the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [israeli] security services. since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. to do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place. in addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them. we don't execute every collaborator. after all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. if, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. he's as dangerous as an israeli soldier, so we treat him like an israeli soldier. there's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. i regard the "isqat" [the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him. a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. the dealers must also be executed. in the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, we can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed. in many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. but when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession. at first, every collaborator denies his crimes. so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need. we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. that kind of talk is convincing. most of them confess after that. others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. then the holdouts confess as well. only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. in that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. in addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. with this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. in every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes. a few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. an although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of god and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one i just mentioned, for execution. when we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. that's why collaborators are strangled. sometimes we ask the collaborator, "what do you think? how should we execute you?" one collaborator told us, "strangle me." he hated the sight of blood. ----- naftaly stramer 			 | intergraph electronics internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com | 6101 lookout road, suite a voice: (303)581-2370 fax: (303)581-9972 | boulder, co 80301 "quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

(...) a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry. we called such soldiers h.i. 'hit by the intifada'. under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the cherry. i sent him to a psychiatrist. but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane ? on fridays, when i come home, my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. the keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that i can go there. i they dare talk to me before, or whenever i don't want them to talk to me, i just grab a chair and smash it instantly. i know it is my nerve: smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. only there i become normal.(...) (...) another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. it was an omelette of sorts. she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. i told her how i shot an arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it. she began to laugh hysterically. i wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails. he shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the arab was burning all over, just beautifully. i was delighted to see it. my pal fired three bullets, two at the arab with the molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. it hit him straight in his ass. we both felt that we'd pulled off something. next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. i reached the spot first. and then that arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. i yelled: 'shut up' and he dared talk back to me in hebrew! so i just laughed straight in his face. i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. then i told him: 'all right, wait a moment'. i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab. i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. i keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. this infuriated me. i got very angry, because i felt i was becoming mad. so i stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. only then she stopped laughing. at first she didn't know what to say. (...) but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. a gull appeared right in the middle of the field. my friend shot it at once. then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. we shot down two deer more and went to take a look. when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. we carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. we were just delighted by that sight. we had hit'em so good ! then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. i approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in. but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. we couldn't explain what had happened to us. we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly. (...) we always go back to places we carried out assignments in. this is why we can see them. when you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. you feel godlike of sorts." (...) both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. danny feels the exact opposite. 'why shouldn't i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well ? why shouldn't i earn $3.000 for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa ? this kind of job suits me perfectly. i have no human emotions any more. if i get a reasonable salary i will have no problem to board a plane to bosnia in order to fight there." transl. by israel shahak.

"you say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?" and once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. the term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings. once again khan yunis. once again demolished homes. last thursday there was a search for wanted people here. once again the idf forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. already three times during the past weeks i have gone out to see the destruction and each time i was more horrifying scenes. this time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the idf estimate, ten of them completely demolished. but not only that: the method has also become more brutal. three weeks ago, in tufah neighborhood in gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes. this time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. this time there was only water. three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. this time the soldier just gold them: piss and shit in your pants. and thus, last thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other. (...) dr. juma'a fuad said al-rubi. the brother from saudi arabia, emerges from among the ruins. ten days ago he arrived for a family visit, mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his father and brothers. on thursday he was handcuffed like everyone else for 12 hours, and later went with everyone to view the destrucion. he tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he is a physician, but only got a shove. like all the rest he also urinated in his pants, while standing with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded for the entire day. juma'a al-rubi studied medicine at cairo university, and for ten years he has been treating wealthy saudis in medina. his wife and four children remained there. now his documents have been lost and he does not know how he will return to them. "there is no humanity", stated the physician from saudi arabia.

"at those moments", omar said, "i felt that he was like a humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat me and say, 'you listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself' and i understood that he was not really a human being". in late october 1992, after 38 days in detention at tulkarm prison, omar jaber was released without charges. "among the jews, as among the arabs, there are good people and bad people", he said after his release, "but there, in tulkarm, in the interrogations rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being". although he left the detention installation in tulkarm bruised and humiliated ("i sat at home for ten days. my hands shook from nerves"), one may consider omar jaber lucky: he got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns. in contrast, hassan bader al-zbeidi, for example, was released seven weeks ago from detention in tulkarm after 33 days in the shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. he doesn't speak or react. mustafa barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early august and was brought to the tulkarm detention installation, left it one day later - dead. "we have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the tulkarm detention installation by shabak interrogators", noted dr. niv gordon, director of the association of israel and palestinian physicians for human rights. (...) the right to complain against the shabak does not excite anan saber makhlouf, a 20 year old student. in fact, he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment. (...follow description of tortures....) omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. "i do not want to talk about it", he finally said, quietly. some time later, embarrased and ashamed, he spoke: "sometimes he beats you and beats you until you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. even the hands of another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room, and the last interrogator says:" now you are kissing my hand, and later if i want, you will kiss my ass." these things take place in an israeli army detention installation, located within the military government compound in tulkarm (west bank). but the shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. in early march the idf allowed representatives of b'tselem, the israeli information center for human rights in the territories, to visit tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation wing. "the interrogation wing is shabak property, being solely under shabak responsibility. all interrogations are performed by it", said lieutnant sharon sho'an, the commander of the installation, according to the internal report written by b'tselem member, yuval ginbar, following the visit. major david pe'er, governing commander of the prison system in the central command, was quoted in the report: "there is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing". transl. by i. shahak
i don't know anything about this particular case, but *other* governments have been known to follow events on the usenet. for example after tienanmien square in beijing the chinese government began monitoring cyberspace. as the former director of peacenet, i am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and international authorities monitoring usenet and other conferences such as those on the institute for global communications. but what's the big deal? you shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this medium in any case. if you are concerned about being monitored, you should use encyrption software (available in igc's "micro" conference). i know for a fact that human rights activists in the balkan-mideast area use encryption software to send out their reports to international organizations. such message *can* be decoded however by large computers consuming much cpu time, which probably the turkish government doesn't have access to. howard frederick, university of california, irvine department of politics and society

the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust is insulting and completely false. any person making such a rude and false comparison is either ignorant of the holocaust, or also ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite. to compare a complicated political situation with the genocide of 6,000,000 jews is racist in and of itself.
as someone who reads israeli newpapaers every day, i can state with absolute certainty, that anybody who relies on western media to get a picture of what is happening in israel is not getting an accurate picture. there is tremendous bias in those stories that do get reported. and the stories that never get mentioned create a completely false picture of the mideast.
how many of you readers know anything about jews living in the arab countries? how many of you know if jews still live in these countries? how many of you know what the circumstances of arabic jews leaving their homelands were? just curious.

here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master race,' for you to avoid... two months ago a plane with 86 bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east. four arab nations refused to grant them asylum. then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them, they were allowed into israel. yes, israel. but when the plane landed, the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make israel look good. it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims. israel moved them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure. the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has. even in the case of the 400 deportees, lebanon was willing to let their so-called arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon. nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel. hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait, just because they were palestinian. the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel. you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel. but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians. to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oil-rich nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews, or your hatred of israel. anti-semitism and anti-zionism is not the same as pro-palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare. >the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the >right to self- administration. they selected jews to pacify the >occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. some >jewish collaborators were killed. israel also wishes to rule over >gaza through arab collaborators. your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised. jews had never declared war on a polish people. jews had never attacked poles with knives, or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks. to take something like the warsaw ghetto(the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview. you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement. here is arguably the single most anti-semitic genocidal document since mein kampf, yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings. your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation. if it were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic manner. >as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible >with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming >israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for >self-determination, it must be concluded that the israeli jewish >society does not consider gazans full human beings. and just how was gaza obtained? do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start? did you know land israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have always started, aren't the same as israel, and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws?

i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing. since you are in general a liar, you'll have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications. > one is led to ask >oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister >goals towards the gazans ?

do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades? or, what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait? or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims? do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring? why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people? why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated? why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven? could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing? the people in gaza are not being exterminated. they aren't being killed. they aren't being raped. they aren't being starved. they aren't being driven from their lands. they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies. but the bosnians are. and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking, in the guise of compassion. your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are. do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you. in your case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time. maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew. it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews. why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence? maybe these fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period. whatever the case may be, it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be. when you realize that you can't care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good. but for now, you are a fruad.

from _myths and facts_, by leonard j. davis, near east research inc., 1989: [pp. 108-109] "unlike the plo's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the 100 troups from the irgun and stern group that struck at deir yassin on april 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance. deir yassin was on the road to jerusalem, which the arabs had blockaded, and it housed iraqi troups and palestinian irregulars. snipers based in deir yassin were a constant threat to jewish citizens in jerusalem. "arab civilians were killed at deir yassin, but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the arabs have tried to paint. the number of arabs killed was generally reported to be about 250. in 1983, however, eric silver of _the guardian_ (britain) interviewed a survivor, mophammed sammour, who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'about three days after the massacre,' sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five clans in deir yassin met at the moslem offices in jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found (alive). we went through the names. nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong.' "unlike the plo's deliberate attacks on civilians, the killing of civilians at deir yassin was not premeditated. the attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed. after the remaining arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the jewish troops, some of the attackers killed arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. independent observers told _the guardian_ that among the bodies they found arab men disguised as women."

the following flyer was distributed at aipac's 34th annual policy conference: because when we're not in israel, we're told to go back where we came from and when we come back to israel we're told to go back to where we came from and when we're vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can afford to because jews are so rich and when we don't buy something it's because we're cheap and because when we are poor we're called dirty jew and ignorant and when we're not we're called called rich jew and jap and when we are visibly organized it's because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and when we're not it is because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and because we're told we're not a people and when we say we are we're still told that we're not and when we marry our own people we're called racist and we don't we're contaminating someone else's "race" and because we're under fire from the left and from the right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because there are non-whites who hate us for being white and because anti-semitic incidents are rising every year but we're told that anti-semitism doesn't exist or that we're paranoid and because we're told to shut up about the holocaust and yet holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are "obnoxious" we're called japs and when we are "nice" we're told we don't act jewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of the jewish national liberation movement: zionism.

the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians 78 years ago in x-soviet armenia is being reenacted again - this time in azerbaijan. the stories of survivors of karabag massacre are in 'milliyet' today. 69 year old hatin nine telling: -''my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. they told me: we won't kill you. but the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu: - ''our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours. while killing children and babies mercilessly they said: you are turks, you must die.'' 28 year old gulsum huseyin: - ''they bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' are these stories lies? have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region? the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists, too. two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article. they[british] reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists. what is more here are the pictures. pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. even the armenian radio couldn't claim these "lies." they are saying "exaggeration." that means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... or gulsum huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. some of the western press', led by some french newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. yesterday we gave samples from le figaro. until yesterday's print no news about the real events in karabag were printed. so were the french tv channels.. the subject they considered related to karabag was ''the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks.'' the age we are living in is termed a human rights age. there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csce(conference on security and cooperation in europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. international reactions must be made with international cooperation. with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? where is the cooperation? where are the reactions? and the intellectuals, journalists, writers, tv stations of certain western countries such as france who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?" where are you? serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

in 1941, while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps, the nazi armenians in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of dro (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds between 1914-1920. an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin, which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged by this, the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler's policy of extermination of the jews. this armenian-nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an "encore" performance staged by the armenians during wwi, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million turks by colluding with the invading russian army. source: "adventures in the near east, 1918-1922" by a. rawlinson, jonathan cape, 30 bedford square, london, 1934 (first published 1923) (287 pages).

"greece government rail-roads two turkish ethnic deputies" while world human rights organizations scream, greeks persistently work on removing the parliamentary immunity of dr. sadik ahmet and mr. ahmet faikoglu. dr. sadik ahmet, turkish ethnic member of greek parliament, visits us washington dc, july 7- doctor sadik ahmet, one of the two ethnic turkish members of the greek parliament visited us on june 24 through july 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level us officials in washington dc and new york. at his press conference at the national press club in washington dc, sadik ahmet explained the plight of ethnic turks in greece and stated six demands from greek government. ahmet said "our only hope in greece is the pressure generated from western capitals for insisting that greece respects the human rights. what we are having done to ethnic turks in greece is exactly the same as south african apartheid." he added: "what we are facing is pure greek hatred and racial discrimination." spelling out the demands of the turkish ethnic community in greece he said "we want the restoration of greek citizenship of 544 ethnic turks. their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of greece for too long. they are greek citizens and are residing in greece, even one of them is actively serving in the greek army. besides, other non-turkish citizens of greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of greek-americans have greek citizenship and they permanently live in the united states." "we want guarantee for turkish minority's equal rights. we want greek government to accept the turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. the greek government is not granting building permits to turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. if your name is turkish, you are not hired to the government offices." "furthermore, we want greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. they do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of greece. in my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in greek hospitals despite the fact that i have finished a greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career." "we want freedom of expression for ethnic turks. we are not allowed to call ourselves turks. i myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because i called myself a turk." "we also want greek government to provide freedom of religion." in separate interview with the turkish times, dr. sadik ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic turks are deplorable and in the eyes of greek laws, ethnic greeks are more equal than ethnic turks. as an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in selanik (thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are turks. that is not because turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. he said that greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. while there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the turkish candidates. ahmet was born in a small village at gumulcine (komotini), greece 1947. he earned his medical degree at university of thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the greek military as an infantryman. in 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic turks. in 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

i think the israeli press might be a tad bit biased in reporting the events. i doubt the propaganda machine of goering reported accurately on what was happening in germany. it is interesting that you are basing the truth on israeli propaganda.

"the crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the muslim population in the soviet republic of armenia, karabag, bosnia and herzegovina is an 'islamic holocaust' comparable to the extermination of 2.5 million muslims by the armenian government during the wwi and of over 6 million european jews during the wwii."

"the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. the estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) moslem. of the latter group, 1,140,000 were tatars. paradoxically, barely one-third of transcaucasia's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia, where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 armenians as compared to 68,000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897, however, the armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. this impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic, a solid block of 370,000 tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia."

"we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." ohanus appressian "men are like that" p. 202. "in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul. it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves. it certainly is possible to severe the artificial life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land."

"in fact we helped greece. because we prevented greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before european countries by forcing the greek government to recognize our legal rights." on turco-greek relations, he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that turkey and greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating, adding that in turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with greece. newspot, january 1993 |3| macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece. two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in athens for alleged crimes against the greek state, according to a court summons (no. 5445) obtained by mils. hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev (or anastasios bulis) have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in an athenian magazine. sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly magazine "ena" on march 11, 1992, and said that they as macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the up-coming greek general election. bulev said in the interview: "i am not greek, i am macedonian." sideropoulos said in the article that "greece should recognise macedonia. the allegations regarding territorial aspirations against greece are tales... we are in a panic to secure the border, at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec are falling." the main charge against the two, according to the court summons, was that "they have spread...intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens, and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country (greece)." the greek state does not recognise the existence of a macedonian ethnicity. there are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic macedonians living within greece, largely concentrated in the north. it is a crime against the greek state if anyone declares themselves macedonian. in 1913 greece, serbia-yugoslavia and bulgaria partioned macedonia into three pieces. in 1919 albania took 50 macedonian villages. the part under serbo-yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent republic of macedonia. there are 1.5 million macedonians in the republic; 500,000 in bulgaria; 150,000 in albania; and 300,000 in serbia proper. sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian human rights in greece, and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago. he was even exiled to an obscure greek island in the mediteranean. only pressure from amnesty international forced the greek government to allow him to return to his home town of florina (lerin) in northern greece (aegean macedonia), where the majority of ethnic macedonians live. balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent, especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour, the republic of macedonia. last year the state department of the united states condemned greece for its bad treatment of ethnic macedonians and turks (who largely live in western thrace). but it remains to be seen if the us government will do anything until the presidential elections are over. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

would it be asking too much for you to document these allegations of "israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters"? i think you confuse israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion of a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke. as for the notion that israel threatens the human rights of palestinians by sealing off the gaza strip, get real. when the palestinian-on-palestinian civil war stops and all palestinians can behave like mature human beings, israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. not before.

aryans who do not base their reasoning on nazi ideology are racists... thus spoke an american citizen in the name of judaism. if this is judaism, i think judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous philosophy. i suspect however that martin buber, albert einstein and other jewish scholars would have rather converted to christianity than stay jews, if they would have perceived judaism as such a perverted philosophy. those who wish to learn something about the perversion of judaism, should consult the masterly work by yehoshua harkabi, who was many years the head of israeli intelligence and an opponent of the plo. his latest book was published in english and includes a very detailed analysis of judeo-nazism.

[afs] [afs] simple as that. can anybody deny these facts? jews killed germans in wwii -- germans killed jews in wwii, but there was quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what nazi revisionists say! [sy] my grand parents were living partly in todays armenia and partly in [sy] todays georgia. there were villages, kurd/turk (different turkic groups) [sy] georgian (muslim/christian) armenian and farsi... very near to eachother. [sy] the people living there were aware of their differences. they were [sy] different people. for example, my grandfather would not have been happy [sy] if his doughter had willed to marry an armenian guy. but that did not [sy] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. no! they were neighbors. ok. [sy] armenians killed turks. which armenians? their neoghbors? as far as my [sy] grandparents are concerned, the armenians attacked first but these [sy] armenians were not their neighbors. they came from other places. maybe [sy] first they had a training at some place. they were taught to kill people, [sy] to hate turks/kurds? it seems so... there is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the armenians of eastern turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the armeno- georgian conflicts of late 1918! the argument is not whether armenians ever killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of anatolian armenians under orders of the turkish government. an armenian- georgian dispute over the disposition of akhalkalak, lori, and pambak after the turkish third army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of anatolian armenians. many armenians and georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. this is not the same as the turkish genocide of the armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away! [sy] anyway, but after they killed/raped/... turks and other muslim people [sy] around, people assumed that 'armenians killed us, raped our women', [sy] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [sy] by some powerful states... after that step, you cannot explain these [sy] people not to hate all armenians. i don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light. [sy] so what am i trying to point out? first, at least for that region, [sy] you cannot blame turks/kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [sy] most of the armenians, i think, are not to blame either. but since some [sy] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. there are facts. [sy] people cannot trust eachother easily. it is very difficult to establish [sy] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [sy] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [sy] very easy to start a fire! again, the fighting between armenians and georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the armenians in turkey. it is interesting that the georgian leaders of the transcaucasian federation (armenia, azerbaijan, and georgia) made special deals with turkish generals not to pass through tiflis on their way to baku, in return for georgians not helping the armenians militarily. of course, as turkish troops marched across what was left of caucasian armenia, many armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. this is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern anatolia. my father's mother's family escaped cemiskezek -> erzinka -> erzerum -> nakhitchevan -> tiflis -> constantinople -> massachusetts. [sy] my grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. we did not experience [sy] what they had to endure... they had to leave their lands, there were [sy] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [sy] witness! young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [sy] unattractive! i don't want to go into any graphic detail. my grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. the turks would kill any armenian young man on sight in dersim. because their family was rather influential, local kurds helped them escape before it was too late. this is why i am alive today. [sy] you may think that my sources are biased. they were biased in some sense. [sy] they experienced their own pain, of course. that is the way it is. but [sy] as i said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. why [sy] should they become enemies? -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

dear mr. beyer: it is never wise to confuse "freedom of speech" with "freedom" of racism and violent deragatory." it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial distinction. indeed, i find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction to the former. racial invective tends to create an atmosphere of intimidation where certain individuals (who belong to the group under target group) do not feel the ease and liberty to exercise *their* fundamental "freedom of speech." this brand of vilification is not sanctioned under "freedom of speech. salam, john absood "marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a meditating buddha. nobody moved for a time...the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the utter- most ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky - seemed to

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: gaza and separation from israel gaza and the idea of separation the israeli left's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. we were able to see this clearly during the gulf war. because of the palestinian's popular solidarity with iraq, yossi sarid - currently minister of the environment - made his infamous statement: "you look for me !", i.e., i'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. from yossi sarid's point of view, palestinian reality during the gulf war was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. similarly meretz, mk deddi tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the west bank town of beit sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a likud government. from the leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is their government, regardless of what it does. these members of the israeli left have already decided how the future of the occupied territories will look, and they want to dictate to the palestinians how to get there. an essential step towards this future is their participation in yitzhak rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this "government of peace", which need not disturb the routine course of events. likewise the "rabinic" policies in gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it. but the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his palestinian workers, or when a palestinian knifes people in the streets of tel aviv. then all hell breaks loose and the israeli left has nothing to propose except separation: let's cut ourselves off from the palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the israeli left. let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation. meron benvenisti writes about this in ha'aretz (4-3-93): "...the liberal left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>. enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....]. "whoover thinks that 'out of gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. it is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. it is very easy to erect a fence between jewish and arab neighborhoods in jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the arabs...". ------------------------------------------------------ >from the other front, jerusalem, 10 march 1993

many of you ask me whether i approve of severe human rights violations by arab states becuse i focus on israeli human rights violations. let's make things clear: my opposition to h.r. violations in arab states is total and without qualification. no arab state is and can claim to be democratic. no arab state claims to be democratic. i am born in palestine (now israel). i have family there. the lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. i am concerned by palestine (israel) because i want peace to come to it. peace and justice. if anybody has legitimate claims towards arab states, he should present his claims and ask for support. jews who left arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has a merit. it is their basic right to return to these countries, if they wish. if not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since israel was established and whose right is upheld by the united nations quasi totally. if jews feel discriminated in arab countries, they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. human rights violations by arab states don't justify, legitimate nor are the cause for israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. israeli breaches stem from the zionist concept, which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to palestinians. israeli trights and palestinian rights are not symmetrical. the first party has a state and the other has none. the first is an occupier and the second the occupied. for any meaningful relationship to emerge, some symmetry must be established. as long as israelis and jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the palestinian people and as long as israelis and jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the palestinians (the naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of israel was dependent upon the removal of most palestinian arabs, there will be no base for a real trust. when i read the first time the list of the 383 arab villages destroyed by the state of israel in and after 1948, i got a shock. i hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution. elias davidsson iceland

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: zionism - racism diaspora 'a cancer' ------------------- by julian kossoff and lindsay schusman in: jewish chronicle, london, 22. dec. 1989 leading israeli author and cultural commentator, a.b. yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora jewry at a zionist youth council meeting in north london, last week. the diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the jewish people". he was scathing about its failure to act before the holocaust. he said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed zionism. consequently, he considered the holocaust, "the failure of judaism". his talk, entitled "diaspora: a neurotic solution", covered 5,000 years of jewish history. mr. yehoshua's other targets included soviet jews who were, he said "not staying [in israel], but running [away]", and all jews outside israel "who were using other people's countries like hotels". the only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to israel for its identity but lived elsewhere. worse, it threatened israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands. mr. yehoshua, who described himself as "a soldier for aliyah", ended by calling for the creation of a new "total jew", living in israel. earlier, speaking at a meeting of jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in israeli literature, mr. yehoshua claimed that israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation. he said israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration. today, israeli writers avoided writing directly about the arab-israeli conflict. no major work had been produced about the intifada. instead, writers were tackling themes such as jewish identity, emigration from israel and personal and family issues. mr. yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the israeli political situation. he could no longer step into an israeli arab's shoes and portray him as a real "flesh and blood character". he claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of israeli identity had not been solved. he said jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between jew and non-jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity. jewish values in israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said. he warned that modern hebrew, a unifying force for the jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. it faced fierce competition from the english language. -------------------------------------------------------------------------

"no problem, the turks will help," they say, "if we ask them, they'll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour." well that's the way it all was, but i never thought, of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. here we've been living under the soviet government for 70 years, and no one even considered such an idea possible. but i had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask, "where is this all leading, do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. the russians are fleeing sumgait, there are very few of them left. why is no one dealing with this, what's going on?" and when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag? i wouldn't be saying this now if i hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. because when we were under guard in the sk club on the 1st, he came to the club, that muslimzade. the women told me, "there he is, there he is, that's muslimzade." i didn't believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag. i thought that they were just false rumors. i went over to him and said, "are you the first secretary of our city party committee?" he answers me, "yes." and i ask him, "tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, i don't know exactly what they said, but there was mention of armenian blood?" and he tells me, "yes, i was there, but i tried to dissuade them from it." then i asked him another question: "and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us? and he said, "i. . . we didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't anticipate that that would happen in sumgait." comrade mamedov, the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr, answered the same question for me: "no, we actually didn't anticipate the slaughter in sumgait. at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in baku that was preparing for a massacre." those are his exact words, the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of the armenian ssr. and now, about the events themselves. of course it's painful to discuss them, because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. but unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of progress, i don't know, if someone had told me this story, if i were living in or around moscow, i wouldn't have believed it. why not? because it was really a genocide, it was a massacre. that's genuinely what it was. for example, on that day, the 28th--i didn't know about the 27th because my husband and i were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, "you're in bed? you don't know anything about it? there was a demonstration in town, and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them. they were looking into cars and asking, 'are you an armenian?' if they answered in armenian, then they turned the car over and burned it." this isn't made up, the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us. he was returning home from his dacha with his wife, raisa sevastyanova, she's my neighbor. she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it, i don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping. he answered in azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. we didn't even believe it, and i said, "certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?" and she said, "muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are armenians. and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, "don't break the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want. " i didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although he's an azerbaijani. while we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say, "look, there's a crowd out there." and sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building. there was an armenian family there, a woman and two girls. they lived across from us. i'm sorry, i don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my husband's apartment, in microdistrict 8, and i lived in microdistrict no. 3. there was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things were going on there then. one building there, ours, was attacked twice, once wasn't enough for them. they returned to the places where they hadn't finished the armenians off. if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians, they beat the azerbaijanis too. they also beat russians, if it was russians doing the hiding. because there were russians among them, they said so on television, there were people of various nationalities. but they didn't tell us why there were people of different nationalities. because they wouldn't have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes. at the time i saw this from the window i was there, sevastyanova was there, and so was my husband. we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. all kinds of things, even a sofa. then, when it was all down there, they burned it up. then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. at first i couldn't figure out what was happening. and later i told my husband, "lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there." and he answered, "i don't know, could be." suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and i saw it, and raisa sevastyanova saw it too. my husband had turned the other way, he didn't see it. i saw a naked girl with her hair down. they were dragging her. she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. she fell down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two from here. i know this for sure because i saw it myself. then the crowd rushed toward our building. we were standing there, and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. were they going to kill us or not? and i also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman, because i had just seen that. i asked my husband. i gave him an axe and said, "you kill me first, and then let them do what they want with the corpse." but our neighbors, it's true, defended us, they said, "there aren't any armenians in our entryway, go away, only muslims live here." disaster missed us that time. but at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, came back to our place. my husband was already asleep. he can sleep when he's upset about something, but i can't. i was standing, running from balcony to balcony. our power was out, i don't remember for how long, but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. there were no lights whatsoever, and i was glad, of course. i thought it was better that way. but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony. this was at 2:15 in the morning. the first time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the morning. but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them too. so she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. she used it as a pretext and went toward those young people. they really were youngsters. from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys. they spoke azerbaijani. and when they came up to her she said, "what do you want?" and they answered, "we want the armenian family that lives here" [pointing toward the second floor with their hands]. she says, "i already told you, we don't have any armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old muslim woman talking to you," and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. and so they seemed to listen to her. they were all very young, they started apologizing and left. that was the second time death was at our door. i forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named rubik lives there, i don't know him really, i knew his daughter, i mean i saw her around, but we really didn't know them. but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months, to earn money. can you imagine what that means? he risked his life to earn x amount of money in order to better his family. he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas, everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. they threw everything out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn't already been smashed or taken. what is one to think of that? it means that the parents in those families were in on it too. unfortunately i came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance: both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments. something on the order of "we'll move the armenians out and take over their apartments." i have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. i came as a patriot from china, waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr, i came to my homeland as a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things. but when i saw in sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that party membership was bought, that komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were no ideals, no ideas, god save me, everything was being bought and sold, i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did. i can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . when i went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under soviet army guard, they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only armenians, but some russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was. and what's interesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for the armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once i calmed down, having thought it all through, i came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. if a lot of azerbaijanis didn't want their armenian neighbors to be killed, and that basically depended on that muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute, "go and announce it on television: citizens of sumgait! take what you can into your hands, let's protect our neighbors from this massacre?" those crowds weren't such that there was no controlling them. basically they were unarmed. they didn't have firearms, mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in sumgait soils, they were brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. so as i was saying, i weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us, why wasn't it arranged? it means that the government didn't want to do it. when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik, what, there was no way of informing baku? no, there was no way, it turns out! the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. i won't mention the things i didn't see myself, i'll only talk about the things i myself witnessed. they were in microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when i saw them from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. they hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict 8. when they returned to our building i told my husband, "lendrush, now the police are probably going to come, my god, now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid." well, alas, no, there were to be no authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out, beginning on the might of the 27th. there were dead people, ruined apartments, and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in block 45! those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed soldiers, and how on that square, i can't remember the name of it, where there is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now i'm upset and i can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against that mob. and when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government? the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved. if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth, i've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad. some people there considered me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think i'm an adventure seeker, and some, a prankster. but i wanted everything to be right, i would become outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad, as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property, or the property of some magnate, or some "mafia": if i want to, i'll get you out of here; if i want to, i'll get rid of you; if i want to, i'll do something else? and there's a black market price for everything, in the most brazen way: a coach to moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so much. once when i was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, i'm afraid, i heard with my own ears: "tatyana, just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect? you're alone against everyone, so instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything will go fine for you." i started to cry, turned, and left. what else could i do, where else could i go to complain? i realized that everything was useless. and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it. i filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed it, i still have a copy, but what's the use? when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair, in addition to the information about what i saw, what i was a witness to, i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad. they accepted my petition, but i don't know if they're going to pursue it or not. because, you'll excuse me, i no longer believe in the things i aspired to, the things i believed in before: it's all dead. they just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them... i want to tell of one incident. i just don't know, at the time i was in such a state that i didn't even take minor things into account. here is an example. of course, it's not a minor one. my neighbor, raisa sevastyanova, she has a son, valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in microdistrict 8. a boy, vitaly [danielian], i don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or rather, went to school with him. i was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to moscow . . . oh yes, and there's one important detail: when the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in armenian apartments, and later, in several russian and azerbaijani apartments. but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call anywhere. why? again, it means it was all planned. how come service is cut off for no reason? and the lights went off. and those brats were raging as they liked they weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them. they knew it. now i'm going to tell about the incident. so this little vitaly, vitalik, an armenian boy, went to school with valery; they were in the same class. according to what valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time i was in the same apartment as they were, i sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through--a mob attacked the building where vitalik lived. so valery ran to his mother and said, "mamma, please let me go to vitalik's, what if they kill him? maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow. . . . he's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart." his mother wouldn't let him go. in tears, she says, "valery, you can't go because i am afraid." he says, "mamma, we can get around the crowd. we'll just watch, just have a look." they made it through. i don't know, i think vitalik's parents lived in microdistrict no. 1, and when they got there, they made a superficial deduction. knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already been murdered. little vitalik didn't even know they were dead. so two weeks ago, i don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we left sumgait on march 20, spent some time in moscow, and then we came to yerevan. so it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this straight. so valery, the next day, when he found out that vitalik's family has been killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku, valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him. but they wouldn't admit them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma. they cried and left, having also found out that the girl i saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . . when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another, throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not . . . and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! when you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end. if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. a book of things it is even difficult to believe. and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue, the ones at the sk, they know i'm not lying, that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, "what happened?" and she bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. after something like that i don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it. now . . . when we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided, well, basic conditions for us there. the military unit is located in nasosny, some six miles from sumgait. and living there we met with a larger group of people. there were about 1,600 people at the unit. you know, there was a point when i couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you. and when you hear the false rumors . . . yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armenians around yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers. i didn't know whether to believe it or not. and people who don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak, and in spitak all those villages are not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak. not a single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the armenians didn't attack anyone. but actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. and i don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty, that it is they who organized it. rumors like that are being spread in azerbaijan. and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth. for example, one says; "did you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were azerbaijani and one was an armenian?" of course i'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset. sometimes l forget things, but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee. when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i went to him to ask because i couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. i already mentioned this, and if i repeat anything, please excuse me. i asked him, "why did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor?" the overcrowding there was tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were already sick. it's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. plus they were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do. and it was only on march 8 at five o'clock in the evening that krayev himself, the lieutenant general, the city commandant of sumgait, was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart advised him, and relocate people to the military unit. but that's not what i want to talk about now. muslimzade, characteristically, tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee, which is across the square from the club. he took me by the hand and said, "citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office. i told him, "no, after everything you've done, i don't believe one iota of what you say. if i go to the city party committee i'll disappear, and the traces of me will disappear too. because you can't stand it when . . . " oh yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. it was even very funny, although at the time i wasn't up to laughing. he was in a nice, expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, i said, "oh, why did you come here all duded up like a london dandy, you smell of good perfume, you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. you came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are already getting sick, whose relatives have died. did you come to laugh at them?" and the one who was accompanying him, an azerbaijani, i don't know who he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzade's head and hid it. then i said, "my god! we're not marauders. we're not you! we didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!" "well kill me, kill me!" muslimzade says to me, "but i'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but i'm not guilty." and i say, "ok, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. but give us an answer, we're asking you: where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? where were you then?" "you know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait." i started laughing and said, "it's truly funny." he says, "what could i do? we didn't know what to do." and i say, "i'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if i tell you: the first secretary of the city party committee shouldn't march out in front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body. that's what you should have done. that's the way it was during the war. not a single party committee secretary compromised himself; either he died or he led people into battle. and what did you do? you ran away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. and when we ask you, you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? that's right," i told him, "the city party committee got confused, all the party committees got confused, the police got confused,. baku got confused, they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with impunity. and if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two days, there wouldn't be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure, they would have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told them, 'as soon as we finish with the armenians we'll come after you, too." and by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. he was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. we asked him, "what? how? what will come of us?" he openly said, "you know, for us the main thing now is to catch that gang. we'll finish that quickly. you'll stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later." the general procuracy of the ussr arrived, it consists of investigators from all cities. there were some from stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because the affair was truly frightful. about this, by the way, comrade katusev spoke; as everyone knows, he's the first deputy general procurator of the ussr. when he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, and he said, "there was afghanistan; and it was bad, but sumgait--it's horrible! and the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished, in accordance with our laws." and that's a quote. then one mother throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says, "who will return my sons? who is going to punish the [culprits]?" they tried to calm her down, and he said, "in order for us to conduct a proper investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe someone saw something. don't be afraid, write about it in detail. so that you're not afraid . . . everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge later. we're going to do it like this: we're going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there. we don't need to know who wrote it. the names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the information. let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians . . . you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn." two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. and, sure enough, many people, people who didn't even want to write . . .i know one woman who asked me, she came up and said, "you, as a russian, the same thing won't happen to you as will happen to me. so please . . . i'll give you the information, and you please write it down for me." so she was afraid, and there were a lot like her . . . but later, after katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down everything she knew. and we threw it all into the urn. now we don't know if it will be of any use. for a factual picture will emerge from all that information. one person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply can't lie. you have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. why, for example, should someone say that black is white if it is really black? the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr, mamedov, as i said, was in yerevan. my husband and i were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present, the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings, to their old apartments. we asked for a meeting with him, and it was granted. when we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade, "where were you personally when they were beating us? now you're trying to convince us to return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading?" he says, "you're telling the truth. let's not mince words. you've told me right to my face, and i'll tell you straight. i'll tell you the pure truth. i was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 45,000 in baku. but we never expected that in a city like sumgait, with its fine international record, such a thing could happen. we expected it in baku." i say, "so that means you expected it all the same? why were you expecting it?" and he says, "you know, it just happened that way. we were expecting it in baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in sumgait . . . " i say, "fine, you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have known. why did no one help us?" and he says, "well, ok, we didn't know what to do" and things like that. basically it was the same story i got from muslimzade. later, when he said, "you go on back, the situation in sumgait is favorable now, everything is fine, the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis . . . " to this l answered, "you know what . . . i'm speaking with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an eyewitness . . . you tell me, please, comrade mamedov, " i asked him, "what would you say about this honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?" then he said, "yes, i admit that i am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire azerbaijani nation, we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire soviet union, but before the whole world. because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too." and i say, "there's nothing to add to what really happened. i don't think it's possible to add anything more awful." he says, "yes, i agree with you, i understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence." i repeat that he said "unfortunate occurrence." and then he suddenly remembered himself, what he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously-- and said, "oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . " i take this to mean that he really thinks it's an "unfortunate occurrence." "and of course," he says, "i understand that having gone through all this you can't return to sumgait, but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried." and he even gave a detail, which, i don't know if it matters or not, that 160 policemen were being tried. specifically in relation to that bloody affair. yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how i was set up at work in baku after the events. i went to an undergarment plant, there was an azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, "what, they didn't nail your husband? they screwed up." i was floored, i hadn't imagined that anyone in baku, too, could say something like that. well after that i went up to see . . . to my office, i needed to find out about those days, what was going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from february 29 to march 10 . . . and the administrator told me, "i don't know, tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. be grateful if they don't put it down as unexcused absence." i was really discouraged by this. they all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here they're telling me that i was skipping work, as though i was off enjoying myself somewhere. i went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name is rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. incidentally, he's a party member, and is a big man in town. and suddenly, when i went to him and said, "comrade rasulov, this is the way it was . . . " he looked at me askance and said, "and why are you"--he knows me by my previous last name--"why did you get wrapped up in this mess?" i say, "what do you mean, why did i get wrapped up in this mess? my husband's an armenian," i tell him, "i have an armenian last name." and he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as though he had eaten something sour, and said, "i didn't expect that you would . . . " what did he mean by that? and "how" should he behave, the chief of the pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? now, it's true, there was a reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?! he's going to believe any and all rumors, that the armenians are like this, the armenians are like that, and so on . . . by the way, that mamedov--now i'm going back to mamedov's office when i asked him "are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to sumgait?" he answered, "yes, you know, i would guarantee them . . . i don't want to take on too much, i would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. but i won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years." i say, "so you've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from now? so they'll be quiet and then in another 50 years it'll happen again?!" i couldn't contain myself any more, and i also told him, "and how did it get to that point, certainly you knew about it, how they were treating the russians, for example, in baku and in sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? certainly you received complaints, i wrote some myself. why did no one respond to them? why did everyone ignore what was going on? didn't you prepare people for this by the way you treated them?" and he says, "you know, you're finally starting to insult me!" he threw his pen on the desk. "maybe now you'll say i'm a scoundrel too?" i say, "you know, i'm not talking about you because i don't know. but about the ones who i do know i can say with conviction, yes, that comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because i know for certain. "well anyway he assured us that here, in yerevan, there were false rumors, that 3,000 sumgait armenians were here, and 15,000 were in sumgait and had gotten back to work. everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. "we drove about the town ourselves, comrade arutiunian [first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr] came from the council of ministers of armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in sumgait." when i asked mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, ' "well, i walked down the street." and i said, "walking down the street in any city, even if i were to go to new york, i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest, i don't have any contact with people, but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't know you were the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers, you'd hear something quite different." i told him, for example, that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. they took us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. how are the neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? i thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some anti-national something. and when that bus took us to our building, because it was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier accompanied us. what does that say? it speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us, going from apartment to apartment? and in fact, especially with the young people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they were making comments, too. and that was in the presence of troops, when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by. and if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether? there will be more outrages, of course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . . april 20, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 166-177 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "how do we explain turkish troops on s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | the armenian border, when we can't p.o. box 382761 | even explain 1915?" cambridge, ma 02238 | turkish mp, march 1992

from: _quantum_ magazine, march/april 1993 pages 42-46 	the problem book of anania of shirak 	------------------------------------ 		"on the ancient peak of ararat 		the centuries have come like seconds 		and passed on." 				-avetik issahakian by yuri danilov some years ago journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: "what books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?" and though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems. some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for "numbers" (though secretly afraid of them). others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. professional mathematicians were no exception. here's what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: "i willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes i failed completely. of course, like most of my friends, i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. but we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . by the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, i must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. it seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers." now, i'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. but a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to venus and back. 			one for the "road" 	they both took out the books they brought for the road. kingsley 	glanced at the royal astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with 	a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. "god 	knows what this kind of stuff leads to," thought kingsley. 	the royal astronomer looked at kingsley's book and saw the history 	of herodotus. "good lord, next he'll be reading thucydides," thought 	the royal astronomer. 					--fred hoyle, the black cloud the book i'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century armenia. naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of armenian architecture, the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van (in what is now turkey_. they are as inseparable from the image of armenia as the elegant letters of the armenian alphabet, invented by mesrop mashtots, or the songs of komitas, or the paintings of saryan. an edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. it was published under the title problems and solutions of vardapet [1] anania of shirak, armenian mathematician of the seventh century (translated and published by i. a. orbeli, petrograd, 1918). the abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when anania of shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. for many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. even now, after research by k. p. patkanov, the learned monk father kaloust, j.i. orbeli, a. abramyan, v. k. chaloyan, and others has brought the works of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book. 		vardapet anania of shirak 	once fell in love with the art of calculation, i thought that no 	philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering 	it the mother of all wisdom. 					--anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinkers, vardapet anania of shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. some of his works have been preserved. in addition to the problems and solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: on weights and measures, cosmography and calendrical theory, and armenian geography of the seventh century a.d. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia, movses of khoren). in his autobiography, anania of shirak has this to say about himself: 	i, anania of shirak, having studied all the science of our 	armenian land and having learned the holy scripture intimately, 	in the expression of the psalmist, "every day i illuminated the 	eyes of my mind." feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation, 	i came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, 	the mother of all sciences, without number. i could find in armenia 	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the 	sciences. i therefore went to greece and met in theodosiople a man 	named iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. he told me 	that in forth armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician, 	christosatur. i went this person and spent six months with him. but soon i noticed that christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts. 	i then went to constantinople, where i met acquaintances who told me: 	"why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in trebizon, on the 	coast of pontus [3] lives the byzantine vardapet tyukhik. he is full 	of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows armenian literature." i asked 	them how they knew this. they answered: "we saw ourselves that many 	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. 	indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople, 	philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become 	pupils of tyukhik." when i heard this, i expressed my gratitude to 	god, who had quenched the thirst of his slave. 	i went to tyukhik at the monastery of st. eugene and explained why i 	had come. he received me graciously and said: "i praise our lord that 	he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st. 	gregory; i am glad that all your country will learn from me. i myself 	lived in armenia for many years as a youth. ignorance reigned there." 	vardapet tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with 	me. the lord bestowed upon me his blessing: i completely assimilated 	the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students 	at the king's court began to envy me. 	i spent eight years with tyukhik and studied many books that had not 	been translated into our language. for the vardapet had an innumerable 	collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, 	books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. why 	enumerate them by title? in a word, there is no book that tyukhik did 	not have. and he had such a gift from the holy spirit for translating 	that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into 	armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the 	translation read as if the work were written in that language 	originally. 	tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had 	learned the armenian language. "when i was young," he said, "i lived 	in trebizon, at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus, and 	for a long time, up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i 	served as a military man in armenia and learned your language and 	literature. during one attack by persian troops on the greeks, i was 	wounded and escaped to antioch. i lost all my possessions. praying to 	the lord to heal my wounds, i made a promise: "if you prolong my life, 	i shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to 	collecting treasures of knowledge." and the lord heard my prayers. 	after i recovered i went to jerusalem, and from there to alexandria 	and rome. upon returning to constantinople, i met a famous philosopher 	from athens and studied with him for many years. after that i returned 	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people." 	after some years that philosopher died. not finding a replacement for 	him, the king and his courtiers sent for tyukhik and invited him to 	assume the teacher's position. tyukhik, citing the promise he made to 	god not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. but because 	of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study 	with him. 	and i, the most insignificant of all armenians, having learned from 	him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our 	country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, god's 	help, and the prayers of the blessed educator. and no one thanked me 	for my efforts. 				problems and solutions 	a half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed 	on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; 	one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and 	forty-five inscribed copies--on dutch paper. and so, find how many 	copies were printed in all. 					--imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ("books have their own fate"). the fate of problems and solutions by anania of shirak is quite amazing. the manuscripts of anania's book were preserved only because, according to armenian historians, "in ancient and medieval armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children." biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscripts). and its hour finally arrived. in 1896 the learned monk father kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. in 1918 the book was translated into russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by iosef orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the academy of sciences of the ussr). in the translator's words, the problems of anania are "amusing, full of life, and simple." orbeli goes on to say: "the subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. the scene is predominantly his homeland shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the kamsarakans, including nersekh, who was a contemporary of anania." like other ancient authors, anania of shirak used only "aliquots" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. when it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above). like any true work of art, the problems of anania suffer terribly in the retelling. you have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. so let's open anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages. problems 1 and 8 relate to the armenian uprising against the persians in a.d. 572. problem 1 my father told me the following story. during the famous wars between the armenians and the persians, prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops. the first time, he struck down half of the persian army. the second time, pursuing the persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. the third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army. the persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to nakhichevan. and so, from this remainder, find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre. problem 8 during the famous armenian uprising against the persians, when zaurak kamsarakan killed suren, one of the armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news. the envoy covered fifty miles in a day. fifteen days later, when he learned of this, zaurak kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. the riders covered eighty miles in a day. and so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy. problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. in the russian translation, they are all called "dishes." but in the original armenian, according to orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. scutel is a common armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in armenian literature before anania's problems and solutions. problem 18 there was a tray in my house. i melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. from one third i made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, i made a bowl. and now, find the weight of the tray. several of the problems reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in anania's time -- for instance, problem 7. problem 7 once i was in marmet, the capital of the kamsarakans. strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan, i saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. we caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. when i looked in the creel, i found forty-five fishes. and now, find how many fishes here were in all. the temptation is great to present all 24 problems. but i'll restrain myself and offer you just one more. problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. the wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the armenian lands. yet anania of shirak offers evidence to the contrary . problem 20 the hunting preserve of nersekh kamsarakan, ter[5] of shirak and asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called artin. one night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. the hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of talin, told nersekh about them. when he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. the young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. and so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre. 		"set in type by me, iosef orbeli" 	his biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a 	bibliography. 				-- k uzbashyan, academician 					iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the russian translation of anania of shirak's problems and solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. and this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. an advertisement at the end of the book reads: "this book was typeset in december 1917 at the printing offices of the russian academy of sciences by me, iosef orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by m. strolman." typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli, who later became the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad. he was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house typis academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. in preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of armenian churches, orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. this complicated work was done by m. g. strolman. (unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of leningrad in world war ii.) when orbeli came to the printing offices of the academy of sciences, times were hard. the only way to publish the newly translated problems of anania was for orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). in 1922 orbeli became the director of printing at the academy of sciences. even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of russian academic typography. 			back to earth 	this book by definition does not exhaust all the most important 	works in this domain. the editor hopes that those who are guilty 	of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, 	will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph. 			--v. bonch-bruyevich introduction to the 			russian translation of solid-body 			symmetry by r. knox and a. gold let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the perelman crater on the far side of the moon. maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: "this anania from shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. when i get home i'll try to find his problems." good luck, my young friend! anania is sure to entertain you. perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless problems and solutions. and we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by iosef orbeli. [1] vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in armenian.

the latest israeli "proposal", first proposed in february of 1992, contains the following assumptions concerning the nature of any "interim status" refering to the wb and gaza, the palestinians, implemented by negotiations. it states that: >israel will remain the existing source of authority until "final status" is agreed upon; >israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the interim self-government arrangements (isga); >the isga will apply to the "palestinian inhabitants of the territories" under israeli military administration. the arrangements will not have a territorial application, nor will they apply to the israeli population of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem; >residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel; >israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd; >israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order; >the organs of the isga will be of an administrative-functional nature; >the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and coordination with israel. >israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education, business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police, local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious affairs. several question do come to mind concerning the "success" we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process. these arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any palestinian "interim" self-control. without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability, can israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the negotiating process) more "relaxed" proposals for this"interim" period? how should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their "maximalist" approaches as stated above? how can israeli worries ,and desire for some "interim control", be addressed while providing for a very *real* interim palestinian self-governing entity? tim >later comment: > >there seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. the >first is that of israel, where there is little trust for arab groups, so >there is little support for israel giving up **tangible** assets in >exchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. the second >is that of the arab world/palestinians, where there is the demand that >these "tangible concessions" be made by israel **without** it receiving >anything **tangible** back. given this, the gap between the two stances >seems to be the need by israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns >for its expected concessions. by "tangible" is meant something that >1) provides israel with "comparable" protection (from the land it is to >give up), 2) in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine >**will be** accountable and held actively (not just "diplomatically) >responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens >or "visitors"). > >israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute >it lets go (gives lands back to arab states, no more "buffer zone", gives >full autonomy to palestinians), any and/or all of the arab parties >could (and *would*, if not "controlled" somehow) easily return to the >traditional anti-israel position. the question then is how to *really* >ensure that that will not happen. -- ______________________________________________________________________________ tim clock ph.d./graduate student uci tel#: 714,8565361 department of politics and society fax#: 714,8568441 university of california - irvine

instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. i am positive that muslimzade did that. no one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that we were there. in any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid. in the morning we went to my relative's in microdistrict 1, and the soldiers took us to the sk club from there. the club was jammed with people, and there were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. one small boy, about three months old, died right in my arms. there wasn't a single doctor, nothing. the boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. he was just very ill. they gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. and his mother and father, a young armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ... i searched for a spot for us in the sk, we have a small child of our own, i wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. i went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, with their heads broken open. they were a terrible sight. young guys, all of them. there were a lot of bandaged armenians, too. everyone had been beaten, everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. i think that the city party committee ignored us completely. true, there was a snack bar: a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . but there was no way to get the things any cheaper. i met my old uncle, aram mikhailovich, there. he saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. my whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we worked together, he always had azerbaijanis over at his house. and now he saw me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. you can understand his feelings, of course. april 8, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 185-186 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal

andy beyer has claimed that the israeli press is a bit biased. but the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the mideast that people who do not read the israeli press simply know nothing about. many of these events are not even mentioned here. i read the israeli press to learn of important events about which you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media for your information on israel. since i read both american media and israeli media, i can say with absolute certainty that anybody who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about israel does not have a true picture of what is going on. as to the claim that israeli papers are biased, of course they are. some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media here in america. but they still report events about which people here know nothing. i choose to form my opinions about israel and the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.
anas omran has claimed that, "the israelis used to arrest, and sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters." the assertion by anas omran is, of course, a total fabrication. if there is an once of truth iin it, i'm sure anas omran can document such a sad and despicable event. otherwise we may assume that it is another piece of anti-israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does not know how to teach their children to tell the truth. if omran would care to retract this 'error' i would be glad to retract the accusation that he is a liar. if he can document such a claim, i would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar. failing to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.

the fact that israel is already discussing with some palestinians what the composition of the armed palestinian police force in the territories will be during the transition phase indicates some real solid concessions and liberal thinking on the part of the israeli side. -- chris metcalfe

"your three chiefs, dro, hamazasp and kulkhandanian are the ringleaders of the bands which have destroyed tartar villages and have staged massacres in zangezour, surmali, etchmiadzin, and zangibasar. this is intolerable. look - and here he pointed to a file of official documents on the table - look at this, here in december are the reports of the last few months concerning ruined tartar villages which my representative wardrop has sent me. the official tartar communique speaks of the destruction of 300 villages." p. 54 (fifth paragraph). "yes, of course. i repeat, until this massacre of the tartars is stopped and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership i hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition."

referring to notes from the personal diary of russian general l. odishe liyetze on the turkish front, he wrote, "on the nights 11-12 march, 1918 alone armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death 3000 muslims in areas surrounding erzincan. these barbars threw their victims into pits, most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish muslims, in groups of 80. my adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. this is an act against our world of civilization." on march 12, 1918 lieut-colonel griyaznof wrote (from an official russian account of the turkish genocide), "roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos, dismembered joints and carved out organs of muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children." source: doc. dr. azmi suslu, "russian view on the atrocities committed by the armenians against the turks," ankara universitesi, ankara, 1987, pp. 45-53. "document no: 77," archive no: 1-2, cabin no: 10, drawer no: 4, file no: 410, section no: 1578, contents no: 1-12, 1-18. (acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war, lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov) "the things i have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of erzurum by the turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the armenians. during the russian occupation of erzurum, no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. while the commander of the first army corps, general kaltiyin remained in power, troops including armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. when the security measures were lifted, the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings. following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. one day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. the roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt... it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. finally, the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. the incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. sometime in january and february, a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum, was killed one night at his home. the commander in chief (odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...we learnt the details this incident from the commander-in-chief, odishelidge. they were as follows: the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades... more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan. large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. later, the murdered turks were thrown into the holes. the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks, and cut their heads off one by one. following the erzincan massacre, the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum... the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. during the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. while the travellers were passing through erzurum, the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired. when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds, they attempted to help them. however, the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows: an armenian had shot a kurd. the kurd fell down but did not die. the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd. however, since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the armenian failed in his attempt. having seen this, the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed. their heads had been cut off by axes. he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. lieutenant colonel gryaznov, who passed through the village of ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. every armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters. among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. the women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. the genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. a few educated armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done. to the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. when he told the girls that the armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february 20: the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall. they had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. the great massacre in erzurum began on february 7... the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. the others, the armenians claimed, were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on. among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers, karagodaviev. today, some turks were murdered on the streets. on february 12, some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems. the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk. when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk?' in erzurum, the armenians burned down the turkish market. on february 17, i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. on the same day when antranik entered erzurum, i reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. however no result was achieved. in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. on the night of 26/27 february, the armenians deceived the russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers. later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. however, the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders. i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. no, for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. however, such people were only a minority. furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause. some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. there were certain others, who, when accused by the russians of infamy, would say the following: 'you are russians. you can never understand the armenian cause.' the armenians had a conscience. they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldiers." serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape

today marks the 78th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds in eastern anatolia and x-soviet armenia. the following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to president bill clinton, members of congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/tv stations for the 78th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 2.5 million muslim people. on april 23 of every year, the people of turkiye remember their dead. they grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. this year the turkish nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the turkish land happily and prosperously. ------------------------- letter ---------------------------------- during the years of world war i, the x-soviet armenian government has planned and perpetrated the 'genocide' of the muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the turkish homeland of its inhabitants. to this day, turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-soviet armenia. in order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic turkish homeland, which is the crux of turkish political demands, fascist x-soviet armenia continues its anti-turkish policy in the following ways: 1. x-soviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility. 2. x-soviet armenia, employing asala/sdpa/arf terrorism and revisionism triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the turkish genocide. 3. x-soviet armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the asala/sdpa/arf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to silence the turkish people's vehement demands and protests. 4. using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-soviet armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-turkish supporters of the turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian. using all the aforementioned methods, the x-soviet armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the turkish case a contemporary issue. yet despite the efforts of the x-soviet armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the turkish genocide. with the full knowledge that the struggle for the turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the turkish and kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the turkish genocide demand: 1. that the x-soviet armenian government, as the heirs of the armenian dictatorship, recognize the turkish genocide; 2. that x-soviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and kurdish people; 3. that the x-soviet armenian government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide; 4. that all world governments, and especially the united states, officially recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all armenian political pressure; 5. that the u.s. government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-soviet armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-soviet republics officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million muslim people in their history books. the awareness of the turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the turkish cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the turkish cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. therefore, the victims of the turkish genocide call upon all muslims in the united states and canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 2.5 million muslim people. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

(pro israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by bnai brith) what hamas and islamic jihad believe in, as far as i can get from the arab media, is an islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under koranic law. this would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the jews in palestine took control of the land and its (mostly muslim) inhabitants. however, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. the political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice. as for the plo, i am at a loss to explain what is going inside arafat's mind. although their political thinking seems far fetched with israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the islamic movements are using the same weapon the jews used to establish their state : religion. ahmed. forget the syntax, ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. the fact is that the plo does not recognize israel's right to exist. this is perfectly obvious from the plo covenant (cairo, 1968). the covenant calls for the destruction of the "zionist entity". as far as i know the israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the plo. if you would like, i can post the relevant caluses. now the hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. i know it has been posted here several times, and while i do not have a copy of it, i am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it. regardless of phrasing, groups like hamas, and the hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct plo, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of israel. it just seems to me that mr. davidsson's suggestion that jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many jews. harry.

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: rejoinder. questions to israelis to: shaig@think.com subject: ten questions to israelis dear shai, your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory. in the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis: citizenship (ezrahut) and nationality (le'um). the former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in israeli society. i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. these id cards make clear who the holder is, a jew or an arab. you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. but do you really believe that this is the reason ? could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ? in the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders, you state that israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. according to what i read, the first zionists in the beginning of the century, had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan (jordan). i also read that it was the express wish of ben-gurion to not declare israel's borders, when israel was established, as this might restrict israel's opportunities for later expansion. israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there 2000 years ago or that god promised the land to them. but according to biblical sources, the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq. and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today ? finally, if israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982). your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official. i don't think your answer is honest. you refer me to vanunu's revelations about israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? i would appreciate more honesty. somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in israeli prisons. he posted an article from ma'ariv documenting such cases. it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel. what do you think about that ? you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon israel'. such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents: they call the soviet union into disrepute. if my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. this is a sign of weakness, not of strength. i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.
from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: rejoinder. questions to israelis dear josh i appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions. having said that, i am not totally happy with your answers. 1. you did not fully answer my question whether israeli id cards identify the holders as jews or arabs. you imply that u.s. citizens must identify themselves by race. is that true ? or are just trying to mislead the reader ? do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ? 2. the answer to the second question is evasive. there are all kinds of maps issued. they are not equivalent to state policy. you did not respond to my question. 3. your answer to the third question (israeli nuclear arsenal) is interesting. you say that israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear weapons. what evidence have you for maintaining that ? 4. my fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a ma'ariv article documenting such cases. i did not ask about cases like vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned. 5. thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. from it i understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law). the law allows israeli arabs to settle in hebron, it seems. if so, why doesn't it allow hebron arabs to settle in israel ? 6. your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what i was told, namely that hundreds of thousands of non-jews who left for some reason or other the area under israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not jews. jews who also left, for example to europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to return. how can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ? is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ? 7. somebody answered my 7.question regarding y. rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. according to that information, y. rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of lydda and ramleh, about 50,000 people. these expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind bosnia. i was referred to a book by israeli journalist benny goodman called the origin of the palestinian refugee problem, published by cambridge university press. is this book available in your library ? 8. you maintain that there are some israeli arabs living in israeli kibbutzim. i wonder how many and where. there is very little evidence available about that. as much as i know, many arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are not accepted as members. could it be that kibbutzim do not want arabs ? 9. my question about the lack of civil marriage in israel was whether it is true that the israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage. you did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way'. i am certain that if only religious communities in the u.s. would be asked, they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages. but israel has always been ruled by a secular majority. your answer is not satisfactory. i would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments. elias

although i realize that principle is not one of your strongest points, i would still like to know why do do not ask any question of this sort about the arab countries. if you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your fixation on israel must stop. you might have to start asking the same sort of questions of arab countries as well. you realize it would not work, as the arab countries' treatment of jews over the last several decades is so bad that your fixation on israel would begin to look like the biased attack that it is. everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'center for policy research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot who hates israel. why don't you try being honest about your hatred of israel? i have heard that your family once lived in israel, but the members of your family could not cut the competition there. is this true about your family? is this true about you? is this actually not about israel, but is really a personal vendetta? why are you not the least bit objective about israel? do you think that the name of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least? get a clue, mr. davidsson. haven't you realized yet that when you post such stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from people who are armed with the truth? haven't you realized that a piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a truth? haven't you realized that you are in over your head? the people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or need them to be. this is not the place for such pseudo-analysis. you will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show some regard for objectivity. or you can continue to show what an anti-israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a pompous name like the 'center for policy research.' you ought to know that you are a laughing stock, your 'center' is considered a joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns, bigots, and idiots of usenet.

|> could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it |> serves no other purpose ? a number of points. you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used. true, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them. for citizens, the standard id is the id card. the purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer. this takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... quite frankly, it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week. there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public. furthermore, none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information. the only case that i can think of in which the le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario. in general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially. |> in the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that |> israel has no fixed borders, you state that israel's borders were |> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. according to what i |> read, the first zionists in the beginning of the century, had |> plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into |> transjordan (jordan). i also read that it was the express wish of |> ben-gurion to not declare israel's borders, when israel was |> established, as this might restrict israel's opportunities for |> later expansion. israel often claims it right of existence on the |> fact that jews lived there 2000 years ago or that god promised the |> land to them. but according to biblical sources, the area god |> promised would extend all the way to iraq. and what were the |> borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use |> today ?

i would appreciate more honesty. your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a "center for policy research". whether or not all of vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were. for disclosing "state secrets" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. as to which were and which weren't, i am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. he was taken to court, tried, and found guilty. you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of "secrets of state", something which every democratic govt has. |> somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning |> 'hidden prisoners' in israeli prisons. he posted an article from |> ma'ariv documenting such cases. it seems that such prisoners do |> exist in israel. what do you think about that ? i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist. the clu noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases. i am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it. my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours. this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation. |> you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a |> way to 'cast aspersions upon israel'. such terms have often been |> used by the soviet union against dissidents: they call the soviet |> union into disrepute. if my questions are not disturbing, they |> would not call forth such hysterical answers. my questions are |> clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. i would be |> very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about |> israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. |> i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest |> discussion. this is a sign of weakness, not of strength. well, i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted. such questions are often termed "tabloid journalism" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then. to use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture. my answers were not any more "hysterical" than the questions themselves. the problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking. you fall into the same category of those who seek "yes" "no" answers when the real answer is "of sorts". i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit. a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect. the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness. |> i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth. ditto. -- shai guday | stealth bombers, os software engineer | thinking machines corp. |	the winged ninja of the skies. cambridge, ma |

'poly's audience is mostly made of greeks who are not allowed to listen to turkish news. however, in today's informed world greek propagandists can only fool themselves. for instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the tv news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the american newspapers of july and august 1974 to find out what really happened. there are in turkiye the greek hospital, the greek girls' lycee alumni association, the principo islands greek benevolent society, the greek medical foundation, the principo greek orphanage foundation, the yovakimion greek girls' lycee foundation, and the fener greek men's lycee foundation. as for greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers' association, the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace. such community associations had been active until 1984. but they were first told to remove the word 'turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. this is also the final verdict (november 4, 1987) of the greek high court. in the city of komotini, a former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of turkish descent. this duly-elected ethnic turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle, used by the greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of turkiye. the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term 'turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'muslims.' the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority. the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people, whom all the three nations (bulgarians, turks, and greeks) consider as part of themselves. do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? poor 'poly.' it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority. they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece. talk about oppression. in addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' greek parliament passed law no. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. they have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. talk about fascism. the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the turkish minority, as state official. although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece, the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. talk about democracy. the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini. such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the 'so-called' greek constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. the government of greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region. and you pondered. sidiropoulos, the president of the macedonian human rights committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the macedonian minority. a forestry official by occupation, sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina. his employer, the florina city council, asked him to depart in 24 hours. the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in copenhagen. he returned to florina by his own choice and remains without a job. helsinki watch, a well-known human rights group, had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece. in august 1990, their findings were published in a report titled 'destroying ethnic identity: turks of greece.' the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities. it says for instance, the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini. such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the lausanne convention. the turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. the cemetery in karotas was razed by bulldozers. shall i go on? why not? the people of turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the greek government. the discussion of human rights violations in greece does not stop at the greek frontier. in several following articles i shall dwell on and expose the greek treatment of turks in western thrace and the aegean macedonians. it has been reported that the greek cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in europe. meanwhile, greek and greek cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in europe. an acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. but we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. the rugs at the amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. shots were fired on the mosque in the village of aryana. now wait, there is more.

"if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no eastern problem. but turks did not do so. they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody "to worship in their own way" centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum. thus, in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. and the barbarian (!) turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians, could find asylum. these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries."[1] "the turks, who are a conquering nation, did not turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule. because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today" (popescu ciocanel).

(a. de mortraye).[3] "turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. on the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism. if you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians, especially that of the orthodoxes. no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens, even today. in turkey, however, if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection." "in that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. because of this, the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon. in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. while the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns. when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of priests."

forgotten. on the contrary, some of the moments become even sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . they say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened. nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian: those who lost someone and those who didn't. that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you could already smell danger in the air. but we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. at least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. my parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. but then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us. in our apartment the tragedy started on february 28, around five in the afternoon. i call it a tragedy, and i repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among armenians, among people who wish me only well, i feel like it's all starting over again. i remember how that mob broke into our apartment . . . my parents were standing in the hall. my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. we're known as a hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis, jews, or russians. we had friends of many nationalities, even a turkmen woman. my parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. i remember him telling my mother, "run to the kitchen for a knife." but mother was detached, pale, as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. to be honest i never expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. a girlfriend was at the house that day, a russian girl, lyuda, and mamma said, "no matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out of the bedroom. we're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment." we went into the bedroom. there were four of us. marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another. the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me. i'm an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately. i wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. and maybe karina was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. we didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout. there was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. i couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom. i ran after her, i had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately. the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me, at least so as to save marina and her friend. the mob was shouting, all of their eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. at first about 40 people burst in, but later i was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. they came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other room. he didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said, "tell them not to touch the children. tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children." she said this to father in armenian. there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in. they understood armenian perfectly. the local azerbaijanis don't know armenian, they don't need to speak it. and one of them responded in armenian: "you and your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan. they killed our women, our girls, our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ," and so on and so forth, "and we came to do the same thing to you." this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. they were mostly young people, under 30. at first there weren't any older people among them. and all of their faces were unfamiliar. sumgait is a small town, all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, i'm a teacher. so they dragged my father into the other room. they twisted his arms and took him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. they closed the door to that room all but a crack. we couldn't see what was happening to father, what they were doing to him. then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off mamma's sarafan, and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani: "i'm old enough to be your mother! what are you doing?!" he struck her. now he's being held, mamma identified him. i hope he's convicted. then they went after karina, who's been talking to them like a komsomol leader, as though she were trying to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their consciousness. she told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they mustn't do it. she said, "come on, let's straighten this out, without emotions. what do you want? who are you? why did you come here? what did we ever do to you?" someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and coming--said, "what are you talking to, them for. you should kill them. we came here to kill them." they pushed karina, struck her, and she fell down. they beat her, but she didn't cry out. even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, "what did we do to you? what did we do to you?" and even later, when she came to, she said, "mamma, what did we do to them? why did they do that to us?" that group was prepared, i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. i remember that when they were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina. all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. that's why i felt no pain. later, when they carried karina off, they beat her savagely . . . it's really amazing that she not only lived, but didn't lose her mind . she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty. mostly they beat her face, with their fists, kicking her, using anything they could find. mamma, karina, and i were all in one room. and again i didn't feel any pain, just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they did. then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room. then someone suggested, "let's take her outside." those beasts were in heaven. they did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the authorities. those were their true colors. at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them. when they carried karina out and beat mamma-her face was completely covered with blood--that's when i started to feel the pain. i blacked out several times from the pain, but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film. i think i'm a kind person by nature, but i'm vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and i don't deserve it. i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, i'd remember them, and i'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me "forget," you have to forget, you have to go on living. at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something, and despite the fact that i hurt all over--i had been beaten terribly--i found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. i realized that i had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end. i pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. i remember now that he's being held, too. as though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. i had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, i was up in the air. as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, i suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. and suddenly i felt myself flying. i couldn't figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it. when i came to i thought now i'm going to smash on the ground. and when it didn't happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor. and since i didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. they started to trample me with their feet. shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. then i lost consciousness. i came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment i didn't need any of those things. i was sure that none of us would survive, and i had even forgotten about marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth living. there was a moment when the pain was especially great. i withstood inhuman pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious. i started to strangle myself, and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well, because he was the oldest in the group. he looked around 48. i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, one who would never do such a thing. something came over him then, you see, even during the investigation he almost called me "daughter," he apologized, although, of course, he knew that i'd never forgive him. something like that i can never forgive. i have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my words, or with my deeds, i have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. i shall never forget it. i wanted to do myself in then, because i had nothing to lose, because no one could protect me. my father, who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive. and ira melkumian, my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to kill her, his very own sister. he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering. when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. i don't know which one it was, edik or igor. both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown. but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait. i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians' landing. his name is makhaddin, he knows my family a little. he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. he's a good person. he said, "you should praise god that you all survived. but what i saw with my own eyes, i, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, i," he says, "nearly lost my mind that day. i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again." the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything. one of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment. igor, edik, and ira remained. he saw ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. he told us about it and said he would never forget it. he heard the brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that they were powerless to do anything. but all the same they tried to do something. the guy who got hit with the axe lived. i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom. i was in such a state that i couldn't even remember my sister's name. i wanted to cry "marina!" out to her, but could not. i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. and thus i saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't armenians. lyuda's a russian, you can tell right away, and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani. and i almost gave her away and doomed her. i'm glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . although her spirit was murdered . . . at some point i came to and saw igor, igor agayev, my acquaintance, in that mob. he lives in the neighboring building. for some reason i remembered his name, maybe i sensed my defense in him. i called out to him in russian, "igor, help!" but he turned away and went into the bedroom. just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom. igor said he knew marina and lyuda, that marina in fact was azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the neighbors. and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment, something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me. then they were striking me very hard--we have an indian vase, a metal one, they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked out--they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. they were already sure that i was dead because i didn't react at all to the new blows. someone said, "she's already dead, let's throw her out." when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when i was about to die the second time, i heard someone say in azerbaijani: "don't kill her, i know her, she's a teacher." i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but i can't remember whose voice it was. it wasn't igor, because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent: his mother is russian and they speak russian at home. he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does. i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	i having opened my eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. i had been beaten so much that i didn't have the strength to remember him. i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position. unfortunately i can't remember anything more. what should i say about igor? he didn't treat me badly. i had heard a lot about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan. he knew that women usually like bravery in a man. especially if a man was in afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. later i found out that he had served in ufa, and was injured, but that's not in afghanistan, of course. i found that all out later. among the people who were in our apartment, my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization. i don't know his last name, his first name is najaf, he is an armenian-born azerbaijani. but later karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she didn't want to endanger him. she said, "he was there," and a little while later, "maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else. no, it seems like it was he." i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something entirely different. the investigators haven't summoned him yet. he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. he brought groceries and flowers, this was right before march 8th; he almost started crying, he was so upset to see our condition. i don't know if he was putting us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy, he said that he had been in baku, he wasn't in sumgait. the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. i don't know how the investigators are now treating him. at one point i wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. couldn't he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi? i'm not ruling out that possibility. ill now return to our apartment. mamma had come to. you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married: her wedding band and her watch were gold. she bought her own and her husband's lives with them. she gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. vadim vorobyev. a russian boy, he speaks azerbaijani perfectly. he's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street. he goes to a special school, one for mentally handicapped children. but i'll say this--i'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. he's healthy, he can think just fine, and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. and he's cunning, too. after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album. he beat mamma and demanded gold, saying, "lady, if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we'll let you live." and mamma told them where the gold was. he brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another. i'm surprised they didn't kill one another right then. mamma was still in control of herself. she had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she ran into the other room. father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. there was a broken table on top of the pil- low. mamma grabbed father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, halfway into the other world. he couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, and was covered with black and blue. mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, it was some sort of cloth, i think it was a slipcover from an armchair. the bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room mamma pulled father out of, led him out of, carried him out of. we had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. three people were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. she said, "i was afraid to turn around, i just seized father and started pulling him, but at the threshold i couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'." mamma remembered one of the criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, out of one eye. she says, "i realized that my death would come from that person. i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing." later they caught that scoundrel. meanwhile, mamma grabbed father and left. i was alone. igor had taken marina away, mamma and father were gone, karina was already outside, i didn't know what they were doing to her. i was left all alone, and at that moment . . . i became someone else, do you understand? even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room, nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same i somehow managed to hold out. i went on fighting them, i bit someone, i remember, and i scratched another. but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were, the ones i had observed, the ones who beat karina, what kind of people they were, the ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me. at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building. i didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. when i saw him i said, "neighbor, is that you?" in so doing i placed myself in great danger. he realized that if i lived i would remember him. that's when he grabbed the axe. the axe that had been taken from my father. i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in the air. everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the presence of a general. everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities or not. he said, "enough, let's go to the third entryway." in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik, aleksandr gambarian. this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance. almost all of them left with him, as they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had already taken the other. four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. they had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but i had never seen those three. one of them, kuliyev (i identified him later), a native of the sisian district of armenia, an azerbaijani, had moved to azerbaijan a year before. he told me in armenian: "sister, don't be afraid, i'll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here." that's just what he said, "those azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "i'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from apartment 41." that's when i found out that they had gone to apartment 41. before that, the person in the eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened to, the "general," said that they were going to the third entryway. kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. he threw it over my shoulders, i was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut. but the door was lying on the floor in the hall. i went out onto the balcony. there were broken windows, and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. it was impossible to find anything. he told me, "well, fine, i won't leave you here. would any of the neighbors let you in? they'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're alive." he told me all this in armenian. then he returned to the others and said, "what are you waiting for? leave!" they said, "ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself. no, we want to do it to." he urged them on, but gently, not coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. he led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, "leave. what's the mat- ter, aren't you men? go fight with the men. what do you want of her?" and he came back upstairs. they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn't hold them off forever. then he asked me where he could hide me. i told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them. we knocked on the door, and he explained in azerbaijani. the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said, "i'm an azerbaijani." he said, "i know. let her sit at your place a while. don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, i won't tell anyone. let her stay at your place." she says, "fine, have her come in." i went in. she cried a bit and gave me some stockings, i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. i burst into tears. even though i was wearing marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a half-length, i was cold all the same. i asked, "do you know where my family is, what happened to them?" she says, "no, i don't know anything. i'm afraid to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see who's azerbaijani and who's armenian." kuliyev left. ten minutes later my neighbor says, "you know, lyuda, i don't want to lose my life because of you, or my son and his wife. go stay with someone else." during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--i had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. the other earring was still there. when i'm nervous i fix my hair constantly, and then, when i touched my ear, i noticed that i had one earring on. i took it out and gave it to her. she took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment. i went out and didn't know where to go. i heard someone going upstairs. i don't know who it was but assumed it was them. with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment, i wanted to die in my own home. i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. i had to do something. i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. then they came in. someone said that there were still some things to take. i think that someone pushed me under the bed. i lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. i got all cut up, but i lay there without moving. my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it. there were no lights on. maybe that's what saved me. they were burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. they took father's sport jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. they pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. i almost cried out. and again i realized i wasn't getting out of there alive, and i started to strangle myself again. i took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that i would die and they would only find me afterward. they were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and i got burned, but i withstood it. something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. i knew that i was going to die, but i didn't know how. i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment, but if i found out that one of my family had died, i would die for sure, because i had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father, or without your sister. marina, i thought, was still alive: she went to lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. i tried to think that igor wouldn't let them be killed. he served in afghanistan, he should protect her. while i was strangling myself i said my good-byes to everyone. and then i thought, how could marina survive alone. if they killed all of us, how would she live all by herself? there were six people in the room. they talked among themselves and smoked. one talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was all over. they started to argue. a third one says, "how come you get it? i have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what i need. all these years i've been living in god-awful places." another one says, "neither of you gets it. we'll set fire to it and leave." then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. and they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left. oh, yes, i just remembered. while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently, "let the armenian women have babies for us, muslim babies, let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians." then they said, "those muslims can carry on our holy cause. heroes!" they repeated it very often. 		 - - - reference for #008 - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against

accounts of anti-armenian human right violations in azerbaijan #008 part b prelude to current events in nagorno-karabakh 				(part b of #008) +------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | "oh, yes, i just remembered. while they were raping me they | | repeated quite frequently, "let the armenian women have babies | | for us, muslim babies, let them bear azerbaijanis for the | | struggle against the armenians." then they said, "those | | muslims can carry on our holy cause. heroes!" they repeated | | it very often." | | | +------------------------------------------------------------------+ ...continued from part a: the six of them left. they left and i had an attack. i realized that the dan- ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. i relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. my heart and kidneys hurt. i had an awful kidney attack. i rolled back and forth on top of those christmas ornaments, howling and howling. i didn't know where i was or how long this went on. when we figured out the time, later it turned out that i howled and was in pain for around an hour. then all my strength was gone and i burst into tears, i started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . . then someone came into the room. i think i hear someone calling my name. i want to respond and restrain myself, i think that i'm hallucinating. i am silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling me, then a woman's. later i found out that mamma had sent our neighbor, the one whose apartment she was hiding in, uncle sabir kasumov, to our place, telling him, "i know that they've killed lyuda. go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse." he went and returned empty handed, but mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. she sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were walking through the rooms looking for me, but i didn't answer their calls. there was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps. they started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 i went down to the kasumovs'. i went down the stairs myself. i walked out of the apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be cowardly, afraid? come what will. i walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. no one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, opened the door. on the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, uncle sabir's son started to shout, "aunt roza, don't cry, lyuda's alive!" he knocked on his own door and out came aunt tanya, igor, and after them, mamma. aunt tanya, uncle sabir's wife, is an urdmurt. all of us were in their apartment. i didn't see karina, but she was in their home, too, lying delirious, she had a fever. marina was there too, and my father and mother. all of my family had gathered there. at the door i lost consciousness. igor and aunt tanya carried me into the apartment. later i found out what they had done to our karina. mamma said, "lyuda, karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. if she recognizes you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful." it was as though her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her cheeks . . . it was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. i said, "fine." mamma was afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged karina and started to cry. i went in. as soon as i saw her my legs gave way. i fell down near the bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. she opened the eye that was intact, looked at me, and said, "who is it?" but i could barely talk, my whole face was so badly beaten. i didn't say, but rather muttered something tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, "my karochka, my karina, my little golden one . . . " she understood me. then igor brought me some water, i drank it down and moistened karina's lips. she started to groan. she was saying something to me, but i couldn't understand it. then i made out, "it hurts, i hurt all over." her hair was glued down with blood. i stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her forehead, and on her lips . . . she was groaning again, and i don't know how to help her. she calls me over with her hand, come closer. i go to her. she's saying something to me, but i can't understand her. igor brings her a pencil and paper and says, "write it down." she shakes her head as if to say, no, i can't write. i can't understand what she's saying. she wanted to tell me something, but she couldn't. i say, "karina, just lie there a little while, then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then." and then she says, "maybe it'll be too late." and i completely . . . just broke down, i couldn't control myself. then i moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. i dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. she says, "lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. out of this damned house. they want to kill us, i know. they'll find us here, too. we need to call urshan." she repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, until i understood her every word. i ask, "what's his number?" urshan feyruzovich, that's the head of the administration where she works. "we have to call him." but i didn't know his home number. i say, "karina, what's his number?" she says, "i can't remember." i say, "who knows his number? who can i call?" she says, "i don't know anything, leave me alone." i went out of the room. igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was crying, too. i say, "mamma, karina says that we have to call urshan. how can we call him? who knows his telephone number?" i tell marina, "think, think, who can we call to find out?" she started calling; several people didn't answer. she called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back. the boss's wife answered and said he was at the dacha. my voice keeps cracking, i can't talk normally. she says, "lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can't do that." she still didn't know what was really going on. i said, "it's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's happening. they are killing people here. i don't think there is a single armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. i'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves. "she says, "well, ok, if it's that serious . . . " and all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that i'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. "ok, fine, fine," she says, "if you're afraid, ok, as soon as urshan comes back i'll send him over." we called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under aunt tanya's, on the second floor, asya dallakian's apartment. she wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in karabagh. they destroyed everything there . . . we realized that they still might come back. we kept on trying to get through to aunt tanya--urshan's wife is named tanya too and finally we get through. she says, "yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your place now." he came. of course he didn't know what was happening, either, because he brought two of his daughters with him. he came over in his jeep with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. he came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. he has grown up daughters, they're almost my age. the three of us carried out karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and went down to his car. he took karina and me to the maternity home. . . no, first they took us to the po]ice precinct. they had stretchers ready. as soon as we got out of the car they put karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have fractures. from the stretcher i saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . this was around eleven o'clock at night. we had left the house somewhere around 1:30. when i saw those soldiers i realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies . . . everything just like a war. they carried me into some office on the stretcher. the emergency medical people from baku were there. the medical attendant there was an older armenian. urshan told him what they had done to karina because she's so proud she would never have told. and this aging armenian . . . his name was uncle arkady, i think, because someone said "arkady, get an injection ready," he started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give karina a shot. but when he looked at her face he became ill. and he was an old man, in his sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. he hugged karina and started to cry: "what have they done to you?!" he was speaking armenian. "what have they done to you?!" karina didn't say anything. mamma came in then, and she started to cry, too. the man tried to calm her. "i'll give you a shot." mamma tells him, "i don't need any shot. where is the government? just what are they doing? look what they've done to my children! they're killing people, and you're just sitting here!" some teacups were standing on the table in there. "you're sitting here drinking tea! look what they've done to my daughters! look what they've turned them into!" they gave her something to drink, some heart medicine, i think. they gave karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the maternity home immediately. papa and urshan, i think, even though papa was in bad shape, helped carry karina out. when they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. i don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. then they came to me: "what's the matter with you?" their tone was so official that i wrapped myself tighter in the half-length coat. i had a blanket on, too, an orange one, aunt tanya's. i said, "i'm fine." uncle arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told the doctor, "you leave, let a woman examine her." a woman came, an azerbaijani, i believe, and said, "what's wrong with you?" i was wearing my sister lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in yerevan. when she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby. i tore the night shirt some more and showed her. i took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. there was a huge wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the indian vase. she said something to them and they gave me two shots. she said that it should be dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital. they put me on a stretcher, too. they started looking for people to carry me. i raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, i don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, "lie still, you mustn't move." when i was lying back down i saw two policemen leading a man. his profile seemed very familiar to me. i shouted, "stop!" one of the policemen turned and says, "what do you want?" i say, "bring him to me, i want to look at him." they brought him over and i said, "that person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister. i recognize him, note it down." they said, "fine," but didn't write it down and led him on. i don't know where they were taking him. then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting. they went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer. one of the soldiers started talking to me, "sister . . . " i don't remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us. i asked him, "where are you from?" he said that he was from ufa. apparently they were the first that were brought in. the ufa police. later i learned that they suffered most of all. he says, "ok, you're armenians, they didn't get along with you, but i'm a russian," he says, "what are they trying to kill me for?" oh, i remembered something else. when i went out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nails i looked out the window and saw two azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. he was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him with his own club. the way he cried "mamma" made my skin crawl. i don't know what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. and something else. before he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but i didn't think it was azerbaijanis attacking armenians. i thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with someone. it was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the armenians, that i realized that this was serious, that it was anti-armenian. they took karina and me to the sumgait maternity home. mamma went to them too and said, "i've been beaten too, help me." but they just ignored her. my father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten, and says, "my ribs hurt so much, those creeps have probably broken my ribs. please look at them." the doctor says, "that's not my job." urshan said, "fine, i'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, i'll find you one. i'll bring one and have him look at you. and he drove them to his apartment. marina and i stayed there. they examined us. i was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. i wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but i was very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the hippocratic oath could talk to victims like that. by happy--or unhappy-- coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our karina. and she, having examined karina, said, "no problem, you got off pretty good. not like they did in kafan, when you armenians were killing and raping our women. "karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she would certainly have had something to say! then they examined me. the same story. they put us in a separate ward. no shots, no medicinal powders, no drugs. absolutely none! they didn't even give us tea. all the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were armenians who had been raped. and they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at zoo animals. karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and i kept her from seeing it. they put ira b. in our ward. she had also been raped. true, she didn't have any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their place, i felt worse for them than i did for us. because when they raped ira her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. and ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed. when they were beating ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again. her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. i felt really awful when i heard that. ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, "do what you want with me, just leave my daughter alone." well, they did what they wanted. they threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. now i would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. it was simply bartholomew's night, i say, they did what they would love to do every day: steal, kill, rape . . . many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. the beasts explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those children would be grown, and then, as they put it, "we'll come take the pleasure out of their lives, those children." this was about the girls that would be young women in 15 years. they were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be of some use in 15 years. this i heard from the investigators; one of the victims testified to it. that's how they described their own natures, that they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they themselves said that. and this, too. everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our marina. many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. i don't know why their eyes were red. maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, maybe for some other reason, i don't know. but they hadn't been smoking and they weren't drunk, i'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do. and they spoke in a cultured fashion with marina: "little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over there [where i was], you might be frightened. you're a muslim, a muslim woman shouldn't see such things." so they were really quite sober . . . so we came out of that story alive. each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day. it wasn't even a day, of those several hours. father still can't look us in the eyes. he still feels guilty for what happened to karina, mother, and me. because of his nerves he's started talk- ing to himself, i've heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening: "listen," he'll say, "what could i do? what could i do alone, how could i protect them?" i don't know where to find the words, it's not that i'm happy, but i am glad that he didn't see it all happen. that's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. of course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened. and there were so many conversations: karina and i spoke together in private, and we talked with mamma, too. but father was never present at those conversations. we spare him that, if you can say that. and when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with father present. on february 29, the next clay, karina and i were discharged from the hospital. first they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. there were many people there, armenian victims. i met the tovmasian family there. from them i learned that rafik and their uncle grant had died. they were sure that both had died. they were talking to me and raya, rafik's wife and grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying. then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard. there's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area. they took us in there. the women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide. the women were shouting. they explained to them: "we want to hide you better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct." we went into the little house. there were no chairs or tables in there. we had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed. no one had anything with them. it was just awful. they kept us there for 24 hours. from the window of the one room house you could see that there were azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct, as though they were spying on us. the police precinct is surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. this brought great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48, or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost family members. for us it was another ordeal. we were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. we couldn't see a single person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. we thought that they must have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret room down there. people were panicking: they started throwing themselves at one another . . . that's the way it is on a sinking ship. we heard those people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. we felt that the end was approaching. i was completely terrified: i had left karina in the hospital and didn't know where my parents were. i was sort of calm about my parents, i was thinking only about karina, if, heaven forbid, they should attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to karina again, and she wouldn't be able to take it. then soldiers with dogs appeared. when they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence. then they brought in about another 30 soldiers. they all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. we calmed down a little. they brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children to the toilet. but we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people do eat. then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. they were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. one of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it. raya tovmasian . . . it was like a different woman had been substituted. earlier she had been crying, wailing, and calling out: "oh, rafik!," but when she heard about this such a rage came over her! she jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. and suddenly there were soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. she ran over to them. the bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. she went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him! then, on to a second, and a third. everyone was rooted to the spot. not one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it. and the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, muttering something. she came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile appeared on her face. she became so quiet: no tears, no cries. then that round was over and she went back to beat them again. she was walking and cursing terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the creeps, and so on. then she came back again and sat down. she probably did this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. she went five or six times and beat them and returned. and she told the women, "what are you sitting there for? they killed your husbands and children, they raped, and you're just sitting there. you're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened. aren't you armenians?" she appealed to everyone, but no one got up. i was just numb, i didn't have the strength to beat anyone, i could barely hold myself up, all the more so since i had been standing for so many hours--i was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the elderly and women with children who sat. i was on my feet the whole time. there was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. the situation was deplorable. at eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, azerbaijanis. they said, "get up. they've brought mattresses, you can wash up and put the children to bed." now the women didn't want to leave this place, either. the place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with dogs. if anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, "oh, it's our little family," and things like that. the soldiers felt this love, and probably, for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. everyone spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded machine guns in their hands, said, "grandmother, you mustn't approach me, i'm on guard." our people would say, "oh, that's all right." they hugged them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. this was all terribly moving for me. and the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs. they took us up to the second floor and said, "you can undress and sleep in here. don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city." this was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41a and in other places. then we were told that all the armenians were being gathered at the sk club and at the city party committee. they took us there. on the way i asked them to stop at the maternity home: i wanted to take karina with me. i didn't know what was happening there. they told me, "don't worry, the maternity home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. so you can rest assured. i say, "well, i won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in there is capable of anything." when i arrived at the city party committee it turned out that karina had already been brought there. they had seen fit to release her from the hospi- tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. once we were in the city party committee we gave free reign to our tears. we met acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with them, and so on, and those, like me, like raya, who were wearing whatever had come their way. there were even people who were all made up, dolled up like they had come from a wedding. there were people without shoes, naked people, hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. and of course the stories and the talk were flying: "oh, i heard that they killed him!" "what do you mean they killed him!" "he stayed at work!" "do you know what's happening at this and such a plant? talk like that. and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian, the teacher. i know him very well and respect him highly. i've known him for a long time. they had a small room, well really it was more like a study-room. we spent a whole night talking in that study once. on march 1 we heard that bagirov [first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr] had arrived. everyone ran to see bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside. he arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things. everyone was in a tremendous rage. but he was protected by soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with the people. apparently he had more important things to do. several hours passed. gukasian called me and says, "lyudochka, find another two or three. we're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned." i had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, "lyuda, your mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are alive and well and that you're here." i gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what i was doing and went off. the list was imprecise, of course. it included grant adamian, raya tovmasian's father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. there was engels grigorian's father and aunt, cherkez and maria. the list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor, zhanna agabekian. one of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater. we put her on the list too, and cried, but later it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk, where, thank god, she was alive and well. i should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead. 3 all the lists were taken to bagirov. i don't remember how many dead were contained in the list, but it's a fact that when gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. i asked, "what's going on?" he said, "lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels they are! they say that they lost the list of the dead. piotr demichev [member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it was one or fifty." they told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn't left for the khimik boarding house all over again. there were 26 people on our second list. i think that the number 26 was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because that's the list that demichev got. i remember exactly that there were 26 people on the list, i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list. he said, "lyuda, please, try to remember at least one more." but i couldn't remember anyone else. but there were more than 30 dead. of that i am certain. the government and the procuracy don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock. they weren't registered as victims of the sumgait tragedy. and then there may be people we didn't know. so many people left sumgait between march 1 and 8! most of them left for smaller towns in russia, and especially to the northern caucasus, to stavropol, and the krasnodarsk territory. we don't have any information on them. i know that there are people who set out for parts around moscow. in the periodical krestyanka [woman farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and i know a whole group of people went to help out. also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city, who were burned in their cars. no one knows about them, except the azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. and there's more. a great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the procuracy. i know of three instances for sure, and i of course don't know them all. i'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, they simply left. but in so doing they didn't cease being victims. one of them is the first cousin of my classmate kocharian. she lived in microdistrict no. 8, on the fifth floor. i can't tell you the building number and i don't know her name. then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. i don't know her name, she lives on the same landing as the sumgait procurator. they beat her father, he was holding the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid. like the azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. and the third one . . . i don't remember who the third one was anymore. they transferred us on march 1. karina still wasn't herself. yes, we lived for days in the sk, in the cultural facility, and at the khimik. they lived there and i lived at the city party committee because i couldn't stay with karina; it was too difficult for me, but i was at peace: she had survived. i could already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. thanks to the social work i did there, i managed to persevere. aleksandr mikhailovich said, "if it weren't for the work i would go insane." he and i put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food, and we went to get them. the first days we bought everything, although we should have received it for free. they were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. then, when we found out it was free, we went to krayev. at the time, fortunately, you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces. krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue. on march 2 they sent two investigators to see us: andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev. the way it worked out, in our family they had considered only karina and me victims, maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital. mother and father are considered witnesses, but not victims. shirokov was involved with karina's case, and bibishev, with mine. after i told him everything, he and i planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. we didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren't there. the investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or video cameras. i think that this was done on purpose. we're not so poor that we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. it was done especially to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw that the armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to sumgait. and the armenians had a lot to say i came to an agreement with bibishev, i told him myself, "don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two months, i'll be here. i'm not afraid, i looked death in the eyes five times in those two days, i'll help you conduct the investigation." he and i worked together a great deal, and i used this to shelter karina, i gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her- self. she was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x- rays. she couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. i didn't eat and drank virtually nothing for five days. then, on the fifth day, when we were in baku already, the investigator told me, "how long can you go on like this? well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through. we need you." then i started eating, because in fact i was exhausted. it wasn't enough that i kept seeing those faces in our apart- ment in my mind, every day i went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons. i don't know . . . we were just everywhere! probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of sumgait. at that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement. thus far i have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. mamma identified three, and karina, two. the total is 36. marina didn't identify anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, but they weren't among the photographs of those detained. i told of the neighbor i recognized. the one who went after the axe. he still hasn't been detained, he's still on the loose. he's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. i don't know his first or last name. i know which building he lived in and i know his sisters' faces. but he's not in the city. the investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him. the 31 people i identified are largely blue-collar workers from various plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect. mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. only one of them was a student. he was attending the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga- tor. once, thinking that i was an employee and not a victim, she said in front of me "i'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash simply for keeping him out of armenia," that is, to keep him from landing in a prison on armenian soil. they're all terribly afraid of that, because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological pressure--they say, "fine, don't confess, just keep silent. when you're in an armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you in short order." that somehow gets to them. many give in and start to talk. the investigators and i were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. it was only then that i saw the way they had left our apartment. even without knowing who was in our apartment, you could guess. they stole, for example, all the money and all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. they tore them up, burned them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. only the materials from the 27th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore cooper's last of the mohigans. oh yes, lunch was ready, we were boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. after they had been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. that's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't even know anything about books. they didn't take a single book, but they did take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out slippers. of those whom i identified, four were kafan azerbaijanis living in sumgait. basically, the group that went seeking "revenge"--let's use their word for it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. i talked with one of them. he had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that black i remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building 16. she was an older armenian who had recently arrived from georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in sumgait. i don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an azerbaijani. i had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know nothing about her. i do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe. murdering her wasn't enough for them. they hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water. i remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. you know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both their hair and their skin. and in contrast with them, in addition to the grey- eyed one, i remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a lezgin. i identified him. as it turned out he was eduard robertovich grigorian, born in the city of sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. one of our own. how did i remember him? the name rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. i kept thinking, is that rita or "puma," which it would be if you read the word as latin characters instead of cyrillic, because the cyrillic "t" was the one that looks like a latin "m." when they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back. this was at the confrontation. he swore on every holy book, tried to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and told me that i was making a mistake, and called me "dear sister." he said, "you're wrong, how could i, an armenian, raise my hand against my own, an armenian," and so on. he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me, "lyuda, are you sure it was he?" i told him, "i'll tell you one more identifying mark. if i'm wrong i shall apologize and say i was mistaken. the name rita is tattooed on his left or right hand." he went rigid and became pale. they told him, "put your hands on the table." he put his hands on the table with the palms up. i said, "now turn your hands over," but he didn't turn his hands over. now this infuriated me. if he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they forced him or something else, i would have treated him somewhat differently. but he insolently stuck to his story, "no, i did not do anything, it wasn't me." when they turned his hands over the name rita was in fact tattooed on his hand. his face distorted and he whispered something wicked. i immediately flew into a rage. there was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. catching myself quite by surprise, i hurled that ashtray at him. but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back. and he smiled. when he smiled it provoked me further. i don't know how, but i jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him; i no longer remember which. when i jumped i caught the microphone cord. the investigator was there, tolya . . .i no longer recall his last name, and he says, "lyudochka, it's a japanese microphone! please . . . " and shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. they took him away. i stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, because we needed to go on working, i only remember tolya telling me, "you're some actress! what a performance!" i said, "tolya, honestly . . . " beforehand they would always tell me, "lyuda, more emotion. you speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you." i say, "i don't have any more strength or emotion. all my emotions are behind me now, i no longer have the strength . . . i don't have the strength to do anything." and he says, "lyuda, how were you able to do that?" and when i returned to normal, drinking tea and watching the tape, i said, "can i really have jumped over that table? i never jumped that high in gym class." so you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. of the 36 we identified there was an armenian, a russian, vadim vorobyev, who beat mamma, and 34 azerbaijanis. at the second meeting with grigorian, when he had completely confessed his guilt, he told of how on february 27 the azerbaijanis had come knocking. among them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. they said, "tomorrow we're going after the armenians. meet us at the bus station at three o'clock." he said, "no, i'm not coming." they told him, "if you don't come we'll kill you." he said, "alright, i'll come." and he went. they also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, kamo pogosian. he had also been in prison; i think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. they called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing: "tomorrow we're going to get the armenians. be there." he said, "no." they pulled a knife on him. he said, "i'm not going all the same." and in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times, in the stomach. he was taken to the hospital. i know he was in the hospital in baku, in the republic hospital. if we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th. i'll return to grigorian, what he did in our apartment. i remember that he beat me along with all the rest. he spoke azerbaijani extremely well. but he was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him, too. but later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian. i don't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment; i didn't see, i don't remember. but the people who were in our apartment who didn't yet know that he was an armenian said that he did. i don't know if he confessed or not, and i myself don't recall because i blacked out very often. but i think that he didn't participate in the rape of karina because he was in the apartment the whole time. when they carried her into the courtyard, he remained in the apartment. at one point i was talking with an acquaintance about edik grigorian. from her i learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is russian, he doesn't have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. well this will be his third and, i hope, last sentence. he beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work with bruises. his wife was an armenian by the name of rita. the others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. you really can't call them beasts, they're just little beasts. they were robots carrying out someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, "i don't understand how i could have done that, i was out of my head." but we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. in the name of allah, in the name of the koran, in the name of propagating islam-- that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do. because i saw they didn't have minds of their own, i'm not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. no education, they work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were promised that if they slaughtered the armenians they would receive apartments. so off they went. many of them explained their participation saying, "they promised us apartments." among them was one who genuinely repented. i am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. he worked at a children's home, an azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at the children's home too. everything that they acquired, everything that they have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or grandparents. and he said, "i didn't need anything i just don't know . . . how i ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. i had no will of my own, i had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing." and the whole time i kept repeating, "now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes." he sat there and just wailed. but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. he performed a marvelous disappearing act, but i think that they'll get onto him, they just have to work a little, because that vadim, that boy, according to his grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how to cover his tracks. he was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained. that one in the eskimo dogskin coat was at the gambarians' after aleksandr gambarian was murdered. he came in and said, "let's go, enough, you've spilled enough blood here." maybe karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them. i heard this from aunt tanya and her sons, the kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. they liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. when karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to the entryway. they saw that she was still alive and came back, they were already at the third entryway, on their way to the gambarians'. they came back and started beating her to finish her. if she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. an older woman from our building, aunt nazan, an azerbaijani, all but lay on top of karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off. the woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands and led her home. she howled and cried out loudly and swore: god is on earth, he sees everything, and he won't forgive this. there was another woman, too, aunt fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first floor, she's already retired. mountain dwellers, and azerbaijanis, too, have a custom: if men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them. but they trampled her scarf and sent her home. to trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman's honor. now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little, i think about how could these events that are now called the sumgait tragedy happen? how did they come about? how did it start? could it have been avoided? well, it's clear that without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not have happened. all the same, i'm not afraid to say this, the azerbaijanis, let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their nations, let them take no offense, but the azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for what they have done. and when the law said that they could do all that, like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done, to snatch a bit more. the smell of the danger was already in the air on february 27. you could tell that something was going to happen. and everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. many left for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got as far away as their legs would carry them. february 27 was a saturday. i was teaching my third class. the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out, that there had been a call from the city party committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at lenin square. well, i excused the children, and there were few teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or seven men. the rest had already gone home. we got to lenin square and there were a great many people there. this was around five-thirty or six in the evening, no later. they were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. they spoke over the microphone about what had happened in kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus. the speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had seen it himself..the crowd started to rage: "death to the armenians! they must be killed!" then a woman went up on stage. i didn't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies. i could only hear her. the woman introduced herself as coming from kafan, and said that the armenians cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, "sons, avenge my daughters!" that was enough. a portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories, toward the beginning of lenin street. we stood there about an hour. then the director of school 25 spoke, he gave a very nationalist speech. he said, "brother muslims, kill the armenians!" this he repeated every other sentence. when he said this the crowd supported him stormily, whistling and shouting "karabagh!" he said, "karabagh has been our territory my whole life long, karabagh is my soul. how can you tear out my heart?" as though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh. "it's our territory, the armenians will never see it. the armenians must be eliminated. from time immemorial muslims have cleansed the land of infidel armenians, from time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years the azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth." by filth he meant armenians. i heard this. before that i hadn't been listening to the speeches closely. many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate, that in fact something serious was taking place. then, when one of our teachers said, "listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's spouting," we listened. that was the speech of that director. before that we listened to the woman's speech. right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. our director of studies, for whom i had great respect, he's an azerbaijani . . . before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. so he tells me, "lyuda, you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square? if they find out that you're an armenian they'll tear you to pieces. should i tell them you're an armenian? should i tell them you're an armenian?" when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a second time. i turned to the director, khudurova, and said that it was already after eight, i was expected at home, and i should be leaving. she answered, "no, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until twelve. stay here." there was a young teacher with us, her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. she asked to leave: "i left my children at the kindergarten." the director excused her. when she let her go i turned around, said, "good-bye," and left with the young teacher, the azerbaijani. i didn't see them after that. when we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us. they had apparently gotten all fired up. it must have become too much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed off. i wasn't afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher wouldn't say that i was an armenian. to make it short, we reached home. then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there. i started telling of my experience and again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. we watched television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day. that's how it all was. at the city party committee i met an acquaintance, we went to school together, zhanna, i don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street. she was there with her father, for some reason she doesn't have a mother. the two of them were at home alone. while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the entryway. that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there. she jumped. she jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the moment. a few days later i found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been injured somehow. that's how people in sumgait saved their lives, their honor, and their children: any way they could. where it was possible, the armenians fought back. my father's first cousin, armen m., lives in block 30. they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town. the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even with muskets and went up to the roof. they took their infants with them, and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months, they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an azerbaijani who lived in their building. they called the school board director and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 armenians on the roof, to escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. i'm sure, of course, that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time. she called the police. the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment, into block 30. that's how they defended themselves. i heard that our neighbors, roman and sasha gambarian, resisted. they're big, strong guys. their father was killed. and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother. one of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking for the criminals on march 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead. the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses. i don't know how many. even if they had been wounded and put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection--that basement was filled with water. i heard this from the neighbors. and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it. i know, too, that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. and our neighbor carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing as one of the criminals. everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor took his, too, and carried it home. and when we came back, when everything seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to "save." raya's husband and father defended themselves. the trdatovs defended themselves, and so did other armenian families. to be sure there were azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. for some reason our government doesn't want to say that the armenians were not just victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. in the tv show "pozitsiya" [viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that the armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. but that's not important, the truth will come out regardless. so that's the price we paid those three days. for three days our courage, our bravery, and our humanity was tested. it was those three days, and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've become, what we grew up to be. those three days showed who was who. on that i will conclude my narrative on the sumgait tragedy. it should be said that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga- tion. that's the price we paid to live in armenia, to not fear going out on the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're armenians, and to not fear speaking our native tongue. october 15,1988 yerevan 			- - - reference for #008 - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet

dear folks, i am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment. it is a fact that the inhabitants of gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life. they habe been kept under occupation by israel since 1967 without civil and political rights. it is a fact that gazans live in their own country, palestine. gaza is not a foriegn country. nor is telaviv, jaffa, askalon, beersheba foreign country for gazans. all these places are occupied as far as palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it. it is a fact that zionists deny gazans equal rights as israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government. when zionists will begin to consider gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. not before. somebody mentioned that gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore israel is entitled to close its borders to gaza. in this case, gaza should be entitled to reciprocate, and deny israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area. as the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading. to close off 700,000 people in the strip, deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a crime. it is neither justifiable nor legal. it just reflects the abyss to which israeli society has degraded. i would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why israel denies gazans who were born and brought up in jaffa to return and live there ? would they be allowed to, if they converted to judaism ? is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? please give an honest answer. elias

i really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical stance. on the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of arab-americans that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/ registration information in california) and other forms of "monitoring", including blatant attempts by paid adl agents to discredit an american-arab organization by trying to distribute nazi propaganda. furthermore, you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing to the wtc bombing, in which arab-americans had no involvement. on the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail against notions of a racial (jewish, in this case) conspiracy and stereotypes. if you really aren't the hypocrite you appear to be, please explain yourself. in article <c6010c.jdi@news.cso.uiuc.edu> eshneken@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu (edward a shnekendorf) writes: >the following flyer was distributed at aipac's 34th annual policy conference: > >because when we're not in israel, we're told to go back where we came from and >when we come back to israel we're told to go back to where we came from and >when we're vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford >to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can >afford to because jews are so rich and when we don't buy something it's because >we're cheap and because when we are poor we're called dirty jew and ignorant >and when we're not we're called called rich jew and jap and when we are visibly >organized it's because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and when we're not it >is because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and because we're told we're not >a people and when we say we are we're still told that we're not and when we >marry our own people we're called racist and we don't we're contaminating >someone else's "race" and because we're under fire from the left and from the >right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because >there are non-whites who hate us for being white and because anti-semitic >incidents are rising every year but we're told that anti-semitism doesn't >exist or that we're paranoid and because we're told to shut up about the >holocaust and yet holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are >"obnoxious" we're called japs and when we are "nice" we're told we don't act >jewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is >not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are >we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of >the jewish national liberation movement: zionism.

	the honest answer to your question about arabs who were expelled from jaffa, and/or who fled jaffa, or anywhere else in israel, having the right to return is: yes, unfortunately, they have the right to return. they may apply for citizenship like any other non-israeli and then go to >jaffa and try to buy their house back from the jews who now own it. 	and now a question and answer for you: can the jews who were born and raised in hebron, or their descendants go back to their homes in hebron? the answer is: absolutely not, because they were almost all murdered by their arab neighbors - the "palestinians". 	now, do i think the arabs should be allowed to even visit "their" homes in jaffa? hell, no. bring back the jews of hebron, petah tikva, jerusalem, safed, etc. then, perhaps i would be in favor of arabs returning to their jaffa homes. however, seeing as no arab has yet been able to bring people back from the dead, i'd say that's out. with all the hope in the world, nissan ratzlav-katz nraclaw@jade.tufts.edu

(the rest of the article is available from elias davidsson, email: elias@ismennt.is) so what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happens there now, we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the jews arrived and that they were driven away by the jews, noone on earth knows about what the jews did there." is that what you said? could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote? btw, try asking beduins in sinai how they mis the israelis. not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the idf to have at least one full brigade of them. -- --amos shapira (jumper extraordinaire) | "it is true that power corrupts, c.s. system group, hebrew university, | but absolute power is better!" jerusalem 91904, israel | amoss@cs.huji.ac.il | -- the demon to his son

"i would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, dor tashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining the fate of the people and founding the jewish state, had been lost." rabin added, "we must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in the territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes in israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its own labor." the prime minister concluded saying that he would like to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during his government's term. --- naftaly stramer 			 | intergraph electronics internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com | 6101 lookout road, suite a voice: (303)581-2370 fax: (303)581-9972 | boulder, co 80301 "quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

it is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is interested in what i actually said, i never compared the israeli treatment of the palestinians with the holocaust. anyway that is the truth if it matters. i was about to forget about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic for making the comparison that i never made. what i did say was that the nazis didn't start with the holocaust and their initial actions were similar to what the israelis are doing now. 	the jews that were stranded on the polish border since no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the lebenese border. no trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on guilt due to race.

there are basically three alternatives for gaza: 1. to throw the jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave the middle-east and go back to where they came from (russia, europe, usa, etc) 2. to throw the gazans into the sea, in accordance with yitzhak rabin's wish and that of many zionists. 3. for israelis and palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (i don't attempt to say just) settlement, which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality. i personnaly opt for the third alternative. how about you folks ? elias

"knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies." source: stanford j. shaw, "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey," vol ii. cambridge university press, london, 1979, pp. 314-317.

orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious independence, granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in 1870, to the serbian church in 1879, and to the rumanian church in 1885, with subsequent aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>> page 188: <<...they [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian missionaries, who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence. christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity, soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past. vicious anti-muslim and anti-semitic movements developed, involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies, by the independent states that resulted, also by christian subjects who remained within the empire, particularly because of jewish and muslim support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of southeastern europe. the results were explosive and damaging. the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting nationalists and, later, successfully established independent christian states, committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout the nineteenth century, despite great power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of paris (1858) and berlin (1878),...>> page 188: <<...as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence, their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries earlier. this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century, with the rumanian principalities taking the lead, as united rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century. in 1579 the ruler of moldavia, peter the lame, banished its jews because of their competition with its christian merchants. when prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian principalities of wallachia and moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest.>> page 189: <<the slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. when the greeks revolted against ottoman rule many greek volunteers coming from russia and the principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the jewish communities along their paths as they went through moldavia and wallachia toward greece.>> page 190 (second paragraph): <<when venice occupied the island of chios in 1694, its jewish population was either massacred or deported and all jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native greek population, leaving those jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to compete with the greeks in trade or commerce.>> page 190 (third paragraph): <<jews living in greece and the rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for ottoman rule. when the greek nationalist movement philike etairia started its uprising in wallachia and moldavia during the spring of 1821, hundreds of jews and muslims were killed by the greeks who lived there as well as by native wallachs [14]. during the height of the greek revolution, five thousand jews were massacred in morea along with most of the muslim population, numbering about twenty thousand in all [15]. in tripolizza alone 1,200 jews were massacred along with uncounted turks [16]. reverend john hartley, after describing the carnage, concluded 'thus did jewish blood, mingled with turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. the sons of isaac and the sons of ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the greek revolution, met with common fate. their corpses were cast out of the city, and, like the ancient sovereign of judah, they received no burial superior to that of an ass.' [17] jewish communities on the islands of sparta, patras, corinthos, mistra, and argos were wiped out by bands of greek rebels along with those of thebes, vrachori, attica and epirus [18]. the surviving jews fled to the island of corfu, where jews who had fled from italy, and the iberian peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into rival greek and italian communities. it was not long, however, before it too fell victim to the greek revolution, leading to savage repression and massacres of jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time. throughout the years of greek revolution, greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the agean, exterminating all the jews and muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the ottoman empire. contemporary accounts relate that the greeks left the murdered jews and muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. most of the jews who survived these massacres fled across the agean in small boats to izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of ottoman jewish life during the nineteenth century. only in northern greece, particularly in the areas of janina and salonica, were the jews and the turks able to successfully resist the greek assaults, thus saving their populations from massacre as well [20]. during the remainder of the 19th century, particularly during the greek-turkish war in 1897, those jews who remained in greece in the areas of athens, chalkis, larissa, corfu and crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands more to emigrate into ottoman territory, particularly to salonica and izmir [21].>> page 193 (last paragraph): <<the inclusion in the treaty of berlin of stipulations providing protection for the jewish and muslim minorities in southeastern europe stimulated more popular anti-semitic and anti-muslim hysteria in all the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting jewish shopkeepers, merchants and professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the christian millets in the major cities of the ottoman empire. because the bulgarians, rumanians and greeks correctly regarded the jews as supporters of the turks, both jews and turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners. their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors fled in desperation to edirne and istanbul. while official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to jews, little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century.>> page 194 (last paragraph): <<things were not much better elsewhere in southeastern europe or the greek islands of the agean and the eastern mediterranean. in 1891 the jews on corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. many of those who survived found refuge in ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in istanbul under leadership of the banque camondo. in 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903, thousands of jews came to ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite. in 1899 jewish families arrived in istanbul in flight from persecution in vidin, in independent bulgaria. the conquest of ottoman thrace and macedonia by greek and bulgarian forces during the balkan wars (1912-13), including salonica, corlu, and edirne, was followed by general attacks on jews, their synagogues, homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus toward istanbul and beyond. two reports from salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies: 'all the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of europe, all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the greeks in salonica. a week of terror and horror one can never easily forget. the hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the (greek) population has done to their cause. the mob has shown itself odious and the government weak...the incompetence of the greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. the consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the muslims, but sixty of them were massacred in a single night....'[28] 'it wasn't only irregulars (comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and burned. the soldiers of the army, the chief of police, and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at serres. out of 6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. almost 1,200 shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs. the (jewish) population lost all, and without even anything to wear is in despair. everyone wants to emigrate...'[29] page 196: <<as a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from the independent countries of southeastern europe, the ottoman empire received literally thousands of jewish refugees who joined the muslims who survived the persecution,

(305 pages). (memoirs of an armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people) "foreword:" "for example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined tartar mosque, the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border of persia and russian armenia. during the course of evening i asked ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. in his matter of fact way he replied, yes, i assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." p. 15 (second paragraph). "the tartars were, for the most part, poor. some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains. even the village tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized." "i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars, and, while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility." p. 20 (second paragraph). "our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village. there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain. throughout the hideous night, i cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. by morning the work was finished." p. 109 (second paragraph). "as things were, the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. when they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days. the outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. the method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts." p. 203 (first paragraph). "a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar. i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar's head with it... the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in russian, 'slodkey! slodkey!' (sweet.)" p. 203 (second paragraph). "one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village. among the ruins a fire was burning. i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. among them were two tartar girls, mere children. the girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes. there were also bodies of the dead." p. 204 (first paragraph). "i was soon asleep. in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. i arose and went to investigate. a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. guided by the child's crying, i entered the yard of a house, which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a turkish family. there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead. her throat had been cut. lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old." p. 118. "slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. in the carts, the women, veiled as is the tartar way, held children in their arms. wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. a few old men plodded along on foot. across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. this massacre was not complete. the armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed." p. 192. "great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced.... they entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the turks." p. 193. "terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars, kurds and turks. their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country." p. 195. "the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: tartars, kurds and russians." p. 218. (first and second paragraphs) "russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages...we armenians did not spare the tartars....if persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. they had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. they had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. they had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself." p. 133 (first paragraph) "in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians abandoned the struggle. during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. i was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. some, mercifully, were shot. many of them were burned to death. the method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with turks, set fire to the straw." p. 19 (first paragraph) "the tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. the same fate befell the tartar section of khankandi." p. 22 (second paragraph) "many of our men had served in the russian army, and were trained soldiers. we armenians were rich and possessed arms. tartars had never received military training. they were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village, the revolution in russia was suppressed." p. 97 (third paragraph) "within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government. this secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees." p. 98 (first paragraph) "the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish government." p. 98 (third paragraph) "...the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene and secure independence for turkish armenia." p. 99 (second paragraph) "the dashnacks were fanatics." p. 99 (third paragraph) "the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the russian province. they instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich armenians. a wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death. every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question. if a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party." p. 130 (first paragraph) "...in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars, they [armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance." p. 130 (third paragraph) "the city was a scene of confusion and terror. during the early days of the war, when the russian troops invaded turkey, large numbers of the turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian advance." p. 159 (second paragraph) "i made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. i made balls for it. with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out." p. 181 (first paragraph) "the tartar villages were in ruins." p. 189 (third paragraph) "the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned." serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

in the following report: _turkey eyes regional role_ ankara, turkey (ap) april 27, 1993, we find in the last paragraph: [turanist] although premier suleyman demirel criticized ozal's often [turanist] brash calls for more turkish influence, he also has spoken [turanist] of a swath of turkic peoples "stretching from the adriatic [turanist] sea to the great wall of china." who does demirel think he is fooling? it seems at both ends of his envisioned pan-turkic empire -- the balkans and the caucasus -- turkey's fascist boasts are being pre-empted. i would suggest turkey let the world feel some of their "grey wolf teeth", and attempt to stretch from the adriatic to china! turkey will have cried "wolf" just once too much! -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal

"mamma," says gayane, "you'll never believe what's going on out there! it's awful!" ira says, "aunt zina, they're shouting, 'karabagh! karabagh! karabagh is ours!' we didn't know what was going on. they're threatening to drive out the armenians and slaughter them." i called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. i said, "aunt tamara, don't worry, ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later." i couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. i was worried about vika. my god, what was going on, what had happened?! -gayane: that day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening, although mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. there weren't 50 yards between our building and the bus station. we could see and hear everything perfectly. they were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading all the passengers out, looking for armenians. if they found an armenian on the bus, then it started . . .i don't know what to call it . . . -zinaida: it's called slaughter. -gayane: the mob would descend on people and beat them. i don't know if they were killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving, as though nothing was left of them. one person was lying there and they started dragging him. the police were standing right there, to the side, not doing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob. it was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. and you couldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later. we wanted to leave sumgait that day. what kept us was the idea that we live in the soviet union, and that something would be done about it. where in the world was our government?! -zinaida: we couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't home. and at the same time i was terrified for gaya and diana. on sunday morning when i went to see ira home, our neighbor said, "zin', you know they went into valodya's house and smashed everything he had. they murdered his father and two sons." valodya is our neighbor, he's an armenian, he lives on the first floor. i think, my god, what is happening?! and in broad daylight! i saw ira home and when on the way back i came across a mob shouting "slay the armenians! karabagh is ours!" this was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. on the way i stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, "they beat our store manager, they thought he was an armenian and they beat him, but he was an azerbaijani." and i asked, "did they kill him?" she says, "no, he's in serious condition." i left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the mob started moving in my direction. i turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the sputnik store. there i met another crowd, but these weren't bandits, these were our people from sumgait. i was so frightened that i walked without knowing where was going, i couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my feet. i was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes. this was on the 27th, around evening time. he ran under our balcony, and the mob surged toward him shouting, "he's an armenian, get him!" he wore a black coat. they grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, i saw it. they grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt. i made it home but i just couldn't calm down. my oldest daughter was in my thoughts. i was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone. there's no police, no protection, nothing. it's like they had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. i can't even find the words for it! i look and see an ikarus arriving. before going to the bus station they stop near our place, across from the kosmos movie theater. so this ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling, the azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling, "armenians out!" and i see them take the armenians and beat them, killing them. i can't watch it any more. it was a nightmare. i just couldn't watch it. but gaya was standing there watching it, and i scolded her. she says, "mamma, i have to see it, i have to know what's happening, i have to see it with my own eyes so i can tell our people of it later. so our children will know." gayane: we saw a great deal on the 27th. they caught no less than 20 people before my eyes. i can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . . -zinaida: there were too many people there, the mob was too big. you couldn't make anything out. but i saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. he was 18 or 19 years old. -gayane: i think he was older, probably, about 22. a tall fellow, a big guy, in a coat. he was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an armenian, he tore off running. and the mob went after him. they caught him right under our balcony. i don't know. i don't think there could have been much left of him after that. you can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person. it was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. you know, there was a similarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black coats. you couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they all looked alike. -zinaida: when they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried "mamma!" i ran into the room. i couldn't watch any longer. an awful lot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, several people were being beaten up. you couldn't see all of it at once, but when that boy cried "mamma!" i immediately started watching only him. -gayane: on that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night. at midnight they dispersed and the police took their place. they were scattered about in all districts. but how can you explain the fact that by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven o'clock, our police were gone? the police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits. in the morning they started gathering at our inter- section again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. from morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine o'clock you couldn't even see the ground. there were thousands of people in the crowd. again they began stopping vehicles and checking for armenians. -zinaida: they had signals. i realized that when i noticed that they made a cross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. the cross, evidently, meant that the vehicle had armenians in it. they let the azerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the armenian ones and started their pogrom. -gayane: they stopped a white zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was. he got out and said they were from baku. "but what is your nationality?" he says armenian. they immediately start shouting, "ermeni, ermeni!" and he says, "what's going on? i'm coming from baku. i don't live in sumgait." "doesn't matter, who cares if you're from baku or sumgait." anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a woman--his wife, probably--out of the car. at this point the police came and took the two and led them away. then the mob started smashing the car, and then burned it. the flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! then everyone ran away, they thought the car was going to explode. about 20 minutes later another car comes along, a green moskvich. they ran up shouting "ermeni! ermeni!" but this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't beat them. maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged from the flames. the neighbor boy vakhit was standing on the balcony too, acquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, "yes, they burned them along with the car." about two hours later a whole wedding procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. we thought they were armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. they were azerbaijanis, and they were immediately allowed through. -zinaida: the driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' the whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely. -gayane: by the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard of our building, there was a wedding that day. the azerbaijanis were cele- brating and dancing. on the streets there was grief and death, people were being killed, and people were celebrating the whole time. -zinaida: before the apartment itself was attacked i asked gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. she went to her girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third floor. gaya came back and said, "mamma, the bus is supposed to come around eight, after eight." you can imagine what i was feeling, how hard it was: vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. then i heard shouting. i raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. they were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. i started to cry. i am walking around the room, crying, wailing: vika's not here, what will come of her . . . gaya, of course, was consoling me: "mamma, nothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, they'll look out for her." diana: i saw the green car burn. the car was burning when we went out onto the balcony. gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. i left. then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any armenians here. -zinaida: you're right, i forgot about that, that was on the 27th. diana: there's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees planted there. the mob asked if there were any armenians in the building. all the neighbors said, no, there are no armenians here. there weren't a lot of armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few armenian families, either. -gayane: they fell upon the apartments on the 28th. there were terribly many of them. our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them. -zinaida: katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. he said that two people, azerbaijanis, had been killed in karabagh. and when he said that . . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? it was like the buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard, howling and shouting. i don't know how to describe it. by this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when i looked out of the bedroom window--the znaniye bookstore is down there, and armenians live on the second and fourth floors--i saw their things being thrown out the windows. i realized that they would be upon us any minute. i shouted to gayane, "gaya, hide the gold." that's honestly what i told my child. i grabbed diana. i didn't know what to do! vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting dark. i was afraid to look at the time because i was already horrified as it was. -gayane: just in case, we changed the television channel from the moscow station to the azerbaijani one. -zinaida: and turned it up loud. -gayane: we never listened to azerbaijani music. it just didn't do much for us. in all those years we almost never listened to it. but sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on azerbaijani television. and that was it. and here we had it turned up full blast. so they would think we were azerbaijanis. -zinaida: well you can imagine, they're slaughtering armenians, robbing them, and we're listening to this concert music from baku. our azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told gaya to turn on azerbaijani music. but we already had it on anyway. turn on the lights, they told us, so they will think you're not armenians. they're saying the armenians are afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding. -gayane: apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed that the lights were off only in armenian apartments, that is, the azerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on. when we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and later, another one. "turn on the lights," they told us, "please. nothing will happen. be calm. nothing will happen." -zinaida: "we won't allow them to come into your apartment." -gayane: we believed those people. we had never done anything bad to them. -zinaida: after the whole nightmare, about march 15, before we left for armenia, when i was coming into the building they were all crying. the azerbaijanis were crying, saying, "can it be there is no god? how could they raise their hands against your family? you never did anyone any harm, you never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune, or in time of mourning. how could they give you away? how could they sell you down the river?" they really had given us away. some of them protected us, but others gave us away. they sold us down the river. -gayane: i was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began i became cautious for some reason and i changed my clothes. azerbaijani women don't wear pants. young armenian and russian girls in sumgait wore pants, but the azerbaijanis found that very strange. and i thought i better put on a skirt, otherwise they won't believe me if i told them we were azerbaijanis. there was nothing else we could do. no other way out. i was forced to turn myself into god knows who. i let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head. -zinaida: and she told me, "mamma, you hide. take diana and go into the other room. you two look more like armenians. they'll figure out that we're armenians right away." but how could i go away and leave her there?! -gayane: i went out onto the balcony. it worked out better that way. we were the only armenian family in the fourth entryway. this gave us hope: we were the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. they, the azerbaijanis, would fear for themselves and for their children. i looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony. when we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. so i turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. he looks at me and shouts, "what nationality are you here?" -zinaida: at the same time they were knocking on the door. -gayane: "what nationality are you?" he's shouting. well at first i was frightened, but then i got control of myself and answered in perfect azerbaijani, "you should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that. can't you see i'm an azerbaijani? if i were an armenian would i come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?" he looks at me and tells the people with him, "yes, azerbaijanis live here." from below they tell him, "check it out, it can't be, they have to be armenians." and he asks me again, "what nationality are you?" i say, "can't you see?" i started fuming. i could not say anything else. "you're blind, that's for sure! you can yell all you want, but that won't make us armenians." i hear them breaking down our door, and mamma went toward the door. i say, "i don't have time to deal with you, they're breaking down our door." 1 go to the door and ask, "who is it?" they answer, "open up!" i say, "wait, why are you breaking the door? what's going on? i'm opening up." we never locked the lower lock, it was broken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and i couldn't get it open. i say wait, i'm looking for the key. i opened the door--it was almost broken down already. i opened the door and they burst in. i say, "what's going on? why are you breaking down our door?" -zinaida: then they started climbing in from the balcony. they're shouting, "why don't you open the door?" and i say, "well you've already come in the balcony." then diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the door. gaya cries out, "mamma, diana ran into the bathroom!" i ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be azerbaijanis, and said in armenian: "diana, open the door!" gaya tried to calm them down, and i'm shouting with tears in my eyes for diana to open the door. -diana i was sitting on the couch with my doll, little red riding hood. that guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. they put it up to mamma's stomach. i ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and slammed it behind me. i was frightened, and started to cry. i shouted, "mamma, they want to kill you!" and then . . . then they started shouting, "give us your passports." and gaya says, "what do you need passports for, we're azerbaijanis." -gayane: i tried to convince them that we were azerbaijanis, i was trying everything i could, i could get on my knees and plead. i could humble myself, because at that moment i was worried about other lives than just my own. to be honest i didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would survive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! i tell them, "what, don't you understand anything?" they started shouting, they were tremendously excited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in stepanakert their girls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. why shouldn't they do the same to us? i said, "who's doing all that? who is doing it? some armenians! what does that have to do with us? give me the knife, i'll cut my own face." "now you calm down," they tell me. zinaida: i told them, "why didn't you deal with them there! there, in karabakh? nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we with the armenians, nor they with us. why didn't you give it right back to them there? what've we got to do with this?" i got confused. i had been saying that we were azerbaijanis, but suddenly i started speaking as though i were an armenian, but they didn't notice. one of them was next to me, with a knife at my breast. and he says to the others, "what pretty girls." he meant gaya and my 10-year-old diana. i was terrified. gaya started assuring them that we were azerbaijanis. one guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks. -gayane: he demanded the passports. i said, "young man, i don't have my passport here." he says, "let's have the passport, we won't believe you without your passport." and one of them started hurriedly searching for documents. they turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the picture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling and shouting, "passport! passport!" they all started yelling, there was so much noise in the apartment. they were all shouting. my hair stood on end. suddenly i said, "listen, my papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a muslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, you've disgraced your honor." and then mamma started to cry. -zinaida: i started crying: "my husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed, aren't you ashamed of yourselves!" in fact my husband had died seven years earlier, in 1981. "we're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu- ments. the documents are at the housing office, i'm filing for my pension." well it seemed like they believed us. then one guy said, "they're lezgins. can't you see, there are no men here, only women. leave." another fellow in the group agreed with him, he also said that we were lezgins. but a third said, "no, they're armenians." well the other two convinced him, i don t know how, and all the rest of them listened to them too. there were about 50 of them, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was filled. they started leaving. yes, we're lezgins, we're lezgins." they started leaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. and the one who had first called us lezgins says, "leave that, what are you doing?" they seemed to obey that guy. -gayane: he was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat. -zinaida: with a little moustache, i think. -gayane: no, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he wasn't a bad-looking sort. he didn't have anything in his hands. -zinaida: he stood at the threshold. -gayane: yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed familiar to me. i had seen him somewhere. and more than once. but i can't remember where. when he came in i was stupefied, i had a premonition that he wouldn't be able to remain indifferent. when he said that we were lezgins and that they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. hope. they continued to argue on their way out. some said, "they're armenians all the same." and that fellow answered, "even if they are armenians, it's shameful, the father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, there's no men. we should stay out of the apartment." "what do you mean, stay out? we can go in there!" and he said, "no, we should stay out, they're lezgins, we're leaving here." the three of them protected us. -zinaida: no, the two of them. the one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. well they were all young really. the two of them defended us. -diana: three, three! -zinaida: do you remember the third one, diana? -diana: yes, he was wearing dark clothes. -gayane: the third one was the one who came back. he wore a long brown coat. -diana: he wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. when they left, they told him downstairs that those women were armenians, and ran back and said that they were going to kill us. -zinaida: they had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and i closed the door. and then there is a knock. i told gaya, "take diana and go into the other room." my daughters went into the dining room, and i opened the door. there was a guy there who said, "run, hide! they're coming to kill you now!" we ran up to the third floor. we had some good neighbors up there, azerbaijanis. i sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. i was so far gone . . . out of a whole room i couldn't even think of anything to take. i even forgot to take my work documents; at the time i had been preparing a report to send to baku, and the documents were at home. i couldn't see anything . . . i could only see vika, my older daughter. i sent gaya and diana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, "should i close the door and leave everything like this?" he says, "what do you mean, door? get out of here, they're coming to kill you! what are you standing there for?" and i ran after the children. -gayane: we barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting, "where are the armenians?" we were already at the neighbors'. they had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, "don't you worry, i'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what." -zinaida: on the third floor there i started asking the folks, our neighbors, to go meet vika. the bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. i dissolved in tears, gaya was soothing me, diana was next to us, she was crying too, and i'm already thinking that i've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart i still believe she's alive . . . and my tears choked me. i was going out of my mind. but no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with people, swarming with them. from the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits, "where are those armenians, the ones who were at home? where did they make off to?" they told him they didn't know. they asked him where he lived. he answered, "can't you see, on the third floor." he asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. we heard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded. -gayane: mamma was crying the whole time. she fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling vika. she didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. her thoughts were only on vika. the neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, offering tea. -zinaida: we are very grateful to them. thanks to them my children and i are alive, well, and unharmed. when they were throwing our belongings out and burning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us and said, "how lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some other woman instead. you're from our part of the building you lost your husband, you have children, thank god you're not in her position, we wouldn't have been able to take it. i don't know what i would do." he of course wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. in the yard they were torturing our neighbors, fellow armenians they lived on the fifth floor, in the third entryway. a married couple, vanya and nina, and their three children. their last name is v. they hid their two daughters, and stayed with their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an axe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . they beat up the husband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning things; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. the crowd shouted, "look at the naked armenian!" they were going to throw the poor woman into the fire. the neighbors came out, an azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she covered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. all the neighbors saw and heard it . . . -gayane: mamma wouldn't allow it but i went to the window and saw her standing there, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body. our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as nina--she lives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, nina showed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was covered, riddled, with wounds. -zinaida: in the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one o'clock, two buses approached the station. i wanted to run out. by then i didn't care any more if i lived or died, but gayane wouldn't let me go, and the neighbors said that i would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their children. gaya was crying and said that i forgot about them, my other children, but i could only think of vika. i imagined her torn to pieces, i'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand i would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. i was going to do it but gayane wouldn't let me: "mamma, please! mamma, i beg of you!" the neighbors were sleeping and gayane woke them with her cries. so we held on that way till morning. on the morning of the 29th i told our neighbor i was going to go downstairs to our apartment, maybe vika was lying there, murdered. he told me he would go himself. he was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to me. he returned and said there was no one there, nothing. i went down too, stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. i didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away, farther than the bus station. i began looking for the briefcase with my work in it. i was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time because of my work. my documents were there, my travel papers--i worked in the transport division -- and my trip sheets. -gayane: mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job. -zinaida: i look around and i can't find the briefcase. i didn't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that everything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, i worried about that later, but at first i was concerned about the lost documents. i went into the kitchen. my daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and my earrings. it was all there. five minutes passed and gayane ran in and said, "mamma, hurry." and diana came downstairs too. gayane found her coat among the debris, and diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her dresses. -diana: immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us. they threw a television onto the asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. then, when vika wasn't there, i wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but i couldn't eat. because i loved vika terribly and she and i had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the park. when we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken, right away i started looking for my dolls and my books, but i didn't see anything. when we went back upstairs i managed to take two cups from my tea service, and gaya took vika's suit and one of her own dresses. my italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one that had been on top of the television. he was very large and very handsome. i had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a violin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other one were the letters a, b, c, d, e and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing. they were beautiful satchels. they were gone too. i had many books, i collected them, they were in the bedside tables. and a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday, they weren't around either. and i had some big books, fat ones, and they disappeared, only one was left, the malachite box. the adventures of karlson, pippi longstockings, and fairy tales of the world were left. all the other books were gone. -zinaida: i continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor arrived. he had waited for me until nine o'clock, but i didn't appear, and he thought something must have happened, so he came. he's a russian, aleksei semyonovich lomakin. alik aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. when they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. when i saw them i started crying. my azerbaijani neighbors came in. some of them were crying, others were helping me pick up. i go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. now that i remember it it's both funny and painful: how could i have thought that i had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? incidentally, later, when i went back to the apartment again those things were gone too. and the door was gone. after my supervisor left, in the afternoon, the neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. "i'm afraid," he said, "that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you and us too. my god, where could i go it was daytime and those . . . i don't even know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, i don't know what to call them, i can't find the words, they were everywhere. where should i go with two girls? when i opened the door i had tears in my eyes, and i was terrified . . . and he said, "go to alik's, he's an azerbaijani, too." and i say, "you should have said that earlier, when my supervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him." everyone feared for their own lives. what could i do? i went out into the entryway and stood. and he says, "any other time i would keep you here a year, or two. but right now, i'm sorry . . . " then another door opened, also on the third floor. i ask the neighbor, "tayara, can we hide at your place?" she's an azerbaijani too. she says, "what kind of question is that? come in!" she hid us. there were many people in the courtyard, and gaya and i hid in the wardrobe, and they put diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the child could breathe. tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out, and when they came back she would hide us again. we sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. gaya became ill, and i allowed her to get out. my legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. we hadn't eaten or drunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all of it just snapped in me. tayara's husband went outside, even though i begged him to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. he said that he'd be in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. she put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an azerbaijani family. my girls went to the window--and what was going on out there! i feared for my children, that someone would recognize them from the street. gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an azerbaijani, but directly across there was a 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and i shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. but she kept on looking. -diana: i watched too. -zinaida: downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. the soldiers didn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. i saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended themselves . . . i'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my children. when one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding i had to stop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . i imagined my children in their shoes . . . -gayane: the troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, block 36, and our microdistrict 3. but they only cordoned them off from the outside. the mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. they caught several azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. one fell down and they cracked open another's head . . . -zinaida: they show lebanon on television, and the war in afghanistan--that's just what it was like. like in america, how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard. -gayane: don't compare it with america, those were peaceful demonstrations, but these?! -zinaida: but how could it happen here and not off somewhere in america! they attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . then i thought, where's the tear gas that the americans use to disperse demonstrators? if they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered. -gayane: they would not have scattered. the soldiers had been there since morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. they hadn't eaten, they were fine standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired. they weren't even allowed to sit down . . . at noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and then the tables were turned. the mob went after the soldiers, the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields, and the azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them. and those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. and meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . they always say, "our children have never seen war." i never even dreamed about it, there was no need to. but then i thought about those people who had lived through a war. it was truly horrible . . . the guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their clubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were covered in blood . . . so many died! they beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields. and those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, they couldn't open fire. they couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. it's comical . . . -zinaida: what are you saying? how can it be funny? -gayane: no, i didn't mean that: how could something like that happen during our soviet period? it's painfully embarrassing! and they burned the armored personnel carriers, too. someone shouted, "get away, it's going to blow!" everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. the soldiers lost their senses. and when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk. -zinaida: the bus that had brought the troops. only the driver was in it. the bus ran over three people straight off, i saw it. and two armored personnel carriers ran over four more. all in one or two minutes. the bus ran over three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. right on our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one of the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over several over there, too. but they ran over seven before our eyes. then the bus ploughed into a book kiosk. -gayane: no, that was a flower place. it was a new booth. he drove straight into it. -zinaida: the driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on fire. -gayane: and i also saw the troops put a bunch of azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to baku. there were many arrests. -zinaida: our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his wife that we should leave. they were running around in the courtyard looking for the armenians. they knew that they were hiding with azerbaijanis, and they were saying that they were going to check the azerbaijani families. poor tayara got scared too, and started to cry; i pleaded with her, i said that i would remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we go? -gayane: she didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but she was afraid. -zinaida: i told tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at night we would return to our apartment. then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed. he says, "zina, you owe us a drink. gorbachev announced a curfew." and bagirov [first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in karabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there hadn't been any killings. he kept making statements, and there were azerbaijani songs and dances. tayara turned the tv all the way up. when we learned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again, a large one. our neighbor told them that there had been only one armenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one left. we hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck diana back under the bed. -gayane: tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and found two bandits. they asked her, "what are you doing here" tayara answered, "i came to take something for myself." "take all you want, they're gone now." -zinaida: yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. she said, "what are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children, nothing remains of your entire apartment." in short, we calmed down, and the crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. i don't know what went on there. -gayane: the curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse: they were warned that they would open fire on them. the soldiers didn't know the city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets, but didn't go into the courtyards. when we were at the city party committee they asked people from sumgait to go with them and show them the way. -zinaida: the tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th. -gayane: no, mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the city party committee, where the armenians were . . . after midnight, on march 1, when i had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, mamma said, "get your things together, they have sent buses for us." as it was we had been dressed the entire time. mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us. -zinaida: when i came back for the children tayara said that vika was alive and well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place. i both believed it and didn't believe it. we ran out to the tanks. the gambarians were there, roman and sasha; their father, shurik, the clarinetist, was killed, and their mother was there. sasha came over and asked about the girls. i was surprised, how did he know my girls? he said that he knew me and the girls. our neighbor himself went for gaya and diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so i went after him. another neighbor came out, anna vasilyevna, a russian: "zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck." she kissed diana. they put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the city party committee. the bus wouldn't start, so they put us on another one. it was pouring rain. -diana: when they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, and they all had clubs and shields. and when the azerbaijanis attacked them, many of the soldiers died. they threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the soldiers. i saw this myself. the soldiers ran over those azerbaijanis with the tanks. the soldiers saw that the azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage. we got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket, and gaya and mamma crawled into the wardrobe. and they were fighting right down there on the street . . . near the building they were blowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in the courtyard. they drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks. and when we left--it was evening, it was already dark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. mamma ran up and said, "get your clothes on, let's go." gaya was wearing slippers, and i had on my blue dress, but it was an old one. i was wearing my old jacket, my old dress, and slippers. and nothing else. gaya had on a skirt, her angora sweater, and slippers. it was raining hard, and there were puddles on the street. they gave mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved dress; she put it on and we ran out. we got onto the bus and i was hungry, one of the soldiers from yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to the other in his arms. i gave him the little glass that remained from vika's trousseau, and he gave me his telephone number. -gayane: in the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window. we had to be ready for anything. they took us to the city party committee, let us out, and then took us into the city party committee building under armed guard. it was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. we asked, "are these all us? armenians?" they answered yes. we were surprised that there were so many armenians in sumgait. all those years we lived there and didn't know there were so many armenians, 18,000. we were struck by that, we had never noticed. going downstairs the next day i ran into the secretary of the komsomol from vika's plant, the khimprom. he said that vika was alive and well. when i told mamma she of course calmed down some more. but you know, after all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was just gone. she didn't believe it completely. -zinaida: i didn't believe it because i had heard all kinds of things. when we arrived at the city party committee we heard everything imaginable! it was the fear of god. i saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were. many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. they had seen the broken windows. i cried, saying that i didn't know where vika was. one woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of them; the other had been slashed all over. a second said that her husband and her son had been murdered. that was nelli aramian. she lived in building 6 in our microdistrict. they killed her husband, armo, and her son artur. i heard so many things like that that i was already starting to lose touch; my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. later an azerbaijani fellow came to me and said, aunt zina, vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a safe place; if you want i'll call her there and you can speak with her. we went downstairs to the first floor and he called vika. i spoke with her, heard the voice of my child. she had managed to survive in that hell. then i started begging that azerbaijani to bring her to the city party committee. he tried to talk me out of it: "i'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, i've looked after her better than a brother does a sister." all the same i asked him to get her. he brought her and i calmed down. on the second day there was a meeting with demichev [member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr,] and people started shouting. one shouted, "give me my son back!", another yelled, "where is my daughter?!", a third wanted her husband . . . bagirov was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying anything. -gayane: when demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, "to russia!" to be honest we were all frightened of armenia, there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go to armenia. but he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them. and he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments. on march 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of nasosny. we were taken care of marvelously by the military. they sent special flights of children right from there to minvody, yerevan, and moscow. one woman left for moscow with a letter for gorbachev and gromyko. -zinaida: the worst was truly behind us by then. everything had passed, but the pain will remain for our whole lives. it cannot be forgotten. under no circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. who will answer for those who died? for our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and daughters? who will bear the responsibility? who will wash away their blood? someone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased . . . it isn't over yet, now we live here, in armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. we would like to stay in armenia, in our homeland, so that all the armenian people will be united. then we will be invincible. armenians won't be scattered throughout the soviet union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen again. as a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, i ask armenians to be united so that what happened in sumgait will never happen again. our homeland . . . the only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs. so that our children can work for the good of armenia. if we aren't able to, then let our children do it. and if it's possible, we'll work for the good of armenia too. this is the land of our forefathers. our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was only later that people dispersed all over. like a mother, the land here bore and reared us. it is our wife, and will protect us, too. i want but one thing: that our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your children here, in armenia, never see anything like it. may 28, 1988 yerevan 		 - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, pages 187-203 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal
so, mr. salah is still claiming stalin was a jew? this thread began on sca, when he and another guy claimed both stalin and lenin were jews. when i posted evidence from books and the britannica showing they were christians, someone made the (correct) remark that lenin's maternal grandfather was a jew who converted to christianity. to counter the fact that stalin was a christian who, during his youth, was trained to be a priest, mr. salah wrote "yes, it says he was trained to be a priest, but not for what religion!" (btw, stalin developed strong antisemitic feelings later in his life). mr. salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against jews by posting antisemitic forgeries and trying to "prove" that certain notorious people were jews, even if they were not. -danny keren.

i have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by this anti-israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable sounding name of the 'center for policy research.' obviously, it is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published documents to find material to use against israel makes it so. labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself. that is simply part of the propaganda process. i was curious if anyone knew who this anti-israel fanatic hiding behind his phoney 'research center' name is. is he an arab? is he some typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?' is he some jew who perhaps lived in israel and just couldn't make it there, and is now taking his failure out on israel? let's shed some light on this clown once and for all. it will help put his nonsense in the proper perspective. and the readers of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-israel hyperbola can ignore this junk.
news you may have missed, apr 19, 1993 not because you were too busy but because israelists in the us media spiked it. ................ those intrepid israeli soldiers israeli soldiers have sexually taunted arab women in the occupied gaza strip during the three-week-long closure that has sealed palestinians off from the jewish state, palestinian sources said on sunday. the incidents occurred in the town of khan younis and involved soldiers of the golani brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and occupied west bank. five days ago girls at the al-khansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``come and kiss me.'' when the girls fled, the soldiers threw empty bottles at them. on saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from al-khansaa walking home from school. parents are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school. the same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. deputy principal srur abu-jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them against a wall, and put their arms around them. when teacher hamdan abu-hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles. on tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by abdel azzim qdieh, a practising moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. qdieh refused, the soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the beating. on friday, soldiers entered the home of zamno abu-ealyan, 60, blindfolded him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. as the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. the coupled continued dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening. the army said it was checking the reports. .................... israeli troops bar christians from jerusalem israeli troops prevented christian arabs from entering jerusalem on thursday to celebrate the traditional mass of the last supper. two arab priests from the greek orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied west bank from jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter. ``right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the church of the holy sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said father george makhlouf of the ramallah parish. israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of palestinian attacks against jews. the closure cut off arabs in the west bank and gaza strip from jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre. father nicola akel said christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites. makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing jews free movement to take part in recent passover celebrations while restricting christian celebrations. ``yesterday, we saw the jews celebrate passover without any interruption. but we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said. an israeli officer interrupted makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave. ................... if you are as revolted at this as i am, drop israel's best friend email and let him know what you think. 75300.3115@compuserve.com (via compuserve) clintonpz@aol.com (via america online) clinton-hq@campaign92.org (via mci mail) tell 'em arf sent ya. .................................. if you are tired of "learning" about american foreign policy from what is effectively, israeli controlled media, i highly recommend checking out the washington report. a free sample copy is available by calling the american education trust at: (800) 368 5788 tell 'em arf sent you. js

elias davidsson the following proposal is based on the following assumptions: 1. fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states. 2. in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail. 3. between the collectivities defining themselves as jewish-israeli and palestinian-arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists. 4. this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. it moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations. 5. each year, the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties. 6. attempts to solve the israeli-arab conflict by traditional political means have failed. 7. as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible. 8. love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. when people love, they share. having stated my assumptions, i will now state my proposal. 1. a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli-jew and the other palestinian-arab. 2. to be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner, although born in areas under current isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return. 3. for the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. for the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. for each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child. 4. the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeli-arab conflict, including the u.s. government, jewish and christian organizations in the u.s. and a great number of governments and international organizations. 5. the emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in israel/palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. the existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle-east in a graceful manner. objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. i will attempt to identify some of these: 1. the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. however, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation. 2. it may be objected that the israeli-palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. this objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not zionism as ideology and practice, but israeli-jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above) 3. fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. from their point of view, the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights. the president of the world jewish congress, edgar bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel, a german magazine. he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the holocaust. this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above) 4. it may objected that only a few people in israel/palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes. 5. it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. this objection has merits. however, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the united states government and by u.s. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middle-east through armaments. a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in israel/palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land. i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment. elias davidsson post box 1760 121 reykjavik, iceland

what's happened?" they say, "armenians, get out of here!" we don't open the door, we say, "if we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow." they say, "no, leave now, get out of here, armenian dogs, get out of here!" by now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. we hold them off as best we can, my father and i on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. we had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. they broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. no neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. we held the door. they started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an axe, and then with a crowbar. when the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--sasha hit one of them with the axe. the axe flew out of his hands. they also had axes, crowbars, pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. one of them hit my father in the head. the pressure from the mob was immense. when we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. my brother sasha and i fought back, of course. sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of sumgait. we had hammers in our hands, and we injured several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. but they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them. the door fell down at an angle. the mob tried to remove the door, so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw father bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, and his whole face was bloody. we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. we came out on the landing, but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there, having closed the door behind them. we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. then a man, an imposing man of about 40, an azerbaijani, came in. when he was coming in, father fell down and mother flew to him, and started to cry out. i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. we live on the fourth floor. and no one came. i went into the room. it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani: "what's with you, woman, why are you shouting? what happened? why are you shouting like that?" she says, "what do you mean, what happened? you killed somebody!" my father was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, armenian and azerbaijani, he played for many years. everyone knew him. mother says, "the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings, he brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person." he says, "you don't need to shout, stop shouting." and when they heard the voice of this man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. we chased after them, but they ran away. that man left, too. as we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, i don't know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. we raced to father and started to massage his heart, but it was already too late. we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. the ambulance never came, although we waited for it all evening and all through the night. somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. they informed us they were from khachmas. they said, "we heard that a group was here at your place, you have our condolences." they told us not to touch anything and left. father lay in the room. so we stayed home. each of us took a hammer and a knife. we sat at home. well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy, investigators. they say, "leave everything just how it is, we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything." then people came from the republic procuracy too, but no one helped us take father away. the morning came and the neighbors arrived. we wanted to take father away somehow. we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. we called an ambulance, and nobody came. then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. we secured the door somehow or other. we left father in the room and went up to the neighbor's. the excesses began again in the morning. the bandits came in several vehicles, zil panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. our building was located right there. a crowd formed. then they started fighting with the soldiers. then, in buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking into armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. the armenians weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. and again they poured in the direction of our building. they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. "they're up there, still, up there. let's go kill them!" they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. we were hiding one floor up. something heavy fell. sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father, they had thrown father, were defiling the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. i heard it, and the sound was kind of hollow, and i said, "no, that's from some of the furniture." mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed him down. the mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. they were also armenians, they had left for another city. the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, "are you crazy? why are you hiding armenians? don't you now they're checking all the apartments? they could kill you and them!" and to us :" . . . come on, leave this apartment!" we went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. at first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. we stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. we heard the sound of motors. the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. we went downstairs. there was a light on in the room where we left father. in the other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. they left only one bulb. the bulb was burning, which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom. with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved. our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. well, we fought, but we were only able to save mother. we couldn't save father. we inflicted many injuries on the bandits, some of them serious. but others came to take their places. we were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. it was a miracle we survived. we were saved by a miracle and the troops. and if troops hadn't come to sumgait, the slaughter would have been even greater: probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide. through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. we went to ' pick up father's corpse. we took it to the morgue. this was about two o'clock in the morning, it was already march 1, it was raining very hard and it was quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. there were about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. it was gruesome. i suffered a tremendous shock. there were about ten people there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku. there was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. it was something terrible. the morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. there was a man there, too, several men. you couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured, they were in such awful condition... now two and a half months have passed. every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait. every day: my father, and the death of my father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue. i still want to say that 70 years have passed since soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait. it will go down in history. i'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. they even fought the soldiers. many soldiers were wounded. the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. they weren't afraid. they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. i saw the clashes on february 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. and that mob was fighting with the soldiers. the inhabitants of some of the buildings, also azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. they weren't afraid of them. i say they were sure of their impunity. when we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes. and they told me that they knew that they were being burned. during those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid. no one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us. as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus station. rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. so i think all of it was arranged in advance. they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. you can tell that the "operation" was planned in advance. thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us, thanks to the russian people, because the majority of the troops were russians, and the troops suffered losses, too. i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians, and in the name of all sumgait armenians. for coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time. at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy. i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could happen again. everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds. very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass disturbances. the mobs were huge. at present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, i think, judging by the newspaper reports. there were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all. they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts. may 18, 1988

in article <1483500368@igc.apc.org> center for policy research <cpr@igc.apc.org> writes: % %by elias davidsson - april 1991 (revision oct. 1991) note - you are already posting "facts", some of which are outdated. the biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a "meeting of the minds". it is to those who read with open mind, that i address myself. %the international convention on the elimination of all forms of %racial discrimination adopted by the general assembly of the %united nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member %states. article 1 of this convention defines the term racial %discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, %social, cultural or any other field of public life." while the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. it makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation. %the general assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. the %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli %racial discrimination. meanwhile the united states, on behalf of %israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united %nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial %practices - zionism - moral legitimacy. if you are, in principle, advocating un intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited. scarey thought. %the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native %non-jews born in that country. actually, i know quite a few native non-jews born in israel that are not alienated by this law. if you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent. this slant permeates the text. %practically all non-jews who are living in or originate from areas %under israeli control, identify themselves as palestinians. most %of them are muslim, many are christian. a few jews, including the %author of these lines, also identify themselves as palestinians. the above statement is not true. practically all - discounting beduins, circassians, druze, and some other fringe groups. your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue. you could equally identify yourself as a [insert group]. %zionism took off in europe at the end of last century. it's aim %was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of palestinian arabs (95% of the population). if i recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, there was no adamant opposition in palestine. i am open to any factual contradictory evidence . %but the %zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of mandatory palestine. after driving into exile most native %arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and %razing most of their villages to the ground, the zionists could %finally establish a predominantly jewish state. only 150,000 %non-jews remained on israeli territory. do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "most of their villages"? %once the jewish state was established, it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-jews, their %political repression and their destitution. there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes. however, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda. my knowledge was that this was not the case. you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this. as you do again, below. %in 1967 the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied %the rest of palestine (the west bank and the gaza strip). thus %another 1.5 million palestinians fell under its juridiction. its %occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community, as reflected in security %council resolutions. israel has rejected all u.n. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time. not quite accurate. israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. israel never annexed the sinai, west bank, or gaza. the other annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions. %part of these territores, east jerusalem and the golan heights, %have already been forcefully annexed by israel, in defiance of %international law and un resolutions. out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war? has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than iraq) ? %it must be emphasized that, although these people live under %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as %palestinians, that is as people identifying with palestine, a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity). incorrect! palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an "ethnic or racial" basis. therefore your above statement is incorrect. i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. however, no such nation has existed. it definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period! %furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs. once again, some do, some don't. %the non-jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab %territories occupied by israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation. another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people, whose cause you espouse. %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court. incorrect once again. they have the ability to appeal. furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary. some are, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization. %only jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms. incorrect once again. i know two arab policemen who lived in daheisha and there were more. of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly. %jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-jews. jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. it is israel %governmentus policy to increase this number substantially, in %total defiance of international law, un resolutions and the will %of the population. the state of israel systematically confiscates %land from non-jewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish %settlement. that is no longer true, and i can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this. %some 800,000 people in israel proper,are not jews. most of them %consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship. for %many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. much of their land was confiscated by %the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish %settlement. they have been subject to massacres, destitution and %humiliation. while they enjoy, with jewish israelis, the right to %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice. once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right? their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, abu gosh comes to mind. yes, some did but as a result of what actions? %approximately 92% of the surface of the state of israel within the %rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are %second-class citizens in israel. they may neither legally live on %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. a direct effect of these %policies is that native non-jewish citizens of israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. non-jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: the government %starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of %funds; jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos; %jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-jewish neighbors, palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to jewish schools); palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities. 1. there are some kibbutzim with arab/non-jewish members. it is up to the members of the kibbutz. there is no legislation against it, nor against a purely non-jewish collective. 2. funds are the result of political lobbying. bearing in mind that non_jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc, and increase their power. the recent elections are a case in point. 3. please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material. you have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank. it is based upon jordan's school system. 4. with regard to your last statement, it is simply another gross generalization. %the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of %all its inhabitants. although the israeli cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native palestinian population, that is, its %ultimate judaization), israeli government policies towards %non-jews bear the mark of this 'final solution'. no attempt is %made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs %into israeli public life. thus, although comprising approximately %17% of the population of israeli citizens, no palestinian citizen %of israel has ever served as cabinet member, as director of %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the supreme %court, as ambassador of israel, or in any leading position in %israeli economic or financial life. even the director of the %ministry for arab affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a jew. another generalization, but lets not stop here. the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, moledet. it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself. with regard to other items, i recall at least one arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously. %although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of jews and non-jews are legal, %they are considered by israeli/zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the jewish and zionist ethics. the israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way. when was the last time you were in israel? that is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time. the question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one. %zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on %equality of all citizens. this is one main reason why israel has %not produced any written constitution. simply incorrect. the answer is political. once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines. %zionism predicates a state %where jews have privileged rights. thus, according to israeli law, %a jew born in london, who has never visited israel, does not speak %hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic israeli %citizenship, while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %christian or muslim, are treated almost as aliens. racial %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only %reflected in israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the %very nature of israel as a jewish state. but the discrimination is not based upon race. oops, sorry, nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths. %any proposal for israeli-arab and israeli-palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel - %that is the zionist nature of the state of israel - is thus doomed %to fail. real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. of course, i wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your view of things. let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?! i may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the amount of patience i have for rubbish at 02:00. -- shai guday | stealth bombers, os software engineer | thinking machines corp. |	the winged ninja of the skies. cambridge, ma |

"in one case - the zahran family - only one out of twenty five survived. in another house they caught the sixteen year old son fuad. his mother was holding him. they killed him with a knife. the mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital. a young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street. their bodies were left there. they moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard, as soon as anybody opened his door. they were using bombs [grenades], machine-guns, submachine-guns. my cousin escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes. one of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards, killing everybody who moved. they killed my uncle, ali hassan zeidan, and my aunt fatima. she heard him call 'help me'. she ran to him and they killed her. another neighbour haj yarah, heard some voices and came out. they killed him too. his son muhammad, who was about seventeen, heard his father call him and went to the same place. they killed him. his mother heard her son cry for help. she ran out and they killed her. that was near my house. i saw this" muhammad arif sammour funny how 'myths and facts' does not see fit to include this too - after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events? what do you say about this harry?

(no, i'm not exaggerating. and i really don't want to discuss how.) note that a million dead gazans don't get much more headline space than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once exterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines. so if a "final solution" for gaza would be so much better from a *realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't israel go for it? a difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything good about jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit the facts into the theory. --- d. c. sessions speaking for myself --- --- note new network address: dcs@witsend.tnet.com --- --- author (and everything else!) of tmail (dos mail/news shell) ---

arab citizens have the all the same rights as jews. arabs are exempt from military service, but that is about it. arabs have a full voice in israeli politics, to the degree that they choose to get involved. they may vote. there are arabs in the cabinet. the claim that israel is an apartheid state is a racist claim, one which is based on a total disregard for the facts and a total hatred for israel.

(i admit that many religious jews would argue that i am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but judaism is a religion of dissent and debate isn't it?). the fact that one can opt to become jewish simply by converting to judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation. we have no quotas! so i will once again make my point. defining a member of the jewish nation by religion (not, as you say, religious belief) is not racism. you come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism. -adam schwartz
	+-----------------------------------------------------------+ 	| | 	| "there's no room for christians here!" and "when we | 	| finish with the armenians, we'll go after the russians!" | 	| | 	+-----------------------------------------------------------+ deposition of karine borisovna melkumian [1] born 1963 teacher boarding school no. 1 resident at building 2b, apartment 21 block 41a sumgait [azerbaijan] this is my fate: i had everything, we were a happy family, and now, at 25, i've become a widow, i'm left to raise my three children alone; the third, not yet two months old, was born in yerevan. igor and i had thought that if it was a girl we would call her raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, we'd call him arsen, after igor's grandfather. i had a girl, and i, without igor, named her raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother. our family and the melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. igor and i grew up together, we were friends from childhood on. we got engaged when i was 16. in 1981, when i was 18, we were married. two children were born to us in sumgait. my daughter is now 6 years old, her name is kristina, and my son, seryozha, is four and a half. first i shall tell what happened on february 27. that day on my way home from work i passed lenin square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. there were komsomol members there, and pioneers [children's organization], and there were both party members and non-party people there as well. all of them were shouting, "there's no room for christians here!" and "when we finish with the armenians, we'll go after the russians!" and some even cried out, "death to the armenians!" absurd rumors had been circulating about town. i became frightened. i came home, breathless, and told about everything i had seen downtown. my family couldn't believe it. my father-in-law sogomon markovich melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an azerbaijani wedding. by eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock. he got out of the car but there was no one there. well i was telling him everything, too, and he said, "what, is there no longer any government?" that same day igor said, "papa, something terrible is happening in the city." and he said, "we'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our own home." the day passed. on february 28, that was sunday, we didn't go out. we called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the same thing. sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an armenian from the neighboring building. ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and i called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. we called and called, and nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything. on february 29, on monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were afraid to go to work. i called the school: i had the keys to the classroom. i told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, i wouldn't be coming in. he agreed, and even said, "fine, don't come in, we understand what's going on in town, don't come in." before that, on the 28th, the ambartsumian family came over. they came to my father-in-law and said, "uncle sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are happening in town." uncle misha ambartsumian even said, "with my own eyes i saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. i don't know," he said, "we should leave town." well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. we got a couple of bags together, clothes, food, the bare essentials. and then somewhere around 4:45 the building manager came by and said, "uncle sergey, the situation in town is bad, don't go out." my father even opened up to him and said, "maybe we'll drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there." "no," he said, "it'll be worse there, you'll be safer at home." he said don't be afraid, if something happens i'll send people to save you. after he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard. all of us were at home at the time: igor and i and our two children, ira and edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law ira, and my mother-and father-in-law. and the ambartsumian family, there were three of them, uncle misha, zhasmen, and their daughter marina. now when they started breaking down the door i remember edik and igor told us, "go in that room and close the door. close the door and calm the children so they won't hear that there's anyone home." the children started crying. suddenly ira, my brother-in-law's wife, suggested, "let's run out onto the balcony." we -- the two daughters-in-law and the children, and zhasmen and marina -- raced out onto the balcony. my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, "quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all." we lived on the second floor. we needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. at first we couldn't manage it. the balcony looked onto the street. at that time people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. i pleaded and begged: "please, call someone, have someone come!" i even started shouting. "i'll throw down the children, i'll throw them down, you catch them and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive." either they were afraid or . . . i don't know what. they looked as though they were watching a movie. some of them started throwing stones at us. i'll say it again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. a bus even stopped. i remember a man's voice saying the armenians were climbing over to the other balcony. ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children over there. i was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. no, it wasn't yet seven, it was six and a half. i climbed over too. i think zhasmen went first; you know, i just don't remember it all that well. zhasmen went first, i think, and edik's wife ira and i had the children, and they were all screaming and crying. my kristina said, "mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're afraid!" lilia was crying, and kristina and seryozha were crying too. kristina didn't even want to climb over. she shouted, "i'm staying with grandmother, i'm staying with grandma!" she loved her grandma, more than she loved me. and my mother-in-law shouted, "oh no, kristina's still there, she's still there, save kristina, too!" ira helped us climb over, with kristina coming last. ira helped us and went back inside. we started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. i pounded with my fist, sevil, open the door, open it, please!" she didn't open it. "no, go away, go anywhere, go, i'm not opening the door." she was our neighbor, we were friends, we never refused her anything, ever! and apparently she thought we were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. she opened it and said, "karina, karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll kill us, too, because of you." i begged, "please, at least take the children, we'll leave, we'll go back." "no," she said, "you have to leave." her sons ran in, one had a knife. sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: "get out of here, leave, i'll kill you with this knife!" i became terrified, i took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. i went down and heard a loudspeaker. it was in the courtyard "the armenians must be killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!" one of them said, "let the armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!" when i heard that i went upstairs and started knocking on doors. no one opened their door for me! not on the third floor, or the fourth. i couldn't see zhasmen any longer. ira came upstairs later. i even thought that they had let her stay, that they would save her. my head was spinning. they were killing my family, and here i was in the next entryway with two children. seryozha was four, and kristina was five and a half. they were crying, "mamma, we're scared!" they were so frightened that i didn't even know how to calm them, should i try to calm them or myself? it was awful. but on the third floor a man did open his door. i asked, "open up, let me inside!" he opened the door slightly and said, "no!" "no" and that was it! he said it so sternly: "no!" i went up to the fifth floor. i pounded my fists on the door with all my might. he opened up, the man of the house, and stood there, looking at me. i was ready to get down on my knees. i almost did get down on my knees. "please, i beg of you, at least take the children." he wasn't an azerbaijani, he was a lezgin. i don't even know how, but he let me inside. and when i went in, zhasmen was already there. two minutes hadn't passed when ira and lilia came up the stairs. lilia was crying. he didn't want to open the door. and again i started pleading, "please, open the door, it's our ira and lilia! open the door!" and he said, "no, i'm afraid." i said again and again, "please, open the door, please!" he looked at me. he looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all. ira came in with lilia. we threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. then the man locked us into the bathroom. we sat there for a long time. through the door he told us, "calm the children, and calm yourselves down, too." calm down? this man was hiding us, but what of our family? when i was still in our apartment i had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. i said, "igor, edik, let's say farewell." and edik turned around and looked at me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? all the same i thought they would kill all of us. igor looked at me, too . . . but it was already too late! they started pounding on the door, igor was standing next to the door. before that he had told us, "go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight." he thought we were in the room. but before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: "edik, igor, let's say farewell." igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony. and we did get over there, and i myself can't believe we were able to save ourselves. igor put on a helmet, and edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. all the men--igor, edik, their father, and misha ambartsumian--they all stood next to the door. they thought they would pound on it a while and leave. but from the other side of the door they ordered in azerbaijani: "open the door!" we were all silent, waiting. someone outside the door said, "they're home, they're in there, break down the door!" and i remember my father-in-law whispering, "they're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . " he had something in his hands, i think it was a knife: if they got in, we were going to defend ourselves. in the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs. from outside the door they said, "we're counting to five, open up!" but we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. we made like no one was home. we figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. my father-in-law had said, "it's not possible they'd come into my home. how can that be? everyone knows us, all of sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with everyone." and indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an azerbaijani guest at our table. we had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there often, azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. but now we had to save ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. ira, i remember, said, "i'm not leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, i'm going to fight alongside them." that's just what she said. she picked up a knife and said, "if they open the door and come into the apartment then i'm going to fight alongside my family, i'm not going anywhere." we were at sevil's when they broke into our apartment. we heard fighting and shouting. the noise was terrible. and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. even ira's voice. i remember her calling her mother several times. she called her for a long time . . . i started pounding on the door in the bathroom: "open the door, what are they doing to ira, who's shouting, that's ira shouting, that's her voice!" but the lezgin said, "it's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in your apartment." he was lying to me so i'd calm down. two hours went by and the lezgin opened the door and said, "karina, igor got away, calm down. he ran away." he saw igor break away and run off with his own eyes. they killed him outside, next to the building. while we were in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror. the way ira shouted! she shouted, "save me, mamma, save me! . . . mamma, mamma!" she repeated it several times. there was a wild din. there were very many people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like. apparently, after they had killed ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. i don't know if they were just looking for any armenians or for us in particular, but i think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law were climbing over the balconies. and after we heard ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. i thought those were our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. they were sleeping. i woke them up: "kristina! seryozha, wake up!" and i tell ira: "ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony." we were on the fifth floor. apparently our lezgin neighbor had opened the door too, because later he said, "i opened the door and told them there were no armenians inside." and after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see: they were gone. we weren't friends with those lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from the building. but the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding us. the lezgin let us out of the bathroom. they had a candle burning. he said, "karina, there're no lights on in our block." the whole block was dark, the whole block! it's a huge block, too. the lezgin said, "i'm afraid to keep you until morning, i'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving you." i said, "what are you saying, we'll leave now. but we can't just leave with the children in the middle of the night. give us time to find somewhere else to hide." he said, "well ok, go look." i asked ira, "ira, do you want to go?" ira said, "no, i'll stay with the children, karina." i said, "fine, then i'll go." zhasmen and i went downstairs together. it was very dark. no one was in the courtyard. it was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at after seven, igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, i never went out alone. and now here i was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that, too. it was probably after eleven. later i called the boarding school and my director answered. he said, "karina, where are you?" i didn't know, i was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where i was. i got confused and hung up the receiver. from him i only found out what time it was, i asked him, "what time is it?" he said 11:20, i think, but i don't really remember. so anyway zhasmen and i went out into the courtyard. i look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. and there was the smell of something burnt. i became horrified. i looked at the corpse for a long time. it was either ira or edik. i only saw one of them, zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it: "hurry up, let's go . . . hurry up, come on, what are you turning around for?" i turned around and saw a large truck, it must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck like that. we lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the fourth. we walked quickly, holding hands. i thought, if i go to the police then they'll put me away. i couldn't count on them. before i reached the police station i saw a military vehicle. we went over and i said, "soldier, in block 41, i don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to save them!" and he said, "go to the police station and tell them everything." i said, "i'm afraid to go there, i'm afraid of them." he said, "don't be afraid." we went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military vehicle went to our building. i didn't go with them, they left me at the police station. i gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them, too. i didn't know where they were or what had happened to them. after a while they brought my children and ira and lilia. first they took us to the kgb, that was at two or three in the morning. then around five they took us to the city party committee, and there were very many people there, very many. i was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. seryozha was only wearing a shirt, and kristina had a little dress on. no coat, no boots, nothing! and we sat there for three whole days in the city party committee. the lezgin had told me that igor escaped. and i thought that he was probably alive. but then after two and a half days, they took us, the armenians of sumgait, to nasosny. on march 6 some people from the central committee came and told us, "karina, ira, we need you, come with us to the city party committee." my mamma had come to nasosny, and she had been looking for me for six days. mama, my brothers, and my uncle. we went to the city party committee and waited there in the courtyard. i was wearing nothing but a dress, and ira had only a dress on as well. there was a strong wind on march 6. an hour went by. and then one of the functionaries told us, "karina, ira, gather your courage. would you like to go to the burial?" i said, "what, did they really kill all of them?!" he said, "let's look." he had a long list, and he started reading them off: igor melkumian, my husband, eduard melkumian, my brother-in- law, irina melkumian, my sister-in-law, sogomon melkumian, my father-in-law, and raisa melkumian, my mother-in-law. he read off all their names and said, "get in the car, let's go to the burial." we buried our family. i couldn't believe it at the time, i couldn't conceive of it or imagine it . . . and even now i think how shall i explain it to my children when they're older? my children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother. kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother, they spoiled her. kristina would always announce, "my grandma is better than anyone!" now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's difficult for her, and once she told her: "you're a bad grandmother." i don't know why, i asked her, "kristina, where's papa?" and she said, "they killed him." she knows, she understands it all. and recently i scolded seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, "when papa comes i'm going to tell him everything!" july 26, 1988 nairi boarding house near the village of arzakan hrazdan district armenian ssr 			- - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan, volume i, eyewitness accounts_, edited by samuel shahmuradian, forward by yelena bonner, 1990, published by aristide d. caratzas, ny, page 318-324 -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal

i think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute racial discrimination. these criteria are to be found for example in the 1. international convention for abolition of all forms of racial discrimination (ratified by most countries) 2. the international covenant of political and civil rights 3. the human rights charter 4. the european convention of human rights if one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is obvious that the state of israel is guilty of racial discrimination. the people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the zionist regime are the palestinian refugees, some of whom live under israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora. they are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not jews. international law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance. israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. by allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in tel in any area of the state of israel, the state would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. it would facilitate the peaceful integration of israel into the middle-east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent jewish presence - in the area. any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the israeli jewish and palestinian arab communities, is fraught with genociadal implications. i hope that u.s. jews, who sincerely wish that peace prevail in israel/palestine, will finally realize this fact. elias davidsson ps: please read carefully the first post in this topic, where the facts of zionist racial discrimination are described.

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: labour's enclaves policy.important labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by israel shahak publ. in middle east international, london, 30.4.93 it is not difficult to discover israel's policy towards the palestinians at any given time. it can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the hebrew press. there is one condition, though. the torrents of claptrap about "the peace process" must be totally ignored, as must israel's official pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. by concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent that labour's policies were no different from those of shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation. likud's policies were accurately described by ariel sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in yediot aharonot last august. the sharon plan envisaged a division of the west bank into seven, and the gaza strip into four, "autonomous" palestinian enclaves, all of them under israeli supervision. the total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories. the rest was to be controlled by the israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. the entire area around jerusalem, from the outskirts of ramallah to the boundaries of bethlehem, has already been turned into a "greater jerusalem" where the arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by israeli settlements or reserved for them. judging from labour's settlement policy, it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of arab enclaves of a rather larger size than sharon had planned. but the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged. labour plans only four enclaves in the west bank: two in "samaria" and two in "judea" (i.e. north and south of jerusalem respectively), and no more than two in the gaza strip. in regard to "greater jerusalem", labour's policies hardly deviate from sharon's. a saner version of likud policy as some israeli correspondents at once realised, labour policies were but a saner version of sharon's extravaganza. last july, gideon eshet wrote in yediot aharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the green line, "no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken". and uzi benziman wrote in ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in jerusalem, rabin intends to stick to likud's ways". the two biggest enclaves envisaged by labour are located in "samaria". therefore the belt of settlements around the "trans-samaria highway", designed to separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount importance. according to the latest data, the percentage of israeli settlers in the entire west bank population (apart from east jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. but for the area around the "trans-samaria highway", the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is increasing steadily. the situation in the settlements of the "efrat block" south of jerusalem, designed to sever the enclave around bethlehem from the one around hebron, is pretty much the same. the "efrat block" is now being connected with west jerusalem by a highway. the project is costly in the extreme, because the highway is designed to bypass bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels. the final decision to build this highway was suspended until rabin's return from his us visit in march. the subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as us approval for the enclaves plan as a whole. process of impoverishment the enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the palestinians. this is well known in israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned, including the plo. in regard to the gaza strip, the whole process was best described by ze'ev shiff in ha'aretz in march. he mentions having seen "a pamphlet issued six years ago by the civil administration forecasting the conditions in the gaza strip under israeli rule in 2000". his analysis deserves to be quoted extensively: "we continue to steal the strip's water, even though its quality deteriorates from year to year. we continue to steal the strip's tiny land resources, in order to found there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. it is by our own doing that the strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working. from the military point of view, we have kept control of no more than half the strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources. about a year before moshe arens left the defence ministry, i heard him saying that we should withdraw from the strip come what may. his argument was that israel sinks into the strip ever deeper and deeper. he told me he had proposed this to yitzhak shamir but he rejected it." yitzhak rabin rejects it too. enormous state support for the qatif block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented. the qatif block settlements, founded by the first rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to divide the gaza strip into two separate enclaves. efraim davidi of davar had data showing how vital for israeli this enterprise is. "the qatif block is now producing 40 per cent of israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a substantial proportion of cut flowers." he also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably augmented by the present government. owing to them, housing units are cheap. the present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. "any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels ($6,500)." such data shows that israel's plans apply whether the palestinians of the gaza strip are allowed or forbidden to work in israel. the economic motivations were explained by danny rubinstein in ha'aretz in march: "from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the strip's workers could be barred from entering israel...even though accurate data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of gazan workers arriving daily to work in israel has markedly decreased, from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. but the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering israel from gaza. it is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for gazan labour in israel. with unemployment in israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted, the workers from gaza are no longer really needed..." gaza's total dependence the entire economy of the gaza strip is totally dependent on israel. in recent years in the gaza strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for israeli factories, mostly footware and textiles. thousands of small workshops, employing an average of four workers, get their raw materials or unfinished products, together with detailed working instructions, from israeli factories. rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that "the average wage in the gaza strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the west bank, which in turn stands at half the average wage in israel; and besides the gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees." if the average wage in the gaza strip is just a fifth of that in israel, the profits of israeli factories and even of palestinian sub-contractors must be vast. they are higher still when "a gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home, with the family's help. the livelihood of tens of thousands of gazans depends on such sub-contracted work." many of them are women and children, paid about ten shekels ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. there can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of rabin and other israeli ministers to withdrawal from the strip. economic conditions in the gaza strip differ little from what was created straight after israel's conquest [in 1967]. in this respect, one should not be deluded by the talk, nowadays fashionable, about israeli gestures intended to "encourage economic development in the territories", as israeli journalists point out, all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the shin bet. "behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not become rebellious, and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis, its economic interests included," wrote michal sela in davar in february. the development of sub-contracted work in the gaza strip accords perfectly with sela's diagnosis. sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. "in all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing israeli production from the threat of any palestinian competition. the method is simplicity itself. as soon as any israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government, or even the trade and industry minister alone, a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to israel. if this does not suffice, a palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production." among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one. it has succeeded in limiting exports of gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) not only to israel but also to europe, where they otherwise might compete with israeli exports. perpetuaring apartheid labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories. the same goal is shared by the us, which otherwise could not support the labour government so firmly. in my view one of the reasons the us feels happier about supporting labour than likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. this point was brought home by ofer shelah in ma'ariv, who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth "occured during the term of office of the national unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which rabin served throughout as the defence minister". likud's reputation for settling the territories better than labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under shamir for symbolic reasons. to sum up: labour's policy, unconditionally supported by the us differs from that of likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented. according to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts. the major part is to be ruled by israel directly, and the minor part indirectly. in my view, this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying price in human suffering. the sooner its true nature is recognised, the less suffering it may cause. ************************************

"if there are jews on the tape, then i don't know what to say. i am speaking from experience when i say that those who remained in ethiopia are christians. i know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties, and there is no connection between them and reality." "what interested parties ?" "ethiopian immigrants who want their christian relatives to come here." "what to you recommend that ethiopian children in israel do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in ethiopia ?" "i ask if it is the job of the state of israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in ethiopia. well, my answer is that it is not. it would be a better solution, economically as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to ethiopia and reunite with his family there." ***************************************** publ. by the other front, alternative information center jerusalem, israel 28 april 1993

los angeles times, saturday, may 8, 1993. page a11. figure in adl spy case arrested at s.f. airport espionage: former police officer is taken into custody upon arriving from philippines, where he had fled after fbi interrogation. by jenifer warren, times staff writer san francisco -- a former san francisco police officer who fled to the philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the anti-defamation league was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police said friday. thomas j. gerard who abruptly left the united states in october after the fbi questioned him about his activities, was apprehended thursday night after a source in the philippines told investigators that gerard was returning home. gerard, 50, was booked into san francisco county jail early friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy. if convicted on all charges, gerard could face 16 years in prison and $40,000 in fines. bail was initially set at $250,000 after police argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. a friend of gerard was trying to post bail late friday afternoon, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. gerard returned to the united because he missed his wife and child, with whom he lived on a houseboat in sausalito, and "wanted to have his day in court," said police capt. john willett, his former boss and one of two arresting officers. gerard, an undercover agent for the central intelligence agency from 1982 to 1985, also feared that the cia was out to kill him, willett said. in an interview with the times last month, gerard threatened to disclose illegal cia support of death squads in central america if he was indicted and tried on the san francisco spying charges. gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the anti-defamation league, a prominent jewish civil rights organization. investigators allege that gerard illegally gave criminal histories to roy bullock, a san francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover adl intelligence operative for 40 years. investigators said they found confidential police files in bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment. files have also been seized under search warrants from adl offices in san francisco and los angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents. gerard could not be reached for comment friday, and his attorney, james lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. in the interview with the times last month, however, gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with bullock, but denied any criminal wrongdoing. bullock and gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to south africa. adl officials have described bullock as a $550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity. on friday, adl lawyer jerrold ladar said gerard's arrest "has nothing to do with adl. other than that, we have no comment on the case." arab-american groups -- which were a main target of the spying, according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation. "we urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of adl and law enforcement involvement," said james zogby, head of the arab american institute in washington. police, meanwhile, characterized gerard's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough. a former police colleague of gerard, inspector fred mollat, visited gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home. "i knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but we didn't think it would happen this quickly," capt. willett said. "this development really speeds up our timetable on the case." during his 25-year career on the police force, gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence division. his last assignment was on the gang task force. after fbi agents questioned gerard last fall, he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of palawan, 300 miles south of manila. gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his philippines airlines flight. he was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus, police said. "he was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked look on his face," willett said. "then he said, 'hello, i'm back.'" -- yigal arens usc/isi tv made me do it! arens@isi.edu

[...] the judges in the case were [...] barak, goldberg, and matza. when they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators agreed to talk. deputy state attorney rachel sukkar[sp?] was placed in charge of investigating the affair. she [...] questioned the directors of all shabak divisions. she investigated only the matter of the death in gaza prison. she discovered that not only torture, but also "the culture of lies", which judge landau had described in his report of two years before, were still very much in existence. nothing had changed. the report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among them the prime minister, the people at the top of the judicial system and judge landau. the director of shabak claimed that he did not know. after all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people. the system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation. one of shabak's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position. . . . ["the culture of lies" referred to above is the shabak interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation. the landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession. the fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that shabak is not sticking to the "approved" torture methods. -- yigal] -- yigal arens usc/isi tv made me do it! arens@isi.edu

"we were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'i don't believe you," i said, but followed to a nail-studded door. the man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. i thought i should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. all looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted, as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone, so i'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals." p. 363 (first paragraph).

'thank you for a lot, dro,' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must leave.'...we shook hands, the captain said 'a bientot, mon camarade.' and for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains. like lot's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'" p. 354.

"it will be three hours to take," dro told me. we'd close in on three sides. "the men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. "that is for morale," dro put in. "we must keep the moslems in terror." "soldiers or civilians?" i asked. "there is no difference," said dro. "all are armed, in uniform or not." "but the women and children?" "will fly with the others as best they may." p. 360. "the ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'djul lies under that,' said dro, pointing. 'our men also attack from the other sides.' then, 'whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. bayonets clicked upon carbines. over plunged archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though i heard our utica brass roar. as i watched from the height, it took ages for djul to show clear. a tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. the came a shrill wailing. now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. a mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. shots wasted, i thought, when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb." p. 361 (fourth paragraph). "corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. the bayonet had gone through her back, i judged, for blood around was scant. between the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun dress. the next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. he lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed just below his neck, into the spine. there were grownups, too, i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro's german-speaking colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead." p. 358.

"the armenians just shot and shot. and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives." " they were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed rasia aslanova, who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through armenian lines. she said her husband, kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. her daughter was still missing. one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off. the survivors said 2000 others, some of whom had fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. by late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial, two were children and three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range. agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. nor were they safe in agdam. on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150,000, destroying several buildings and killing one person. now wait, there is more. it's inhumane to ignore this violence the stories of survivors of karabag massacre: 69 year old hatin nine telling: -''my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. they told me: we won't kill you. but the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu: - ''our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours. while killing children and babies mercilessly they said: you are turks, you must die.'' 28 year old gulsum huseyin: - ''they bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' are these stories lies? have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region? the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists, too. two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article. they[british] reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists. what is more here are the pictures. pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. even the armenian radio couldn't claim these "lies." they are saying "exaggeration." that means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... or gulsum huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. some of the western press', led by some french newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. yesterday we gave samples from le figaro. until yesterday's print no news about the real events in karabag were printed. so were the french tv channels.. the subject they considered related to karabag was ''the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks.'' the age we are living in is termed a human rights age. there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csce(conference on security and cooperation in europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. international reactions must be made with international cooperation. with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? where is the cooperation? where are the reactions? and the intellectuals, journalists, writers, tv stations of certain western countries such as france who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?" where are you? serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

some articles on the topic: rtw 12/23 0859 gulf arabs demand iran withdrawal from islands (eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) by youssef azmeh abu dhabi, dec 23, reuter - gulf arab states, emerging from a summit that restored their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on iran on wednesday to reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic gulf island. they issued a statement after a three-day gulf cooperation council summit saying iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that "rocked gulf stability and security." the leaders avoided the anti-iranian rhetoric of recent statements by egypt, which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between saudi arabia and qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit. egypt said its fears about iranian intentions in the region and tehran's alleged encouragement of moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind president hosni mubarak's mediation. the gcc statement stressed that developing relations between the gulf arab states and iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." it denounced iran's measures on the island of abu musa, which it shares with the united arab emirates, and the continued occupation of the greater and lesser tumbs islands. iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah. it has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the uae government. but diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island, which the uae sess as as virtual annexation. the tumbs were occupied by the former shah of iran in 1971 and the uae has since the abu musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. the gcc leaders called on the u.n. to maintain sanctions against iraq for not fully implementing security council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of kuwait. they endorsed once again the "damascus declaration," a pact signed with egypt and syria after their troops took part in the u.s. led alliance that drove iraqi troops out of kuwait. but delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in kuwait last year which would have helped egypt's and syria's economic development programme. they said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the $10 billion agreed last year. the fact that the leaders of all gcc states -- saudi arabia, bahrain, kuwait, oman and qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help. most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. the leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. one put forward by a summit committee headed by oman's sultan qaboos to create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression, such as iraq's invasion of kuwait. another was a saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man "peninsula shield" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a saudi general. little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due to be held in saudi arabia next december. reuter ya dya djg rtw 12/23 0835 gulf leaders end summit abu dhabi, dec 23, reuter - gulf arab states ended a three-day annual summit on wednesday with an appeal to iran to end its occupation of three strategic gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the gulf. a joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two gulf cooperation council members, also called for continued u.n. sanctions against iraq. it said baghdad had failed to implement key security council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from kuwait early last year. the summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a gulf common market, but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in saudi arabia in december 1993. the statement stressed that developing relations between the gulf arab states and iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." it denounced iran's measures on the island of abu musa, which it shares with the united arab emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller islands, the greater and lesser tumbs. it expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was "shaking peace and stability in the area." iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah. it has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the uae government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to exercise their authority over the whole island. the uae has seen this as virtual annexation. the tumbs were occupied by the former shah of iran in 1971 and the uae has since the abu musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. reuter ya dya djg rtw 12/26 1441 iran hints it ready to go to war over islands (eds: updates with snsc statement) nicosia, dec 26, reuter - iran told its gulf arab neighbours on saturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its eight-year war with iraq. "our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 iran-iraq war) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of iran," iran's supreme national security council (snsc) said. a meeting of the heads of the six-nation gulf cooperation council voiced full support on wednesday for the united arab emirates (uae) in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands of abu musa, greater tumb and lesser tumb. the move has triggered strong iranian criticism and warnings. besides the uae, the gcc also groups bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar and saudi arabia. iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, who chaired the snsc's meeting on saturday, said during his friday prayer sermon at tehran university: "iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. to reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood." the snsc, quoted by the official iranian news agency irna received in cyprus, also criticised the gcc and described its support of the uae as "irresponsible." "no country will ever be able to covet even an inch of iranian soil," said the snsc. earlier on saturday, the english language tehran times, believed to be close to the foreign ministry, said the uae should be aware that iran's self-restraint had certain limits. it dismissed a uae claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share abu musa with the uae emirate of sharjah still applied. "the idea of abu dhabi officials that tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was "childish," tehran times said. irna said the newspaper was commenting on the gcc statement which urged iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of abu musa island and to pull out of the two other islands. iran says the islands near the entrance to the gulf have historically belonged to it. the dispute flared this year after iran tightened its control over abu musa. reuter af jch rtw 12/28 1011 tehran paper wants iran revive claim to bahrain tehran, dec 28, reuter - radical iranian newspapers, angered by gulf arab claims to three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that tehran revive its claim to bahrain and consider improving ties with iraq. president akbar hashemi rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement last week by leaders of the gulf cooperation council (gcc) backing the united arab emirates (uae) in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands. but the newspapers salam and jomhuri eslami demanded that tehran go further than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of abu musa, greater tumb and lesser tumb. "it is not very clear why the sheikh of bahrain has joined the others," jomhuri eslami said. the gcc groups bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar, saudi arabia and the uae. "if historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of bahrain should go about his own business and the rule of iranian people in bahrain, which belonged to iran until 1970, should be re-established," the paper said. "it is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of iran's sovereignty over bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of bahrain from iran," it added. the late shah of iran relinquished iran's claim to bahrain in 1970, a year before the island became an independent state. iranian leaders since the 1979 islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of tension with conservative arab states across the gulf. salam newspaper said the gcc stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro-western gulf arab rulers had backfired. "no matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the persian gulf, it is the united states and the west which speak the last word," it said. "they (the sheikhs) are nobody," salam said, adding that iran should revise its policy towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy iraq. "disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with iraq...and going along with some saudi-backed trends among the iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of the current situation," the paper said. ties between iran and iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988, improved briefly after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990. but tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war, again called for president saddam hussein's overthrow when he suppressed a shi'ite moslem revolt which swept southern iraq after his 1991 defeat in kuwait. reuter sij mz aet

my recollection of history/documentary books is slitely different. it is my understanding that croats were allies of germany during wwii, while serbs had sided with russia. as a result serbs did take a beating from croats (not bosnian moslems) while germany had the upper hand. even today, russians consider/call serbs as their slovac brothers. this is one of the issues involved in the u.n.'s lack of active intervention against serbs. as for the bosnian moslems, i have not heard of any alliance with germany or russia in recent history. therefore, i am curious if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past history. regards; ramin moshiri

the enemy within ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ by robert i. friedman the village voice, may 11, 1993, vol. xxxviii no. 19 | how the anti-defamation league turned the notion | | of human rights on its head, spying on progress- | | ives and funneling information to law enforcement | roy bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in indiana and read "i led three lives," herbert philbrick's cold war saga of penetrating the communist party for the fbi. philbrick had become an american folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues. it was a time when hollywood produced more than 30 films portraying the informer as the quintessential american patriot. in boston, where philbrick led three lives as an fbi informant, communist party member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a herbert philbrick day and presented the spy with a plaque. for bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the communist menace. "i was fascinated with herbert philbrick," bullock recently told federal investigators, "and so i thought i would try to infiltrate the communist part. in 1957, i went to the sixth world youth and student festival in moscow with the american delegation. i gave them [the fbi a full report on it when i returned, along with some photos i took of some soviet military vehicles." bullock was hooked. for the next two years, he worked as an unpaid informant for the fbi. but he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the anti-defamation league in 1960. now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent american history -- a scandal that may end with the adl's criminal indictment in san francisco. over a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the adl on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes, including the naacp, the rainbow coalition, aclu, the american indian movement, the center for investigative reporting, pacifica, act up, palestinian and arab groups, sandinista solidarity groups, americans for peace now, and anti-apartheid organizations. bullock, who even spied on the recently slain south african nationalist chris hani when he visited the bay area in april 1991, sold many of his adl files on anti-apartheid activists to south african intelligence. meanwhile, between 1985 and 1993, the adl paid him nearly $170,000, using a prominent beverly hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with bullock. last month, police raided adl offices in los angeles and san francisco, as well as bullock's home, confiscating computer files and boxes of documents. according to court records, bullock's files contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information, in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was allegedly stolen from the fbi and police computers. bullock, 58, told the fbi that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the san francisco adl office. "based on the evidence," says inspector ron roth, in a police affidavit, "i believe that roy bullock and adl had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and dmv information." what's more, the san francisco d.a. is investigating bullock for tapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations. documents seized from bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into bay area trash cans: he had the names and phone numbers of employees at the christic institute in san francisco, as well as telephone message slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers), office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders, and inter-office memos. he also had receipts from christic institute's bank accounts at wells fargo and eureka federal savings, as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the dates, and amounts. bullock even knew the balance in the christic institute's checking account. investigations by the fbi and police in san francisco have revealed that the adl has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with israeli government officials. what's more, israel apparently used tips from the adl to detain palestinian americans who travelled there. * * * the adl was established in new york city in 1913 to defend jews, and later other minority groups, from discrimination. it led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the ku klux klan and the american nazi party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement. but there was also a darker side. in the late 1940s, the adl spied on leftists and communists, and shared investigative files with the house committee on un-american activities and the fbi. the adl swung sharply to the right during the reagan administration, becoming a bastion of neoconservatism. to irwin suall, a repentant trotskyite who heads the adl's powerful fact finding department, the real danger to jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists, blacks, and arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in america, as well as the state of israel. in the tradition of his ideological soulmate william casey, suall directed the adl's vast network of informants, who were given code names like "scumbag," "ironside," and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in atlanta -- "flipper." for years, journalists and liberal members of the jewish community knew the adl spied on right-wing hate groups. as long as the targets were anti-semitic organizations like the liberty lobby and lyndon larouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled. but the bullock case reveals that the adl also spied on groups that have a nonviolent, and progressive orientation. this apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the adl's criminal indictment in san francisco, where the investigation began. the human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers. says one source close to the west coast investigation, "it is 99 per cent certain that the adl will be indicted." in the wake of the san francisco investigation, police probes of adl spying are spreading to other parts of the country. "we have received numerous complaints about adl [spying]," says sam adams, a spokesperson for the mayor's office in portland, oregon. on april 16, the harlem-based black united fund of new york, and african american self-help group that bullock allegedly spied on, wrote district attorney robert morgenthau, requesting "an immediate investigation" of the adl. "the adl's actions cause great concern, as it is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil rights....we call upon you to join with the district attorney of san francisco to...bring and end to this latest form of mccarthyism." gerald mckelvey, a spokesperson for morgenthau's office, says, "we have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation." mckelvey adds that morgenthau offered to assist the fbi and the san francisco d.a.'s office on their pending investigation. "they have not, so far, asked for our assistance." the adl acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with law enforcement officials. it also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page press release, "the vast majority of adl's files are composed of news clips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents...." "adl has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency, and the process by which the league gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated." that's what the adl says for public consumption. but morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits. and even as other jewish groups circle the wagons around the adl in a show of solidarity, many do so holding their noses. more than a few jewish officials privately say the adl has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency. "the adl is regarded both inside the jewish community and outside the jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti- semitism and extremist groups," says daniel levitas, the former executive director of the center for democratic renewal, an atlanta- based group that monitors anti-semitism, racism, and hate groups. "one of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the adl's credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity. this scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the jewish community at large because people regard the adl as synonymous with american jewry." * * * bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the adl's cold war worldview. in 1960, he moved to southern california where he became an adl spy for $75.00 a week. bullock almost always used his real name when snooping, although he once called himself elmer fink when corresponding with supporters of alabama governor george wallace. bullock provided the adl's office in los angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to fact finding department head irwin suall, according to court records. under suall's stewardship, fact finding department had become the adl's heart and soul. located at adl national headquarters across from the united nations, the department had assembled a vast library on "hate groups," culling material from publications, speeches, and informants reports. bullock was more than adept at leading a double life. not long after moving to california, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the john birch society who helped him gain access to the group's boston office. there, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the adl. the discovery gave rise to speculation in the adl new york office that they had somehow been penetrated by the birchers. bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups until the early 1970s when adl l.a. head milton sinn was replaced by harvey schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well. a few years later, bullock moved to the castro district in san francisco where he posed as an art dealer. and adl fact finder who had infiltrated the local arab community had just been exposed. when the ensuing scandal died down, bullock was ordered by the adl to penetrate the arabs. the adl was especially concerned about the american-arab anti- discrimination committee, founded by the former south dakota senator james abourezk to combat arab-bashing. in a page out of the cia's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, bullock joined the adc, and then recruited nazis into the group, apparently trying to discredit it, according to published reports. in 1987, the adl sent bullock to attend the national association of arab americans annual congress in washington. according to court documents, bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds. bullock was unable to "follow the money." but he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a naaa delegation that visited congress member nancy pelosi. it's not surprising that the adl penetrated arab organizations. but only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like act up. as far as bullock was concerned, gay groups in san francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called "gay left revolutionaries," prompting him to write about their activities for the adl. bullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after richard hirschhaut, the head of adl's san francisco office, introduced him to thomas gerard in 1986. gerard was then a detective with the san francisco police department's intelligence unit. gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the cia in el salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right-wing death squads. (police searching gerard's briefcase found extensive cia literature about torture and interrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as passports made out to gerard in 10 different names, including thomas clouseau. from a remote jungle island redoubt in the philippines where he fled last november, gerard told the los angeles times that he will blow the lid off the cia's involvement with latin american death squads if he is indicted in the adl spy case.) after their very first encounter in the adl office, gerard and bullock had lunch at mcdonald's, "i liked tom right off," bullock later told a san francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the _voice_. "tom is a very charming, roguish character, with a great deal of integrity. let me say here, i consider tom gerard one of the finest policemen i've ever worked with, absolutely. honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent american." before long, bullock was providing gerard with confidential adl reports on various groups and individuals. in turn, gerard gave bullock classified police intelligence files on local arab americans, skinheads, and others. bullock told the fbi that gerard's material ended up in his adl reports. "i would say 99 percent of the data that i got was name, address, and sometimes physical description. criminal history, very rarely," bullock told investigators. gerard also gave bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of bay area arab american businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to middle east terror groups, as well as surveillance photos of arab americans receiving weapons training overseas. bullock claims that u.s. customs in new york gave gerard the photos. "it was understood that bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information gerard gave him, and that bullock would not release it except to the adl or other law enforcement officers," says an fbi report. there was nothing unusual about bullock's cozy relationship with law enforcement. by the mid-1980s, the adl was swapping files with hundreds of "official friends," the organization's euphemism for u.s. law enforcement and intelligence sources. the adl's relationship with the fbi's counterterrorism office was so close that adl's reports on arab american group's covert ties to middle east terrorists were "must reading." it's no accident that police found a 1986 classified fbi report entitled "popular front for the liberation of palestine (pflp)--new york area" while searching the adl's san francisco office. in 1987, adl spooks investigated seven palestinians and a kenyan studying in california universities on student visas. when the adl discovered they were disseminating pflp literature, it informed the fbi, which in turn took the case to the immigration and naturalization service. after the ins ordered the students deported as subversives, adl regional director david lehrer gloated in the _los angeles times_ about his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's backpedaling now. the "los angeles 8" deportation is still under appeal. * * * while the adl worked quietly with america's top cops, it enjoyed similar ties with israel's spy agencies -- a charge that adl leaders vehemently deny. but as early as july 7, 1961, adl director benjamin epstein wrote to b'nai b'rith executive secretary saul joftes, requesting $25,000 for his investigators. "our information," he boasted to joftes, "in addition to being essential for our own operations, has been of great value and service to both the united states department and the israeli government. all data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the source." in 1987, the adl came under fbi scrutiny in the wake of the pollard spy scandal. while assigned to the navy's anti-terrorist alert center, where he had access to the most closely guarded u.s. secrets, jonathan pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for israel, which, according to federal prosecutors, "could fill a room the size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet." pollard's handler was avi sella, an israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer. pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent adl leader was deeply involved in the israeli spy operation. while there is no proof that anyone connected with the adl was involved with pollard, there is evidence that the adl freely passes information to israeli intelligence. in march 1993, the fbi interrogated david gurvitz, an adl fact finder in los angeles until 1992 when he was fired by suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the simon wiesenthal center. the fbi pointedly asked gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to israel. gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law enforcement contact that michael elias, allegedly a member of a radical plo faction, was scheduled to travel from san francisco international airport en route to haifa. gurvitz phoned the deputy israeli consul general in l.a. with the information. "later the same day," according to a 15-page fbi interview of gurvitz obtained by the _voice_, "gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from the israeli consulate, and who asked gurvitz to repeat the information about elias. gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their conversation was in hebrew so gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an israeli consulate official." among the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in adl files in san francisco was mohammed jarad, a 36-year-old chicago resident who was arrested in israel on january 25, for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to hamas, the large islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories. the chicago adl office runs at least three undercover informants who work with "official friends" in local law enforcement, according to documents released by the san francisco d.a. and sources close to the adl. given these facts, arab american groups surmise that the adl has passed information on jarad to israeli intelligence. one technique used by the adl to monitor the large arab american community in the midwest was to scan the local arab press for funeral notices. according to sources familiar with the practice, adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the palestinian funerals, which sometimes turned into plo rallies. palestinians have been detained at ben-gurion airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in chicago, according to suhail miari, the executive director of the united holy land fund, whose cousin was an arab member of israel's knesset. shortly after jarad was arrested, the israeli government announced that hamas was being run from america with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or fax. israel's charges were played up on the front page of _the new york times_. according to well- placed sources, yehudit barsky, an adl fact finder in new york, worked closely with israeli officials on this campaign of vilification, introducing "friendly" reporters to "official friends" in chicago law enforcement. barsky, who is fluent in arabic, prepared an adl report about how hamas is funded in america. she identified the dallas-based islamic association for palestine in north america as the front organization for hamas in the u.s.a. "its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and individual activists," says the february 1993 adl report, which outlines the organization's development, its activities on u.s. college campuses, and its "metamorphosis" during the gulf war. it also traces hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front- groups from plainfield, indiana, to culver city, california. it is doubtful that barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of "official friends" and adl spies. barsky refused to comment. but she used to talk to greg slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for aipac, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _voice_. "the level of cooperation was very close," slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from israel where he is in graduate school. "if we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the adl." when sha'wan jabarin, a 30-year-old palestinian human rights worker in the occupied territories won a $25,000 reebok human rights award in 1990, slabodkin recalls that barsky faxed aipac the man's entire police file, which she had obtained from the israeli embassy. jabarin had been arrested numerous times in israel, and once confessed to being a member of the plo after having been severely tortured. jabarin, who received a short jail term, became an amnesty international prisoner of conscience. of course, to aipac and the adl, jabarin was a terrorist. slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the u.s. to receive his award, called a representative of al haq, the palestinian human rights group that employed jabarin, to obtain his itinerary. aipac even opened a file on musician jackson browne, who presented jabarin with the reebok award. while the adl may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of arabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists. david gurvitz told the fbi that when he started working as a fact finder for the adl in l.a. in march 1989, adl files already bulged with information about the israel-south african connection and anti- apartheid groups. "gurvitz confirmed that the adl did routinely collect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in the united states," says the fbi report. while gurvitz said there were files in the l.a. adl office dating to the 1930s, he estimated the oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the late 1970s, paralleling begin's rise to power in israel and a deepening of ties between the jewish state and south africa. "in about august, 1992," says the report of the fbi's march 3, 1993, interview with gurvitz, "an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at the south african consulate in los angeles. participating in the demonstration were the los angeles student coalition and the socialist workers party. gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions, and a subsequent demonstration. he wrote a report for the adl on each of the planning sessions and on the demonstration. copies of the reports were disseminated to bullock, among others, in care of the san francisco adl office." in 1986 bullock learned that the consul general of the south african consulate in los angeles would be speaking in las vegas at a meeting organized by willis carto, the head of the anti-semitic liberty lobby. "suspecting that the consul general did not know who willis carto is," says the fbi report, "bullock suggested to gerard that they might want to warn the south africans. gerard agreed and informed the consul general, who canceled his appearance." a few months later, gerard phoned bullock and told him a south african intelligence officer wanted to meet them. during a rendezvous in a hotel near fisherman's wharf, the south african said he was interested in acquiring information on american anti-apartheid activists. the south african, who called himself mr. humphries, also asked for information about groups that were advocating divestments. "gerard, who was present throughout the meeting," says the fbi report, "told humphries that he [gerard] had been employed by the cia....humphries offered to pay bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information. bullock noted that much of the information humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of bullock and the adl." between 1987 and 1991, bullock sold information to south african intelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with gerard. "bullock said it was his impression, though gerard never explicitly told him so, (and bullock never asked) that gerard may have been telling the cia about his and bullock's contacts with the south africans," says the fbi report. "gerard had said he knew the cia 'resident agent' in san francisco....once, after gerard dropped bullock off at bullock's residence following a meeting with louie [who replaced humphries as their handler], gerard said he was going to go to the san francisco cia office." al the while, gerard may have been "tasking" bullock for the cia. "bullock recalled that once, after he had met gerard, bullock went to chicago, illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the adl," says the fbi report. "the target of the investigation was a group called the palestine human rights campaign. bullock learned that a woman [name deleted] was transporting money between the plo or the pflp, and the united states. bullock told this to gerard. gerard later told bullock that gerard's 'guy at the cia' would like to know more. gerard asked bullock if bullock would go back to chicago to gather more information on the palestine human rights campaign. bullock, however, never did go back." gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with mossad, which may have started in 1991 when he went on an adl junket to israel. the adl frequently sponsors trips for american law enforcement officials to israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence agencies. according to an affidavit by san francisco police inspector roth, the "all-expense paid trip [to israel] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the adl to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the united states." gerard may have liked what he saw in israel. a short time after travelling there, he went to addis ababa where he helped with mossad's rescue of ethiopian jews. as gerard's relationship with south africa deepened, he talked more openly about his exploits in the cia. "bullock recalled gerard mentioning that he had been in algeria on cia business, and that gerard discussed the plo and 'safehouses,'" says the fbi report, "to this louie once responded that israeli intelligence had determined that the plo and the african national congress were cooperating. gerard also spoke of having travelled with the cia to afghanistan.... louie also [told gerard and bullock] about his adventures inside south africa as an intelligence officer. both gerard and louie traded 'war stories' and regaled each other and bullock with tales of 'narrow scrapes.'" although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement's investigation of the adl, it was probably the theft of a classified fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi's san francisco office. police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the adl san francisco office. gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to mira boland, the director of the adl's fact finding division in washington, d.c. boland was preparing an op-ed piece for _the washington times_, in which she argued that the nation of islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of l.a. because the group is anti-semitic and violence-prone. (boland, who had arranged the adl police junket to israel attended by gerard, testified in a 1990 criminal trial in roanoke, virginia, that she had worked for the cia for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the defense department before joining the adl. during the trial, boland admitted to sharing information with a cia official at an invitation- only adl conference.) after he was questioned by the fbi last fall, gerard fled to the philippines, which has no extradition treaty with america. gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the adl, but to israel and south africa as well. the _san francisco examiner_ reported that gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage laws. although bullock worked for the adl for 30 years, and irwin suall praised him in a july 1992 memo as "our number one investigator," the adl now argues that he was a rogue agent. in its own defense, the adl also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than journalists. after all, ask adl officials, don't journalists keep files? but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl's method of gathering information couldn't be more striking. journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel. and for the most part, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police agencies. the adl has no such inhibition. because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be corrected. once a proud human rights group, the adl has become the jewish thought police. "the adl says it's a human rights group not just for jews but for everyone," says chip berlet, a highly respected researcher at the massachusetts-based political research associates, which monitors right-wing extremist groups. "that's fine but it can't do that and spy on palestinians. it's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral." "my argument to people is that the adl wears four hats. each of the hats independently is appropriate. it is a broad-based human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination. it is a group that defends jews against defamation. entirely noble. nothing wrong with that hat. it is a group, whose leaders, at least, consistently defend the actions of israel against its critics, which again is entirely appropriate. and it is a group that maintains an information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement. again, there is nothing wrong for a group to do that." "but you can't do all four. it is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of ethics. there's a built-in conflict of interest if you wear all four hats." adl national director abraham foxman apparently sees no such conflict. in a september 1, 1992, letter to the _voice_, foxman complained: "adl has a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional freedoms. any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless" "throughout his pieces [on aipac's spying], friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence of files as a token of mccarthyite inclination. the depiction is misleading in several ways. virtually every journalist, academic, politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant; tracing the logic of friedman's reckless charges, the library of congress is tantamount to the kgb. moreover, disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor mccarthyism." but many believe the adl is increasingly in the defamation business. ask jesse jackson, james abourezk, or the leaders of the new jewish agenda -- all past targets of adl smears. (at the same time, the adl exonerated the fascist world anti-communist league, which assisted ronald reagan's covert war against nicaragua, a policy endorsed by adl leaders.) in the early 1980s, researchers russ bellant and berlet asked to meet fact finding head irwin suall, to discuss their work on anti-semite lyndon larouche. "our view then of irwin suall was that he was this really terrific investigator," says berlet. "so we introduce ourselves, say what we are up to and suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political activities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to. obviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds admirably. we were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very uncomfortable." "and then he leans forward and says, 'the right-wing isn't the problem. the left-wing is the problem. the soviet union is the biggest problem in the world for jews. it's the american left that is the biggest threat to american jews. you're on the wrong track. you're part of the problem.' we were stunned. i was virtually in tears. this is not how i perceived myself. we basically stumbled out of there in a daze." ---------------------------------------------------------------------- letters (response to friedman's article) the village voice, may 18, 1993, vol. xxxviii no. 20 a league of his own robert i. friedman's assault on the anti-defamation league [the anti- defamation league is spying on you." may 11] demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote. it also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his list. the story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and outright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of adl so divorced from reality as to be farcical. friedman is even wrong on such basic, easily determined facts as where adl was founded (chicago, not new york) and the building in which adl's san francisco office is located (not the jewish community federation building pictured). adl has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without "spying" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the law. our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti- jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings. through the years, we have published scores of reports on anti- semitism emanating from both the left and the right. in fact, although friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, adl's primary concern is still the far right. because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes adl can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources. friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists. some have performed great service to the american people -- for example, by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk. the information adl obtains is placed in the public domain, and through the years adl has established a reputation for accurate reporting. friedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight. a few examples: he states that an "adl leader was deeply involved in the [jonathan pollard] israeli spy operation," and that pollard's handler's wife "worked for the new york adl as a lawyer." not true. friedman also states: "adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped palestinian funerals." not true. elsewhere, he asserts that adl was obsessed "with spying on anti-apartheid activists." again, not true. we could go on and on -- and, of course, friedman does not reveal *his* sources. the distortion games friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of objectivity. when it comes to how much adl paid roy bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee (an important distinction friedman also fails to make) -- he includes the zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large number. by contrast, when he observes that adl paid bullock "nearly $170,000" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum. what is accurate about friedman's story is chip berlet's description of adl's four hats. yes, adl looks at broad issues of prejudice and discrimination. yes, adl defends israel against critics. and yes, adl maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate crimes. we see no conflict in these four activities, and we believe most _voice_ readers won't either. abraham foxman national director anti-defamation league manhattan ---------------------------------------------------------------------- robert i. friedman replies: for the adl to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd. journalists don't spy on arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then freely pass their files to south african and israeli intelligence. but according to police the confessions of two paid adl investigators, buttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the adl does. indeed, the adl spies on groups that are neither anti-semitic nor violent. police confiscated adl files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from act up to peace now. respected intellectuals and middle east scholars who disagree with the adl's political views have ended up on adl blacklists, their reputations smeared. "private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies," says an april 17 editorial in the _st. louis post-dispatch_, condemning adl spying. on april 10, police armed with search warrants raided adl offices in san francisco and l.a. after concluding that "adl employees were apparently less than truthful" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search, according to san francisco police inspector ron roth's sworn affidavit. roth also asserts that bullock was a "paid employee for the adl." if so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid to bullock, the adl could face a total of 48 felony counts, according to court papers. the adl may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police computers. as for errors: the adl was founded in chicago, and moved to new york in 1947. but it was an original tenant in the san francisco building shown in the _voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago. i never wrote that an "adl leader was deeply involved in the [pollard] israeli spy operation." i reported that pollard himself made the charge. and in court papers, pollard's own lawyer said that the wife of pollard's handler worked for the adl. if i have a bias, it is on the side of the first and fourth amendments.

(a copy of this agreement can be found in the 'congressional record,' november 1, 1945; see document 1.) on this side of the atlantic, nazi armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. they had often expressed pro-nazi sentiments until america entered the war. in 1941, while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps, the nazi armenians in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-soviet armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds between 1914-1920. an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin, which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged by this, the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler's policy of extermination of the jews. this armenian-nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an "encore" performance staged by the armenians during wwi, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million muslims by colluding with the invading russian army. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

[2] 'hairenik weekly,' friday, april 10, 1936, 'the race is our refuge' by o. zarmooni. in april 1942, hitler was preparing for the invasion of the caucasus. a number of nazi armenian leaders began submitting plans to german officials in spring and summer 1942. one of them was souren begzadian paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the armenian republic in baku. paikhar wrote a letter to hitler, asking for german support to his armenian national socialist movement hossank and suggesting the creation of an armenian ss formation in order "to educate the youth of liberated armenia according to the spirit of the nazi ideas." he wanted to unite the armenians of the already occupied territories of the ussr in his movement and with them conquer historic turkish homeland. paikhar was confined to serving the nazis in goebbels propaganda ministry as a speaker for armenian- and french-language radio broadcastings.[1] the armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another nazi armenian viguen chanth.[2] [1] patrick von zur muhlen (muehlen), p. 106.

"they have signed contracts to fly for us," he said. the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our russian pilot, but fighting for the armenians. we had taken off just before 5pm on saturday from agdam airfield, an heated for the armenian-controlled mountains of karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. the civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. we then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards azerbaijani lines. azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed. back at the airfield in agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. they had been shot. what did our russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in nagorno-karabakh? he gave us cheerful grin, politely declined to answer ques tions, and marched off to his dinner. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

let me remind all of those muslim-haters out there who like to mention the mufti's cooperation with germany as a reason to let muslims be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts: 1)why blame the muslims for what the nazis did and forgive italy, the croats, and many other europeans for being real allies to hitler? 2)why blame muslims for supporting germany the enemy of their enemy at the time (britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible for most atrocities against muslims in the region) and forgive germany itself eventhough it is the one who created nazism? 3)as far as muslims are concerned : there was no difference between nazi germany, and antimuslim colonialist britain/france in 1940. they were all racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. wwii and the wars in algeria, sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. even anti- semitism was not more spread in germany than in france or britain, it just happened to be official policy in germany. and we will forgive you, just set our countries free. so any arguments about wwii behaviour coming from the people who killed millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable. enough said.

(2) bosnian muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be croats nor serbs. in 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former yugoslavia as valid, and (1) was soundly rejected. the reasons are pragmatic: even if bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who converted to islam under turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality. in fact, although bosnian muslims have felt drawn to croatian or serbian national allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity. so, arguments like "yes, but your ancestors were croats or serbs" carry very little weight. regardless of what their ancestors might have been, as long as bosnian muslims feel that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate. what outsiders say is simply not relevant. >the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this bosnian debacle has >kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was >changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended! in the case of former yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when "muslim nationality" appeared as a census category for the first time. this was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing "bosniaks" as an ethnic group (1961) to february 1968 resolution (in b-h) declaring that muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement of this in january 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of "muslim nationality" choice in census forms. for comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories available to muslims in bosnia-herzegovina: serb-muslims: 71,991 croat-muslims: 25,295 muslims, ethnically undeclared: 788,403 this clearly demonstrates that muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality. only a tiny minority felt able to choose serb or croat nationality. census results show that bosnian muslims have consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose "undeclared", in 1953 they chose "yugoslavs", in 1961 both "yugoslavs" and "bosniak ethnic group", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose "muslim nationality". perhaps the term "bosnian muslim nationality" is too confusing for the rest of the world. but, in the present context, we are talking about muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some separate national identity. the reasons are mostly historical and cultural. religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general, because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism. political fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no. group security and survival dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology. in fact, bosnia-herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime. sincerely, -josip

may 13, 1993 _five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan_ moscow (upi) -- five soldiers who served in russia's 7th army stationed in armenia were sentenced to death in the azerbaijani capital baku thursday for allegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 azeri soldiers." a statement released by the news service of azeri president abulfaz elchibey said "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the russian state news agency itar-tass reported. but the russian foreign ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in moscow for punishment. "this would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes," the statement reads. the five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in september 1992 by azeri police in the kelbadzhar district of azerbaijan, between nagorno-karabakh and armenia. the supreme court in baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the russian 7th army in the armenian capital yerevan, after which they were sent across the armenian-azeri border into nagorno-karabakh to carry out diversions against azeri troops. however, the russian foreign ministry statement claimed they had deserted the russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with armenian armed forces in the battle zone round karabakh. nagorno-karabakh is an armenian-populated enclave within azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. both yerevan and baku have always claimed that russian servicemen stationed in these caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the soviet union, are fighting as mercenaries in the karabakh war. the statement from moscow said the russian side repeatedly appealed to the azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the russian authorities. it said that president boris yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his azeri counterpart elchibey. itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency. -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal

"turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. on account of this, the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries."[2] "...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. this flaw is older than islam and christianity. but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy!" (a. de mortraye).[3] "turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. on the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism. if you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians, especially that of the orthodoxes. no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens, even today. in turkey, however, if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection." "in that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. because of this, the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon. in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. while the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns. when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of priests."

university press, new york (1991). pages 202-203: <<in 1865, immediately after enactment of the new organic statute for the jewish community, and just as jewish capital from europe was beginning to have an effect in istanbul, local armenians and greeks started a pogrom against jews immediately across the sea of marmara at haydarpasa, terminus of the anatolia railroad, with three hundred jews massacred and many more beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the sultan sent his personal guard across the bay to protect the jews [39]. in later years, ritual murder attacks against jews, carried out mostly by native greeks, armenians, and, in arab provinces, by maronites and other arab christians, often with the assistance of the local european consuls, took place throughout the empire. there were literally thousands of incidents continuously until world war i, in southeastern europe as far west and north as monastir and kavalla, in istanbul, at gallipoli and the dardanelles, at salonica, and in all the arab provinces as far south as damascus and beirut and in egypt at cairo and alexandria. these invariably resulted from accusations spread among ottoman christians by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by christian financiers and merchants anxious to get their jewish competitors out of the way or to divert onto the jews muslim anger at reports of christian massacres of muslims in southeastern europe or central asia, resulting in individual and mob attacks on jews, and the burning of their shops and homes. individual experiences were horrible. jews constantly went in fear of armenian or greek attacks in the streets of ottoman cities. in egypt and syria, it was usually the greeks who led the way, in many cases with the assistance of local armenians and syrian christians, whose greek, arabic and french-language newspapers often printed all the rumors they could find regarding jews, evidently with the desire of instigating violence. the syrian arab christians in particular spread their long-standing anti-semitic hatreds from syria to egypt, where their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes such as egyptian nationalism and opposition to the british rule, enabled them to spread their anti-jewish message among the muslim masses with little question or opposition. on 20 june 1890, thus, sir evelyn baring (later lord cromer), british high commissioner in egypt, received the following report from david and nissim ades, in cairo: ''sir, i beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which has (sic) appeared in an arabic paper called el mahroussa which contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the jews, especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant. now, sir, are we to have here an anti-semitic party amidst fanaticism, greeks, armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? in an article, he asserted that the jews use christian blood for passover, of course this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40] whenever greek and other orthodox religious authorities or prominent greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated or led them.

[decrease what?!?! but posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist *at* *all*! is rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - yigal]. however, racism has not disappeared. when the knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an mk from hadash [the communist party, one of the "arab" parties - yigal] on the state comptroller's committee. and oh, did that ever stir up a storm -- including in the ranks of labor -- since many knesset members find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house committees. "security secrets" are liable to fall into their hands... this attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism, being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds that there are knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of israel. we are not speaking here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination. the proof: one of the compromises proposed was that mk mahamid [an arab - yigal] should be replaced by tamar gojanski [a jew - yigal] from the same party. it was not the member's party which was considered unfit, but his race... [* here is a documented case in a respected israeli newspaper. *] it is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a public debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following article: a test of self-confidence by gid'on levi, ha'aretz, july 26, 1992 revelations of discrimination against arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them. [do you hear that, -----? please contact this levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about israel. please! - yigal]. except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's window dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious. last week provided two more such examples: the israeli knesset is finding it very difficult to allow arab representation on its more important committees; and israel television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to arabs from the territories. seemingly two entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same. the 13th knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its members are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least on one issue. parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition endures forever: no arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house. there has never been and never will be an arab mk on the external affairs and defense committee or on the finance committee. worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not "to give" arabs, for the first time, a place on the state comptroller's committee. the arguments are old and well-known: in all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an arab should hear them. one must not make light of such arguments, but their significance should also not be exaggerated. every arab mk is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarters in jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which could safely be revealed, for example, to mks supportive of the jewish underground, but not to an arab mk from the likud, labor, or even from hadash. the arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if mk nawaf masalha were to hear, god forbid, a review of the foreign minister in an open meeting of the foreign affairs and defense committee, or even a review of the army chief of staff which, in any case, are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news. and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al-najah? their non-participation [in important committees] and that of their colleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where arab members of the elected house have only semi-positions. they are good enough for addressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the immigration and absorption committee. but they must not, for example, participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities. in any case, they have little part in that. labor's dependence on the support of the arab parties has brought about some improvement: mk hashem mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the state comptroller's committee. earlier, there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to hadash who their representative should be, and thus to prevent the arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies, but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step. but not to worry: even now the jewish mind is contriving devices. the new committee chair, roni milo, has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee. thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not. a solution such as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of the committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the knesset.

it seems that, to keep the peace talks going, israel has to keep making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while palestinian arabs continue to go around hunting jews. if the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success, the arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially since they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return for giving up only intangibles. if they keep trying to change the already agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favorite games, the israelis are not likely to be very confident that the intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth the parchment they're written on. it takes two to negotiate a peace. it's time for the arabs to start doing their share. -- alan h. stein astein@israel.nysernet.org

(i am no student of history and i am just asking questions.) i don't think they would have. after all the u.s. was one of the countries that turned away jewish refugees when there was still time to get them out. (considered and rejected at the cabinet level then..) ... under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries, is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such. as i understand it, international law provides the right of any country to intervene to prevent genocide. i think once the world court has ruled that genocide is being committed... if a human rights czar is appointed at the u.n., we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis. this could be backed by adjudication at the international court of justice and enforcement through a rapid deployment force under the u.n. secretary general's command. i would like to see the u.n. directly impose icj rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the un security council.. much as the president can't veto a u.s. supreme court ruling). the u.s. is now supporting the effort to appoint the hr czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries, china, iran and pakistan (what company is pakistan keeping!). the u.s. is also reconsidering its opposition to the u.n. force initially envisaged in the charter (although under the control of the security council). the un sc is quite a flawed body. rogue governments like the prc have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place u.n. troops in bosnia under chapter 7 instead of 11 (if i have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further sc action. (the prc even continues to threaten using its veto on u.n. action despite the icj ruling. the current set-up requires the sc to enforce icj rulings..). peace, gul agha

in article <c7185t.9xj@unix.amherst.edu> eerginel@unix.amherst.edu (erdem erginel) asked: [ee] no, no flaming here. just a simple question. ...with a simple answer! [ee] as far as i know most of the armenians belong to the gregorian orthodox [ee] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century ottoman empire. it is [ee] also known that some armenian communities were converted into catholicism [ee] and protestantism by the western european missionaries in this period. the vast majority of armenians in eastern anatolia were gregorian or armenian apostolic. there was, however, a higher percentage of non-gregorian armenians in cilicia, closer to the mediterranean, in adana, marash, aintab, etc. [ee] another known fact is that almost half of the armenians living in anatolia [ee] did not speak any armenian, but used turkish in their everyday lives. this is not true. while it was forbidden for armenians to speak armenian in certain areas of cilician armenia, most all armenians spoke armenian. in fact, turks who interacted with armenians also spoke armenian! for sure, most all armenians, especially men, also knew turkish in order to function in larger society. [ee] my question is, given so many separations in the armenian community, what [ee] was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian [ee] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? as i stated, religion [ee] was not uniform (unlike the greeks) and many armenians couldn't even speak [ee] armenian. i would like to know what factors brought the armenians in the [ee] ottoman empire together and led to the formation of an armenian [ee] consciousness. the armenians in turkey were persecuted because they were armenian, regardless of the specific branch of christianity they professed. the resultant armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. even at the later stages of wwi, and after the genocide, many armenians who were converted to islam were also exterminated because they continued as armenian moslems. this practice continued well into the 1920s by ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast islamic fundamentalism. many of these converted armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch moslems. [ee] any information will be appreciated. you answered your own question! the common thread throughout your inquiry was the word armenian!

the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term 'turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'muslims.' the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority. the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people, whom all the three nations (bulgarians, turks, and greeks) consider as part of themselves. do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority. they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece. talk about oppression. in addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' greek parliament passed law no. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. they have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. talk about fascism. the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the turkish minority, as state official. although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece, the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. talk about democracy. the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini. such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the 'so-called' greek constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. the government of greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region. the longstanding use of the adjective 'turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers' association, the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace. such community associations had been active until 1984. but they were first told to remove the word 'turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. this is also the final verdict (november 4, 1987) of the greek high court. helsinki watch, a well-known human rights group, had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece. in august 1990, their findings were published in a report titled 'destroying ethnic identity: turks of greece.' the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities. it says for instance, the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini. such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the lausanne convention. |1| helsinki watch: "problems of turks in western thrace continue" ankara (a.a) in a 15-page report of the "helsinki watch" it is stated that the turkish minority in western thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the greek government be brought to an end. the report on western thrace emphasized that the greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the "turkish minority" in western thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as 'turks'. newspot, may 1992 |2| greece isolates west thrace turks the xanthi independent mp ahmet faikoglu said that the greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the turkish minority with turkey. pointing out that while the greek minority living in istanbul is called "greek" by ethnic definition, only the religion of the minority in western thrace is considered. in an interview with the greek newspaper "ethnos" he said: "i am a greek citizen of turkish origin. the individuals of the minority living in western trace are also turkish." emphasizing the education problem for the turkish minority in western thrace faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in 1951 greece must distribute textbooks printed in turkey in turkish minority schools in western thrace. recalling his activities and those of komotini independent mp dr. sadik ahmet to defend the rights of the turkish minority, faikoglu said. "in fact we helped greece. because we prevented greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before european countries by forcing the greek government to recognize our legal rights." on turco-greek relations, he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that turkey and greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating, adding that in turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with greece. newspot, january 1993 |3| macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece. two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in athens for alleged crimes against the greek state, according to a court summons (no. 5445) obtained by mils. hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev (or anastasios bulis) have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in an athenian magazine. sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly magazine "ena" on march 11, 1992, and said that they as macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the up-coming greek general election. bulev said in the interview: "i am not greek, i am macedonian." sideropoulos said in the article that "greece should recognise macedonia. the allegations regarding territorial aspirations against greece are tales... we are in a panic to secure the border, at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec are falling." the main charge against the two, according to the court summons, was that "they have spread...intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens, and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country (greece)." the greek state does not recognise the existence of a macedonian ethnicity. there are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic macedonians living within greece, largely concentrated in the north. it is a crime against the greek state if anyone declares themselves macedonian. in 1913 greece, serbia-yugoslavia and bulgaria partioned macedonia into three pieces. in 1919 albania took 50 macedonian villages. the part under serbo-yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent republic of macedonia. there are 1.5 million macedonians in the republic; 500,000 in bulgaria; 150,000 in albania; and 300,000 in serbia proper. sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian human rights in greece, and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago. he was even exiled to an obscure greek island in the mediteranean. only pressure from amnesty international forced the greek government to allow him to return to his home town of florina (lerin) in northern greece (aegean macedonia), where the majority of ethnic macedonians live. balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent, especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour, the republic of macedonia. last year the state department of the united states condemned greece for its bad treatment of ethnic macedonians and turks (who largely live in western thrace). but it remains to be seen if the us government will do anything until the presidential elections are over. ================================================================ m. i. l. s. ================================================================ 91, rue du craetveld - kraatveldstraat 91 orce nikolov 28 1120 brussels, belgium skopje, macedonia tel/fax: +32/2/268 18 48 tel/fax:+38 91 201 566 modem: +32/2/262 28 97 n.acc: famibank-citibank belgium 954 8691431 92 serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

'ar' refers to a place, as in ararat, archish, aruyr, archar, arshav, arazen and aror, while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and therefore 'armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'. g. alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary "haik" is the diminutive form of "hai", and that "hai" is the name of our nation. our nation is in no way connected with the word "armen" that foreigners apply to our people.' it would thus appear that 'armenia' is a place-name, that 'armen' is the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way connected with the word 'hai'. haik and haiastan: armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom the armenian people took the name 'hai'. but the mere resemblance between the words 'haik' and 'hai' constitutes no real proof, and, in any case, no such theory appears before the time of moses of khoren. haiasa: the following studies show quite clearly that 'hai' and 'haiasa' were no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the region known as armenia. professor hachadurian: 'haiasa was the general name used in hittite inscriptions for upper armenia.' yensen, in his 'hittites and armenians' tries to prove that 'hai' is identical with the hittite 'hatio', in other words that 'hai' is a hittite word. research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown that 'hai' was derived from 'hatio'. mortman's attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with no success. as for greek, there is no point in even mentioning it. the resemblance between the words 'haiasa' and 'haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'haiasa' as the oldest form of 'haiastan'. let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'hai', 'haikazan' and 'haiastan' entered our older works. according to karakashian: 'the word "haik" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren, nor is it ever found employed in the forms "haika" or "haykazn". agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed haiastan, etc.). if the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from "hai" or "haik" they could also have used the words "haikak" and "haykazn" in a number of places.' according to professor sayce, who deciphered a number of hittite inscriptions: 'in the hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. the words "haddanas", "haddina" were used by the assyrians to refer to the hittites. with the transformation of the "d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "hadinasdani" was in this way transformed to "haiastan"'. professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'hai' and 'haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. he finds, however, that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'haiasa' which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from 1400 b.c. onwards. forrer takes 'haiasa' as referring to upper armenia. in that case it seems likely that 'haiasa' was actually a part of armenia. the suffix -dan is of anatolian origin. the real root is 'hayasa', which refers to the country of the 'hayasas'. e. chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people. the armenians in russia may be characterized as follows: almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark, above average height, an aissores asian group with close ties with certain kurdish tribes and azerbaijan peoples. according to j. deniker: from the philological point of view, the armenian and kurds may be regarded as belonging to the iranian group...the armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. they are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 85-87. as a race they belong to the indo-afghan-assyrian-turkic family. professor rene vernont writes as follows: the armenians are a mixture of semites, turk, kurds and mongols, but some of them display armenian features, e.g., height a little above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. investigations carried out by n. kossovitch on the links between armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the armenians did not form a distinct race. serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

will anybody a typical armenian revisionist. as in the past in x-soviet armenia, and today in azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. a short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. as usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. nagorno-karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-soviet armenia. besides the geographical aspect, nagorno-karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of azerbaijan, which renders the armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. no one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the azeris. one cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur, for the armenians either would have slaughtered the azerbaijanis, or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. where was she? an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union. all humanitarian, constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter, universal declaration of human rights, helsinki agreements, human problems international forums, documents signed by the soviet union - all of them are violated. the ussr's president, government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace. the 140,000 strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan. as a result, a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded. some 200,000 azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr, their historical homeland. together with them 64,000 russians and 22,000 kurds have also been driven out, a part of them now settled in azerbaijan. some 40,000 turkish-meskhetians, lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations. one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists' destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr. we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance, for the honour and dignity of 7 million azerbaijanis are violated, its territory, culture and history are trampled, its people are shot. there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media, armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states. one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan. it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh. hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land, had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr. we are for a united, indivisible, sovereign azerbaijan, we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic - muhammed emin rasulzade. but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new '1,000 year reich' - the 'great armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands. the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales, suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent. but what about the lives of seven million human beings? if these people are muslims, does it mean that they are less valuable? can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other attributes? all people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding. this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion. our previous appeals were unheard. however, we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins. 		the committee for people's help to karabakh (of the) academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr "painful search .." the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan - about 600 men, women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over nagorny karabakh. the figure is drawn from azeri investigators, hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh, the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre, but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians. the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku. later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief-stricken azerbaijan's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead. the state prosecuter, aydin rasulov, the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the "hojali disaster", said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings. a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali. an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified. this figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence. francois zen ruffinen, head of delegation of the international red cross in baku, said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from hojali, most of them civilians. "we did not count the bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy," mr zen ruffinen said. "we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead." mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre. "don't get worked up. it will take several months to get a final figure," the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office. mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january 1990. those nationalists, the popular front, finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali, an azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians. officially, 184 people have so far been certified as dead, being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic's forensic department. "this is just a small percentage of the dead," said rafiq youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. "they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours." of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old. gunshots killed 151 people, shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10. exposure in the highland snows killed the last three. thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears, noses, breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out, according to professor youssifov's report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said. files from mr rasulov's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here, six policemen there, and in handwriting of a mosque attendant, the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov, an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27 february. "there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500 in hojali, 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around nakhchivanik village," mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot. "people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman. the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return." there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces. the independent, london, 12/6/'92 heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers, torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago, writes hugh pope. "i'm still wearing the same clothes, i don't have any others," the 51-year-old carpenter said, beginning his account of the hojali disaster. "i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to be alive." mr sadikov and his wife were short of food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh. "at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before, eight or nine kinds of weapons, artillery, heavy machine-guns, the lot," mr sadikov said. soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town, down a hill, through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side. to escape, the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about 15 miles away. they thought they were going to make it, until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak. "none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by a car on the road, and the armenian outposts started opening fire," mr sadikov said. azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians, but their efforts were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through, including his wife and militiaman son. seven of his immediate relations died, including his 67-year-old elder brother. "i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. "we have never got any of the bodies back." the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. one hero of the evacuation, alif hajief, was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing, mr sadikov said. another hero, elman memmedov, the mayor of hojali, said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy hillside, surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam, there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee. "the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian rocket attack. some people just kept going," mr sadikov said. "i had to get to the hospital for treatment. i was in a bad way. they even found a bullet in my sock." victims of war: an azeri woman mourns her son, killed in the hojali massacre in february (left). nurses struggle in primitive conditions (centre) to save a wounded man in a makeshift operating theatre set up in a train carriage. grief-stricken relatives in the town of agdam (right) weep over the coffin of another of the massacre victims. calculating the final death toll has been complicated because muslims bury their dead within 24 hours. photographs: liu heung / ap frederique lengaigne / reuter the independent, london, 12/6/'92 serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

in september 1990, our medical reserve unit was sent to the ketziot prison camp to take care of arab prisoner who were housed in 5 sections of 1500 prisoners each, with each section subdivided in 5 units housing 300 prisoners. the prisoners would "communicate" with other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by taking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing them with incredible precision to other sections. i should have been a recruiter for the red sox :-) there were at least three prisoners who could have been outstanding pitchers. josh backon@vms.huji.ac.il

i always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it (will durant ?), but i am beginning to believe the opposite is true. here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. in the history of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both done by my people and done to my people. since i was not party to any of those acts, i refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my ancestors committed, nor do i direct hatred toward the descendants of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors. will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? will it rebuild the temple? somehow i doubt that it will. a post in another group, on the bosnian war, asked us all to love each other, that love would conquer hate. sadly, i remember a tv interview with a young woman in sarajevo (sp?) who was as i remember, a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. she was now trying to pick-off serbian snipers. during the communist years she had married a serb, who was now fighting against her people. so it seems that hate will conquer love. is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together? it's a damn small planet, which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball, glowing softly in space. we seem to have been spared that prospect, shall we now bathe it in each other's blood? shalom, salam, and peace reb

from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: rabin and his palestinians kapos rabin's plans for a palestinian police (from the other front, alternative information center, jerusalem, 5 may 1993) "the decision to view the setting up of a local police force for (sic) the palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a sign of the israeli government's serious attitude towards the peace process. "the setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package', but deals with the very heart and substance of the palestinian struggle for national identity. as it turns out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by foreign minister shimon peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories." thus writes amnon barzilai in his editorial (israeli daily hadashot, 23 april), and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks. over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be done by the jewish settlers in the west bank and gaza strip. with a variety of demonstrations, including street theater on 'what will happen when there is a palestinian police force', rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the israeli public and to pressure rabin to go back on his decision. members of the kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the occupied territories, as counter-balance to the future palestinian police force. however, as barzilai points out, the main function of the new police force - as far as the israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over whom they will apparently have no authority, but will control political groups within the palestinian population, whom the government is interested in neutralizing. writes barzilai: "...according to ideas currently taking shape, the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede, not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement. "the willingness of the israeli government to set up a local palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the palestinians..." it's no wonder that the palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new israeli initiative. and it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on faisal husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a variety of directions, to refuse the gift which rabin would like to give them. but at this stage, it looks like the palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans. ---------------------------------------------------- add'l comment by e.d.: numerous palestinians fear that israel might succeed in co-opting some palestinian circles by this idea. they fear that a palestinian police force, controlled in fact by israel, might act even more brutally than the idf. the idea of using a surrogate police force is not new. it is used by israel in lebanon and was used by the nazis to control jewish ghetto-dwellers.
reflections on bosnia lord owen and the serbs in early february '93, lord owen made appearances in new york city on the donahue and charlie rose shows. on a couple of occasions on those shows lord owen gave away his pro-serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by serbs before wwii. it was as if he were saying that since the serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the hitler years, they should be allowed to reconquer them today. i was familiar with this view because my father, a yugoslav jew who escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found sympathy among the serbs during those harrowing years. in recent months when the subject of serbian aggression was mentioned, my father would make the point that 850,000 serbs were killed by nazi and pro-nazi croatian forces known as the ustasha. my father is so pro-serbian that he dismissed reports of serbian atrocities. my father also excoriated new york times columnist anthony lewis, because, my father said, anthony lewis "is always talking about the muslims." update--april 28, 1993 after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the clinton administration dithers its response. in the days leading to the collapse of resistance at sbernica, lord owen changed his tune. previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger u.n. relief workers. when serbian forces began to march on sbernica, the threat to u.n. relief soldiers went unmentioned while lord owen called for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes. the current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the west and a failure of the vance-owen initiative which did nothing to halt the serbs. now that it's too late to save muslim areas that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state, lord owen belatedly calls for strong action. clinton and bosnia in the summer of 1992, george kenney, a senior state department official, the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk, made news when he resigned from the state department because of the bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression. as kenney saw it, bush's inaction was largely due to the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there. apparently the same is true of the clinton administration. clinton gives the impression that he cares more than bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has so far been the same. according to the new york times, (4/16/93) the clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-march report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect "safe havens" for the muslims. at one point, senate majority leader, george mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from congress, that he called for an investigation. instead of helping the desperate bosnians, clinton has signalled again and again that milosevic and the serbs are free to do what they want in bosnia--indeed, clinton and the west have been signalling that the serbs should get on with the job and finish off the bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way. a key signal was when clinton made it clear that he would not send in american military forces on the ground. on this issue, clinton has made me wistful for bush. bush and baker could not have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better well before this time. lives in bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed.. the nation, the left and "the bosnian quandary" typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the "bosnian quandary" in the nation (4/26/93). in the end the editorial votes to do nothing, even while noticing "the ghastly atrocities of the bosnian serbs" and that the "greater and lesser powers...dither and fuss [and] hang back." ("before anything else happens, the clinton administration ought to pay the $530 million the united states owes the" u.n. the editorial concludes.) in its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that "those who are pushing president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnians had better review u.s. foreign policy since world war ii." the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the bosnian serbs are no worse than any number of u.s. clients including the chileans, the south africans, the greek fascists and others. (in a subsequent column for the nation, christopher hitchens correctly called this editorial, "contemptible.") *** william pfaff, a european based journalist who writes for the the new yorker and the los angeles times, is among a group of liberal columnists like anthony lewis, and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong western and american intervention to stop the serbs. pfaff's most recent column (liberal opinion week 4/19/93) is entitled "international cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy." he clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence. "having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent croatia in june 1991, or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious "ethnic cleansing" which followed that, the united nations now contemplates deploying in bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors yugoslavia has since experienced." he goes on to explain that u.n. plans now envisaged call for a "more daunting and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago." aryeh neier on the serbs in his "watching rights" column in the the nation (5/3/93) aryeh neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the "aggressors"--the preferred term for the serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling sarajevo for more than a year. he explains that "there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...above all, few of those aligned with the forces attacking sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt. they are not city people. "it is this, i believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of sarajevo...[i]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made sarajevo the object for devastation. "historically, most of the serbian population in bosnia and herzegovina has been rural, while muslims, who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of ottoman rule, made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....the destruction of sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....the demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan." the light that neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake. the serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist, fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban, cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea. they are attacking the rest of us, just as hitler did. one irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over bosnia, it was for awhile maintained by the serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the bosnian muslims to create a fundamentalist state. neier has shown that it is the serbs who are the great threat to secularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy. it's the serbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic idea. anthony lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for clinton's presidency "depend...on his acting effectively against serbian aggression?...first of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess." (times, 4/26/93) but it's not merely a betrayal of our values. it's because the serbs are attacking us by proxy, just as hitler was. one argument for decisive action by the west that is heard in a different form, is that war in the balkans is destablizing for europe. we hear it as, the bosnians are europe's palestinians; that is to say, just as the palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the middle east, just so will the hundreds of thousands of yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in europe for decades to come. one of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the atlantic ocean divides us, the americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of europe. if europe is destabilized, the u.s. will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems. as in a whirlpool, sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom. and as past history and pfaff have shown, it's much better if we do so decisively, quickly and on our terms. sincerely, ronald bleier

"in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city of van, whose 33,789 armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire...leaving erivan on april 28, 1915, armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days." "knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims. armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies." "...meanwhile, czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans, with the president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response: 'from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious russian army, with their blood to serve the victory of russian arms...let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the bosporus. let, with your will, great majesty, the peoples remaining under the turkish yoke receive freedom. let the armenian people of turkey who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of russia.'[155] armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. preparations were made to strike the ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to st. petersburg confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul."

(for the population statistics, please look to the book of richard hovannessian, "armenia on the road to independence.") i listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one armenian, one american, and one british. they are: "men are like that" by leonard r. hartill; "adventures in the near east" by a. rawlinson; "world alive, a personal story" by robert dunn. also, i personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two armenians and also one american. the official british report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (lord curzon-aharonin interview) is the report of the british high commissioner to caucasia, sir oliver wardrop. "an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. the memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in 1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound."

"the tartars were, for the most part, poor. some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains. even the village tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized." "i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars, and, while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility." p. 20 (second paragraph). "our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village. there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain. throughout the hideous night, i cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. by morning the work was finished." p. 109 (second paragraph). "as things were, the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. when they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days. the outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. the method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts." p. 203 (first paragraph). "a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar. i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar's head with it... the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in russian, 'slodkey! slodkey!'

"on the night of the 24th of december, 1963 my wife feride hasan and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr. nihat ilhan. our neighbours mrs. ayshe of mora, her daughter ishin and mrs. ayshe's sister novber were also with us. we were all sitting having supper. all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river direction started to riddle the house, sounding like heavy rain. thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was dangerous, we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer. altogether we were nine persons. we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet. we waited in fear. mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children murat, kutsi and hakan in her arms. suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open. greeks had come in and were combing, every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets. during these moments i heard voices saying, in greek, "you want taksim eh!" and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. mrs. ilhan and her three children fell into the bath. they were shot. at this moment the greeks, who broke into the bathroom, emptied their guns on us again. i heard one of the major's children moan, then i fainted. when i came to myself 2 or 3 hours later, i saw mrs. ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath. i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded. but what had happened to my wife? then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet, where, in the doorway, i saw her body. she was brutally murdered. in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying "help, help. is there no one to save us?" i became terrified. i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me. so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. an our passed by. in the distance i could still hear shots. my mouth was dry, so i came out from under the bed and drank some water. then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago. there i offered sweets to mrs. ayshe, her daughter and mrs. novber who were all wounded. we waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning. i thought morning would never come. we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital. finally, as we could walk, mrs. novber and i, went out into the street hoping to find help, and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik. there, we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on. when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs. ayshe and her daughter. after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment. there i have had four months treatment but still i cannot use my arm. on my return to cyprus, greeks arrested me at the airport. all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my detention. they then released me." on foot into cyprus's devastated turkish quarter we went tonight into the sealed-off turkish quarter of nicosia in which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five days. we were the first western reporters there, and we saw some terrible sights. in the kumsal quarter at no. 2, irfan bey sokagi, we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass. a child's bicycle lay in a corner. in the bathroom, looking like a group of waxworks, were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head. this, we were told, was the home of a turkish army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. today was five days later, and still they lay there. rene maccoll and daniel mcgeachie, (from the "daily express") "...i saw in a bathroom the bodies of a mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a turkish officer..." max clos, le figaro 25-26 january, 1964 serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

[pts] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [pts] [pts] [pts] the conflict over nagorno-karabakh: an azeri perspective [pts] -------------------------------------------------------- [pts] by alec rasizade [pts] [pts] [ar] western readers have learned of the nagorno (upper) karabakh [ar] controversy through reports from that remote area by western [ar] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [ar] armenian-american community. azeri views on this dispute have [ar] appeared rarely if at all in the western news media. therefore let me [ar] present _washington report_ readers with some basic truths about the [ar] origins of the conflict. during the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject, a small minority of the writers have been armenia or azeri. the following should be interesting. [ar] armenian leaders claim that azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [ar] expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic. actually, [ar] the initiative to banish the azeri minority and convert the armenian [ar] republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988, [ar] when 165,000 azeris were driven out of armenia. following that move, [ar] there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait [ar]in february 1988 and two years later, in baku in january 1990. this not true. other than simply checking the newspapers, i will quote from an independent human rights report. in the _pax cristi netherlands_, 29 september 1991, page 28, we read: "by mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in azerbaijan. the apf [azeri popular front] challenged the communist party for power. ... after ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power. in nakhitchevan, the last armenian villages were deported. in ganja, armenians were attacked and killed. all 40,000 armenian inhabitants fled the city..." between 22 november and 8 december 1988, refugees from ganja arrived in armenia while all 167,000 azeris in armenia were chased away." in this part of the world february 1988 [start of organized anti-armenian pogroms in azerbaijan] come before november and december of 1988! [ar] azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [ar] both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule [ar] in the transcaucasus, according to the roman principle of "divide and [ar] rule." similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [ar] history of the conflict. it is interesting that the azeris killed, burnt, raped the armenians but the perpetrators blame russians, and armenians themselves on other occasions. [ar] each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [ar] zheleznovodsk, moscow, tehran, rome, geneva and alma-ata), an [ar] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed. those interested in [ar] maintaining the azeri-armenian conflict, as well as the georgian [ar] turmoil, are imperialist forces in russia, and probably in iran. incorrect! when were the people of nagorno-karabakh ever involved in an agreement? never. until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno- karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [ar] the armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new azeri [ar] refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and [ar] adjacent rural districts. today 500,000 azeri refugees throng the [ar] city of baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly [ar] elected popular front government, which is opposed by the rigidly [ar] nationalistic national independence party. it's called war. if the azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the armenians of nagorno-karabakh to live in their ways, keep their armenian culture, these armenians would not have had to defend their existence. the azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and play dead. [ar] how can a western-style democracy survive in a small muslim country [ar] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed? in the [ar] absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees, as kurdish [ar] and bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the azeri government [ar] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and [ar] possessions? the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions". [ar] such simple realities must be understood in the west. [ar] misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian [ar] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible, [ar] ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus. true, and you, dr. alec rasizade, should practice what you preach! [ar] i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [ar] meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western [ar] states into the conflict through activation of various security [ar] alliances. these include, on the armenian side, the moscow-led [ar] commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact, signed [ar] may 15, 1992. on the azeri side, should turkey get involved as the [ar] guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct. [ar] 13, 1921, these include the north atlantic treaty forces. western interference! turkish intervention! the moment turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of turkey being part of europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of anatolia! dr. rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe. [ar] upper karabakh generally is described in western press reports as an [ar]"armenian enclave within azerbaijan." the truth is that the armenians [ar] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century. incorrect once again. a brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim. armenians today, refer to the area of nagorno-karabakh as "artsakh", which comes from the urartian term "urtekhe-urtekhini". no azeris yet! ancient greeks referred to artsakh as "orkhistena". no azeris yet! in the first half of the 6th century b.c., artsakh, as part of ervandid armenia of media. no azeris yet! from the end of the 4th century b.c., artsakh was part of the armenian kingdom of ervan. no azeris yet! artsakh was still part of the armenian empire of tigran. orkhistena, or artsakh is refereed to by strabo, as part of armenia. no azeris yet! after armenia was divided between the persian and byzantine empires in 387 a.d. until 428, artsakh was part of armenia. no azeris yet! end of the 5th century, utik and artsakh became principalities of the aranshakhiks. no azeris yet! by the 7th century an artsakh dialect of armenian formed. no azeris yet! emperor konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the prince of khachen "to armenia". khachen was the central principality of artsakh. no azeris yet! in the decree of paul i (1797), the number of armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000. it was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-armenians from central asia, asia minor, and kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of artsakh. caucasian muslims around karabakh! in 1813 karabagh becomes part of russia. officiallt part of russia 1828. some muslims in karabakh! in 1914, the number of armenian churches in nagorno-karabagh was 224, 188 priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 armenian towns and villages. the armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. max: 10% azeris in karabakh -- assuming no kurds! consider the following statement by the azerbaijani revcom on december 1, 1920: "the worker-peasant government of azerbaidzan, having been informed of the proclamation of armenia a soviet socialist republic, sends its greetings to the brother people. from this day the previous boundaries between armenia and azerbaidzan are annulled. nagornyi karabakh, zangezur, and nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the armenian socialis republic. long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of soviet armenia and azerbaidzan! 				chairman of the revcom of azerbaidzan 							n. narimanov 				people's commissar for foreign affairs 							guseinov" [ar] a few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [ar] resettlement from persia to karabakh, after it came under russian [ar] rule. no, incorrect. the 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of russian rule in the caucasus, including karabakh! [ar] at the same time the russian colonial administration also drew [ar] in russian and german settlers, who were welcomed by azeris. how [ar] would americans react if the large numbers of armenians living in [ar] southern california suddenly claimed an armenian homeland, and [ar] demanded separation from california? non-sequitur. [ar] armenian historians insist that before the armenian resettlement [ar] karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal christians. that is correct. armenian historians don't say this! [ar] the people of medieval caucasian albania adopted christianity in the [ar] fourth century. but those ancient residents had no link to and [ar] nothing in common with armenians. considering the caucasian albans were of the armenian apostolic faith, and their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an argument totally invalid! [ar] azeris would have a better claim to [ar] be successors of albania, since azeris have for centuries inhabited, [ar] dominated, and developed the karabakh part of the azeri nation. wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. in addition to such absurdity, azeris claim to be turks, persians, and all the while are azerizing their minorities, such as the lezgians, kurds, tat, talish, and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of azerbaijan. [ar] both armenia and azerbaijan last year signed the final act of the [ar] conference on security and cooperation in europe of 1975, and the [ar] paris charter for new europe of 1990, confirming their mutual [ar] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders. this [ar] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [ar] republic of azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [ar] nations, not just by turkey. such agreements do not give azerbaijan the right to de-populate karabakh of armenians. [ar] this is one key to intervention on behalf either of the u.n., the [ar] csce, the commonwealth, nato or iran. the second key to untying the [ar] caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the [ar] u.n. definition of 1974. fine, so why has azerbaijan refused to allow un troops into the armenian enclave? what is azerbaijan afraid of? perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of armenians, the un, would by definition, support the local population! [ar] when that is accomplished, the international community can and should [ar] apply to the aggressor in the caucasus international sanctions such as [ar] those presently being employed against serbia and montenegro in the [ar] former yugoslavia. such decisive collective international action can [ar] halt further aggression in karabakh, and prevent the armenian-azeri [ar] conflict from growing and spreading. azerbaijan's refusal to allow the armenians of karabakh to determine their own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the karabakh conflict. viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at normandy as an act of allied aggression! [ar] dr. alec rasizade, senior research officer at the academy of sciences [ar] of azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the harriman institute of [ar] columbia university in new york. ha! -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal
here is a press release from the white house. text of president clinton's letter to congress on iranian assets to: national desk contact: white house press office, 202-456-2100 washington, may 14 -- following is a letter president clinton wrote to congress on iranian assets: to the congress of the united states: i hereby report to the congress on developments since the last presidential report on november 10, 1992, concerning the national emergency with respect to iran that was declared in executive order no. 12170 of november 14, 1979, and matters relating to executive order no. 12613 of october 29, 1987. this report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the international emergency economic powers act, 50 u.s.c. 1703(c), and section 505(c) of the international security and development cooperation act of 1985, 22 u.s.c. 2349aa-9(c). this report covers events through march 31, 1993. the last report, dated november 10, 1992, covered events through october 15, 1992. 1. there have been no amendments to the iranian transactions regulations ("itrs"), 31 cfr part 560, or to the iranian assets control regulations ("iacrs"), 31 cfr part 535, since the last report. 2. the office of foreign assets control ("fac") of the department of the treasury continues to process applications for import licenses under the itrs. however, as previously reported, recent amendments to the itrs have resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of applications received relating to the importation of nonfungible iranian-origin goods. during the reporting period, the customs service has continued to effect numerous seizures of iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import prohibitions of the itrs. fac and customs service investi- gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. additional forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review. 3. the iran-united states claims tribunal (the "tribunal"), established at the hague pursuant to the algiers accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before it. since the last report, the tribunal has rendered 12 awards, for a total of 545 awards. of that total, 367 have been awards in favor of american claimants: 222 of these were awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions adjudicated on the merits. the tribunal has issued 36 decisions dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing claims for jurisdictional reasons. of the 59 remaining awards, 3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of iranian claimants. as of march 31, 1993, awards to successful american claimants from the security account held by the nv settlement bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77. as of march 31, 1993, the security account has fallen below the required balance of $500 million 36 times. iran has periodically replenished the account, as required by the algiers accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by the nv settlement bank in which interest on the security account is deposited. iran has also replenished the account with the proceeds from the sale of iranian-origin oil imported into the united states, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by- case basis by fac. iran has not, however, replenished the account since the last oil sale deposit on october 8, 1992. the aggregate amount that has been transferred from the interest account to the security account is $874,472,986.47. as of march 31, 1993, the total amount in the security account was $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the interest account was $8,638,133.15. 4. the tribunal continues to make progress in the arbitration of claims of u.s. nationals for $250,000.00 or more. since the last report, nine large claims have been decided. more than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket. the larger claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable awards to the u.s. claimants. for example, two claimants were awarded more than $130 million each by the tribunal in october 1992. 5. as anticipated by the may 13, 1990, agreement settling the claims of u.s. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the foreign claims settlement commission ("fcsc") has continued its review of 3,112 claims. the fcsc has issued decisions in 1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million. the fcsc expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining claims in early 1994. 6. in coordination with concerned government agencies, the department of state continues to present united states government claims against iran, as well as responses by the united states government to claims brought against it by iran. in november 1992, the united states filed 25 volumes of supporting information in case b/1 (claims 2 & 3), iran's claim against the united states for damages relating to its foreign military sales program. in february of this year, the united states participated in a daylong prehearing conference in several other cases involving military equipment. iran also filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure of u.s. courts to enforce an award against a u.s. corporation violated the algiers accords. 7. as reported in november, jose maria ruda, president of the tribunal, tendered his resignation on october 2, 1992. no successor has yet been named. judge ruda's resignation will take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up his duties. 8. the situation reviewed above continues to involve important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the united states and its nationals. iran's policy behavior presents challenges to the national security and foreign policy of the united states. the iacrs issued pursuant to executive order no. 12170 continue to play an important role in structuring our relationship with iran and in enabling the united states to implement properly the algiers accords. similarly, the itrs issued pursuant to executive order no. 12613 continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter- national terrorism. i shall

"we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities against our people (jews). members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near erzurum, turkey, by armenian neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish and/or muslim. armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors. armenians were in league with hitler in the last war, on his premise to grant themselves government if, in return, the armenians would help exterminate jews. armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-semitic acts in league with the russian communists." signed elihu ben levi, vacaville, california.

'i don't believe you," i said, but followed to a nail-studded door. the man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. i thought i should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. all looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted, as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone, so i'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals." p. 363 (first paragraph).

"the lieutenant dozed off, then i, but in the small hours a voice woke me - dro's. he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. anyone keelhauled so long and furiously i'd never heard. then abruptly dro broke into laughter, quick and simple as child's. both were a cover for his sense of guilt, i thought, or hoped. for somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. from daybreak on, armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... the women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of djul. they hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, looms, even spinning-wheels. 'thank you for a lot, dro,' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must leave.'...we shook hands, the captain said 'a bientot, mon camarade.' and for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains. like lot's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'" p. 354.

"it will be three hours to take," dro told me. we'd close in on three sides. "the men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. "that is for morale," dro put in. "we must keep the moslems in terror." "soldiers or civilians?" i asked. "there is no difference," said dro. "all are armed, in uniform or not." "but the women and children?" "will fly with the others as best they may." p. 360. "the ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock.

'tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. shots wasted, i thought, when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb." p. 361 (fourth paragraph). "corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. the bayonet had gone through her back, i judged, for blood around was scant. between the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun dress. the next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. he lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed just below his neck, into the spine. there were grownups, too, i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro's german-speaking colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead." p. 358. "...more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled north. my hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - christian, red or tartar - coming in from transcaucasus. then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'armenian' vilayets of turkey under the control of erevan... an armenia without armenians! turks under christian rule? his lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. that's bloodshed - just smyrna over again on a bigger scale." serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

providing safety and security for one's own people is the most fundamental responsibility of any political entity. for the palestinian leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the responsibility to protect their people from radical palestinian elements who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. to argue that a palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the palestinian leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of palestinians by palestinians. this is a problem that can only be solved by the palestinian people.

[...] ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and, if need be, ascribed to economic reasons. finally, local riots can be incited. these will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the chetniks, rather than the army. there remains one more means, which serbia employed with great practical effect after 1878, that is, by secretly burning down albanian villages and city quarters. (emphasis above is mine.) these events in serbia itself forced out virtually all muslims during late 19th century. this policy of state terrorism against muslims, aided by chetnik "private initiative," has continued in wwii and today. for example, muhamed hadzijahic in his book "od tradicije do identiteta: geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana" (sarajevo: svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how serbs killed a muslim in foca in wwii even though he claimed to be a serbian patriot, explaining their action as follows: "inasmuch as you were a serb, you sullied the serb name, because you are a turk [i.e. muslim]. and since you helped us, we shall not torture you." so the shot him instead of cutting his throat. in the past year, serbs have repeated the slaughter of muslim residents of foca. destruction of mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the eradication of the muslim presence from territories claimed by serbs. >>i strongly dispute your notion that croats had a similar older agenda, >>in fact, for the past century or two, croats and muslims have seen >>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly >>relations. your suggestion that croat-muslim relationship is >>anything like serb-muslim relationship is completely wrong. >> >>to say that croats and muslims have a lot in common does not imply >>they are not separate peoples. .... > >	how touching. i have nearly cried while i read this. unfortunately, >	mostly untrue. which part do you claim is untrue? explain yourself, or withdraw your claim. >	croats from croatia mostly had no contacts with muslims, since they >	were mostly "dealt with extreme preudice" long time ago. however >	one of the main agendas is turning bosnia into purely catholic state. croatia never had many muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it was not a part of the ottoman empire. the last major battles between austro-hungarian monarchy and the ottoman empire in croatia were at the end of the 17th century. need i remind you that modern croatian nationalism came into being with dr. ante starcevic, who saw bosnian muslims as the best croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations to sarajevo? you are confusing clericalist croatianism with croatian nationalism here. political nationalism has always been stronger. as for your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that croat-muslim alliance in bosnia-herzegovina is now in trouble. arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split. >	i should add few more things. a.j. evans, in his "on foot through >	b&h" describes that catholic clergy in the last century was >	apparently more scared by serbs, then by turks, because serbs were >	growing stronger and, unlike turks, represented great danger for >	idea of catholic bosnia. president tudjman clearly states in >	his book that muslims do not exist as a separate nation from >	croats and serbs, and he many times suggested, even in interviewes to >	foreign papers, that solution is to split bosnia. > >	josip knows this and he is only working on the image of croatia. in international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the end of them. balance of power thinking has brought together croats and bosnian muslims. this is only natural; all other alignments are unstable. i'm working on pointing out this basic fact: croats and muslims have been aware of it for as long as serbia has existed. you are wrong if you think only "image" is at stake here. croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with bosnian muslims, and vice versa. i think tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice at this point. tensions should have been defused better earlier, before any open confrontation developed. although i still think croatia will survive, it will lose a lot; but bosnian muslims may end up even worse off. however, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse. the key point is: do they still have any hope left? if not, then all bets are off. mr. stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this. i'm deeply hurt. this is not about some "image" but about survival of a concept of a partnership which i believe is natural and essential for both croats and muslims. sigh... josip

(acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war, lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov) "the things i have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of erzurum by the turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the armenians. during the russian occupation of erzurum, no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. while the commander of the first army corps, general kaltiyin remained in power, troops including armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. when the security measures were lifted, the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings. following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. one day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. the roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt... it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. finally, the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. the incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. sometime in january and february, a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum, was killed one night at his home. the commander in chief (odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...we learnt the details this incident from the commander-in-chief, odishelidge. they were as follows: the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades... more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan. large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. later, the murdered turks were thrown into the holes. the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks, and cut their heads off one by one. following the erzincan massacre, the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum... the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. during the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. while the travellers were passing through erzurum, the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired. when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds, they attempted to help them. however, the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows: an armenian had shot a kurd. the kurd fell down but did not die. the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd. however, since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the armenian failed in his attempt. having seen this, the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed. their heads had been cut off by axes. he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. lieutenant colonel gryaznov, who passed through the village of ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. every armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters. among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. the women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. the genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. a few educated armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done. to the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. when he told the girls that the armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february 20: the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall. they had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. the great massacre in erzurum began on february 7... the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. the others, the armenians claimed, were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on. among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers, karagodaviev. today, some turks were murdered on the streets. on february 12, some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems. the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk. when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk?' in erzurum, the armenians burned down the turkish market. on february 17, i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. on the same day when antranik entered erzurum, i reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. however no result was achieved. in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. on the night of 26/27 february, the armenians deceived the russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers. later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. however, the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders. i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. no, for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. however, such people were only a minority. furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause. some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. there were certain others, who, when accused by the russians of infamy, would say the following: 'you are russians. you can never understand the armenian cause.' the armenians had a conscience. they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldiers. the incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the armenian ideology. nothing which is already done can be undone." serdar argic 'we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of

i don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some interest to any of them. it's my impression that both islam and christianity pay great respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from judea/galilee. why they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery to me (personally, i prefer woody allen - his stories are much juicier) - but perhaps it's an accident of history. anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different jews. according to the new testament his father's name was joseph, while in qur'an he appears as zachariah. who's right and why the name difference? i'm really curious. david.
ilyess sez: >so how would have *you* defended saudi arabia and rolled >back the iraqi invasion, were you in charge of saudi arabia??? all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq, not to "liberate kuwait", the people who were killed by the invasion are more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the iraqis in their smaller invasion. i lived in the west, and i have seen how your media prepared you (helpless naive americans) for a war against ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no doubt you plan on exploiting "helpless naive americans" for your own purposes. hmm...let's see: iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that led to the invasion, as the cia correctly predicted (and pretended to be surprised not to know). it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. what would i have done: most muslims would choose 300 dead kuwaitis over 200,000 dead iraqis and 1000 dead kuwaitis. the first case would happen if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement. possibly, if 200,000 iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on greenpeace estimates. greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of allied miiltary action, while initially *completely* ignoring iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blowing of over 700 oil wells. what is the real number? there has been a lot of work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about. the real number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation. i've included an article i recently posted below, but this is really old news. independent television news reported a figure around 15,000 only a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. for the allies to have killed 200,000 iraqis, they would have had to kill twice the *total* number of iraqis in kuwait. the favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at mutla'. this was yet another example of the american and european media playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies. the destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla' was portrayed as an all-out slaughter. this is simply not true. the head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. before bombers came back, most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled on foot. furthermore, your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies hadn't invaded is completely ridiculous. you have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) that saddam is a barbarous brute. you have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. you *know* that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait, ali majid, was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the kurds in the late 80's and, more recently, the shi'a. yet, when it comes to his treatment of kuwaitis, he is an angel. in your estimate, he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. what a joke! apn 03/09 0006 iraq war dead copyright, 1993. the associated press. all rights reserved. by nick ludington associated press writer washington (ap) -- after the persian gulf war ended, the world was told that as many as 100,000 iraqi soldiers were killed. at one point, even baghdad put the toll that high, as did the u.s. defense intelligence agency in private. but u.s. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. now, one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may have been as low as 1,500. that conclusion by john heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine foreign policy, represents the lowest estimate yet from u.s. defense sources. the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated u.s. military claims in the months after the war ended. claims for a number of u.s. weapons also were scaled down. despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of iraq's disastrous retreat from kuwait, arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the gulf war. heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired. more that a year ago, air force lt. gen. charles horner, the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war, said he believed the iraqi military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the u.s.-led coalition in january and february 1991. on monday, pentagon spokesman lt. cmdr. joe gradisher reiterated past statements that "there just isn't a number," that is credible. but some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 iraqi troops killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar with the pentagon's reports. allied deaths were put at 146 americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 british, 9 by american fire; 2 frenchmen, 1 italian and 39 among various arab allies. of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the army's reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraq's scud missiles. the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. the success record of the navy's tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the pentagon. the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a may 1991 report by the environmental group greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 iraqi soldiers were killed. it estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 iraqi civilians were also killed. the same month, published reports said the defense intelligence agency estimated 100,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the air and ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. but as more information became available, those figures gradually were revised downward. the house armed services committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 wounded after a review last year. but heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign policy, estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as 1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by u.s. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews. he noted that only about 2,000 of 69,000 iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to third world armies like iraq, he set battlefield deaths at 1,500. "maybe the figures are too low," he wrote. "maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. even then, the evidence suggests a death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000." in an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of operations were casualties. he said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia.

(p. 182-183) abu hakima continued in his conclusions that ``kuwait was not a dependency of basra, the persian occupation of basra (1775-79) did not affect kuwait.'' (p.183) kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab world. this identity was clear to the british and the french who tried to win the support of kuwait's sheikh between 1793-95 when the british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the gulf area. --- independent kuwait this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans. the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the ottomans in 1871 against the wahhabis in eastern arabia (where the oil fields in saudi arabia now). kuwait and its ruler at that time, sheikh abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir, allied themselves with the turks:} abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. he joined the expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of al-qatif. had it not been for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet, al-qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours. in relation to this, a question arises as to why the ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment. the answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition. because the ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area, the sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone. kuwait, which was not a party to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it. [ from the above text, we can see that kuwait was not part of the ottomans or the british colonies. for more details about the mentioned expedition, please check out the source of the above text: the modern history of kuwait, 1750--1965, by ahmed abu-hakima, mcgill university, canada ] --- independent kuwait--2 this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans. the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair, iraq, between the sheikh of kuwait and al-zuhair tribe in zubair. in 1866, trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which was [purchased] by his father, sheikh jabir, in 1836. this property was sequestered by a turkish qa'immaqam [representative] on the basis of a claim by the al-zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e sufiyya. at the same time, sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian territory. it should be recalled that the turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants. abdulla ibn sabah, the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his father's agent in the case, narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive. eventually, the dispute was settled by the wali [governor] of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait. the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the turkish side, and suggest that the governor, namiq pasha, even offered him the title of qa'immaqam, which he declined. nevertheless, the proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair. it seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the british agent at basra, the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule. lorimer suggests that the final order of namiq pasha, upholding the kuwait sheikh's title to sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah, ``with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the wahhabi amir.'' in addition to this legal matter with zubair, kuwait had had other problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah, as explained above. however, kuwait's relations with the ottoman mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them. [ source: the modern history of kuwait, 1750--1965, by ahmed abu-hakima, mcgill university, canada ] --- independent kuwait--3 this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans. when pelly [colonel pelly, the british resident in the gulf] visited kuwait for the first time on march 3, 1863, he was met at jahra by sheikh mubarak, the second son of the ruler, sheikh sabah. just before he reached kuwait town on march 4, he was met by sheikh abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been prepared for pelly and his companions. ``scarcely had we entered it,'' says pelly, ``when sheikh sabah himself came.'' this description of pelly's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol. the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by pelly. ``the government is patriarchal,'' says pelly, ``the sheikh managing the political, and the cazee [qadi] the judicial departments. the sheikh himself would submit to the cazee's decision.'' punishment was rarely inflicted. ``indeed, there seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an army.'' pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the country, retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him: when my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``i shall soon die. i have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, but i have made many and true friends, grapple them. while other states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. hold to my policy, and though you are surrounded by desert, and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' [ source: the modern history of kuwait, 1750--1965, by ahmed abu-hakima, mcgill university, canada ] --- independent kuwait--4 this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans. the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a ``good friend,'' but in october 1839, an event took place at kuwait which could have weakened those good relations. on october 30, lieutenant edmunds, the assistant resident at abu shahr [in iran], arrived in kuwait on a special mission from the resident, captain hennell. his mission was to find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean. the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay. the salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh. after edmunds' return to abu shahr, both he and captain hennell explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh, to have been due not to ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british. therefore, they considered that jabir's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the british. if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds, so also did the egyptians. earlier in the same year, some of the most wanted men in the wahhabi camp, such as 'umar ibn 'ufaisan, the wahhabi general in al-hasa, and wahhabi tribes like al-duwaish, sought refuge in kuwait. protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah. this can, therefore, be looked upon as an indication of self-confidence; an outcome of kuwait's independence from foreign powers. it corroborates the fact that kuwait, if necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors. this defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time. as to kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling wahhabis and egyptians. relations with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms.

rasul guliyev, the recently appointed vice-premier of the republic, received the us ambassador in azerbaijan, richard miles. as "azerbaijan" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction of western investments in azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. in particular, gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture. he also noticed, that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the american oil companies will promote the strengthening of the american-azeri relations. the proposal to summon special session of the supreme soviet is rejected again baku (may 19) turan: yesterday, in the sitting of the milli mejlis, the chairman, isa gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy arif rahimzade to summon a special session of the supreme soviet of azerbaijan. this written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. but the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion. earlier, the leadership of the milli mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the supreme soviet a coup attempt. but the deputy for the parliament, rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing milli mejlis and its chairman from the power. it concerns the serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority. rahimzade said that the deputates for the parliament, ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions. the supreme soviet of azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago, when it attempted to bring ayaz mutalibov back to the power. the functions of s.s. were handed over to milli mejlis, consisting of 50 deputates (25 "democrats" and 25 "partocrates"). at that time "democrats" and "partocrates" came to an agreement that milli mejlis wouldn't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. at the same time, the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the supreme soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the parliament. --0-- the prospects of trade/economic cooperation between azerbaijan and estonia baku (may 19) turan: the prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between azerbaijan and estonia were discussed in the meeting of the foreign minister tofig gasimov with the group of experts of the ministry of economics, minister of foreign affairs and estonian bank administration on may 18. the group of experts is headed by tikht reiman, the chief of the ministry of economics of estonia. the mia of azerbaijan informed turan agency, that in their stay in baku, the delegation will also visit ministry of economics and national bank of the republic.--0-- azerbaijan does not intend to join the cis common economic zone baku (may 19) turan: deputy prime-ministers of the republic, vahid ahmedov and abbas abbasov declared that azerbaijan wouldn't join the cis common economic zone. vahid ahmedov considers that the cis economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. according to abbas abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for the discussion of the leaders of cis states in moscow on may 14, has a number of unfavorable points for azerbaijan. such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of azerbaijan and the chairman of the parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the cis economic zone.--0-- the questions of granting

along with the representatives of the national bank will leave for moscow to hold consultation with russian government on granting credit to azerbaijan. according to the preliminary information, the

peace presented by russia, turkey and the usa to azerbaijan and armenia, the representative of the president of azerbaijan in the talks on nagorno-karabakh, asim gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant. "just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by insistence of the armenian side. we do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on may 6",- said gasimov. the representative of the president of azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by may 26. as it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0-- the announcement of the prosecutor of the republic of azerbaijan baku (may 20) turan: the azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 russian soldiers condemned by the military board of the azerbaijani supreme court, as innocent people is unjustified. accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves, prove that their crimes were committed together with the armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the russian army unit, where they served. the announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the russian army are also unfounded. for there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of russian commandos in yerevan. certain russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the russian army in the undeclared war of armenia against azerbaijan from the russian community. azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0-- azerbaijan's parliament intends to appeal to russian parliament regarding the six accused soldiers baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed, parliament of azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to russian parliament about the six accused soldiers' fortune. in particular, the offer to send the representatives of the commission on military affairs of the armed forces of russian federation to baku for the detailed study of the results of six russian soldiers' case will be directed to russian parliament. according to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation. there will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the russian troops participation in the war against azerbaijan. armenians are preparing more "karabakhs" on the north caucasus baku (may 20) turan: the national-liberation front founded by group of armenians living on the north caucasus appealed to establish armenian autonomies on the territories of rostov, stavropol and krasnodar regions, - reported the newspaper "russky vestnik" on march 9, 1993 published in geneva. the north caucasus is regarded as an integral part of armenia in the documents of this organization. admitting the non-realizability of "reunion" of the north caucasus and "armenia proper" at present, the front is appealing to the un, presidents of russia, armenia and the united states to consider the need to establish armenian autonomies on the caucasus. to attain these goals, the armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the north caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical to those in nagorno karabakh". besides the decision to fund cells of armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of armenian terrorist groups in greece and iran to sent to the north caucasus instructors for training of armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted. thus according to the newspaper "russky vestnik", "new karabakhs" are being planning on the north caucasus. --o-- state assistance for national minority development baku (may 20) turan: the meeting headed by the state secretary of azerbaijan, ali kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in baku. the first results of the realization of the president elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on september 16, 1992 were considered. the state secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state. he confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected. the state counsellor of the president of azerbaijan on the national policy, hidayat orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the "undeclared war" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups. for today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the ministry of justice in the capital of azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture and means of communication. all the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the un general secretary). as it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. on the north of azerbaijan where lezghins live, a national lezghin theater was opened, radiocast is transmitted in lezghin. the work over the creation of the educational literature for talyshs, tats, lezghins and kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the academy of sciences of azerbaijan.--o-- memorandum of cooperation on extracting oil-gas fields of azerbaijan was signed baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed in the state concern "azerineft", the memorandum of understanding with the companies "amoco caspian sea petroleum", "bi-pi exploration operating", "pennzoil caspian", "unocal khazar ltd.", "mcdermott" and turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields "azeri", "chirag" and "gyuneshli" was signed. according to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created. according to the president of "azerineft", sabit bagirov, cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. during the project, the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields. the memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields. --o-- armenia taking advantage of the prosecution of six russian soldiers baku (may 21) turan: after azerbaijani court passed sentence on six russian soldiers fighting on the armenian side in karabakh, armenian propaganda has become actively involved. the armenians living in russia appealed to the president yeltsin with a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of russian soldiers". at the same time, armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from russia". the karabakh armenians have issued a threat recently. if one could believe the yerevan agency "snark", the armenians in karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in azerbaijan. the essence of this ultimatum is that if russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three azeri prisoners in karabakh will be shot dead. it is simple to explain such "touching attitude of armenians" to the six russian soldiers' fate. if by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-azeri but anti-armenian reaction, as the accused russian soldiers were recruited in yerevan by the former defence minister of armenia and then transferred to karabakh. if the soldiers get mercy, armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of "innocent russians". --o-- new provocations of armed forces of armenia baku (may 21) turan: according to the defence ministry of azerbaijan on may 20-21, the firing on the territories of azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of armenia was in progress. the day before, the villages of kolly-gyshlag, shotaraz, nyachaflar of zangelan district of azerbaijan were under fire from kafan district of armenia. two inhabitants were wounded, there were destructions in the villages. on may 20, the firing on the villages of bashkend, mutudere, shynykh, novosaratovka and novoivanovka of kedabek district of azerbaijan from the positions of armenian armed forces was in progress. at the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of azerbaijan, penetrated into the territory of kedabek district of azerbaijan, killed two shepherds at the village of aili-dara and made an attempt to take a flock across the frontier. azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--o-- "unocal" company will build 50 houses for refugees in azerbaijan baku (may 21) turan: as turan agency was informed by the representation of unocal american oil company, the leaders of this company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of 50 houses for refugees. at present, the american side suggested a village project for consideration by appropriate departments of azerbaijan. the project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary accommodations and so on. according to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year. --o-- manat is beginning to fall in value baku (may 21) turan: lately, at the black market of baku, the national currency - manat, fell in price compared with the russian ruble. thus one gives 1100 rubles or 120 manats for one us dollar. taking into account the official exchange-value of the manat with respect to ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value 10 percent. meanwhile the exchange-value of the manat to the ruble is the same at banks, state establishments and in trade. according to the representatives of the business circles and experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen. they need rubles for financial operations in russia. as the remittance of payments from the republics of the former ussr to russia is a great problem now, many businessmen arrange deals in cash. taking into consideration the volume of business with russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much rubles in cash the businessmen need. --o-- the discussion of parliamentary election bill will last till mid july baku (may 22) turan: according to the president's decree, the expert group, including representatives of the parliament and presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the constitution of the republic of azerbaijan. this must be adopted by milli mejlis before the parliamentary elections. together with this, the work on the new constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new parliament of the country, is going on. the newsmen were informed about the work on the press-conference of the supreme soviet of the republic the day before. parliamentary legal experts, safa mirzoyev, simran hasanov and representatives of the department of the president's apparatus fazil mustafaev and shahin aliev took part in the press-conference. the national discussion of the project of the parliamentary election law is going on at present. according to simran hasanov the bill didn't cause any objections. it was noted, that until now, no alternative variant of the election law was put forward. the newsmen were also informed, that parliamentary commissions will examine all coming proposals till june 10. by june 15 all proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in milli mejlis.--0-- isa gambar suggests that azeri-russian parliament commission for clarifying the circumstances of the criminal case be created baku (may 22) turan: the chairman of the milly mejlis of the azerbaijan republic, isa gambar, sent the return letter to the chairman of the russian supreme soviet ruslan khasbulatov in connection with the conviction of the russian servicemen lieutenant v.semion, sergeant k. tukish, m.lisov and a.filipov by the military college of the supreme court of azerbaijan. in his letter, isa gambar suggested that the commission of azerbaijan milly mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the russian supreme soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal case. in his view, "the conclusion of the commission could help in the objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems in the future. but the main thing is, it could help to promote the knowledge about involvement of the russian servicemen in crime". in its turn, in connection with the russian parliament message, milly mejlis adopted a resolution on may 19, according to which the permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of this problem.--0-- will the trilateral initiative be ruined? baku (may 22) turan: as turan agency was informed, russian representative to the talks on karabakh, vladimir kazimirov, doubted in realization of the trilateral initiative. he expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with the representatives of azerbaijan. at the same talk he declared, that in case the peace process deadlocked, russia would pursue yeltsin's initiative itself. such statement from the russian diplomat, who is one of the authors of the trilateral initiative, suggests that the russian leadership is paving the way for complete exclusion of the usa and probably turkey from the peacemaking process. this statement can also mean, that russia and us having achieved understanding on bosnian problem, have agreed on partial us departure from transcaucasia.--0-- fate of 645 million tons of oil will be decided this summer baku (may 22) turan: the president of azerbaijan state oil company, sabit bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of oil fields chirag, azeri and guneshli would be signed this summer. as it is known, western oil companies amoco, bp-statoil, pennzoil- ramco have an interest on development of these three richest caspian fields. according to the plan, socar and bp-statoil are to sign a complete treaty on development of chirag field on june 16. later amoco and pennzoil will sign treaties. specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645 million ton. 310 million of them fall on azeri field, 180 mln.ton on geneshli and 150 mln.ton on chirag. the exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to bring in azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. in addition to the net economic profit, baku calculates upon the political support of the west in the defence of its interests at the international scene. as president elchibey said in his closest encirclement "the may of 1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for azerbaijan and its independence and we have to stand these tests".--0-- the scientist-lawyers of russia appealed to the president of azerbaijan baku (may 22) turan: as the press-service of the president of azerbaijan informs, today, the appeal of the institute of the government and law of the russian academy of sciences to president elchibey was received. the appeal contains the call "to display mercy, humanism and clemency on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the russian armed forces". the authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the participation of the russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people, don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce the mercenary according to the un principals, and they are sorry about the russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime. at the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers' mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the president of azerbaijan to "save those guys". it should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers, taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only russian policy. according to their words, the leaders, that lay down lives of russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made answerable. unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers of azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced russian servicemen.--0-- armenian artillery continues firing on azeri districts baku (may 22) turan: on may 22, two soldiers of national army of azerbaijan were killed during the "grad" shelling of the villages of kolly gyshlag, shaifly, shotaraz, nyachaflar of zangelan district of the republic from the territory of kafan district of armenia. the night before and in the morning of may 22, the villages of tovuz,

up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by villages. according to the ministry of internal affairs, the concentration of man power and military equipment is observed in krasnoselsky district of armenia which borders on azerbaijan as well as on the frontier with fizuli district. --o-- azeri prime-minister is leaving for great britain baku ( may 22 ) turan : the minister of foreign economic relations, rauf garayev, in his interview to turan agency said, that "great britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of azerbaijan after iran". the business cooperation between the two countries develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil extraction equipment, communication and agriculture. according to the minister's words, the forthcoming visit of azerbaijani prime-minister, panah huseynov, to great britain on may 23-24, is very important. it is expected, that the visit will help, to solve the problems of opening in azerbaijan the branch offices of some british banks, insurance firms; to conclude contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on building in azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the entire communication system of azerbaijan. in garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with great britain will have a great political meaning for azerbaijan. according to politicians and reviewers in baku, at present, great britain as an european state is close to azerbaijan. the continuation of the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --o-- \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ t u r a n n e w s a g e n c y baku - azerbaijan phone: (8922) 66-7977 66-7833 fax: (8922) 66-2009 telex: 142168 meta su

i must finally admit the total truth that is central to the core of my being. i am a homosexual. not just a normal, run-of-the-mill homosexual, but a rabid homosexual zionist. i hide behind the facade of pro-israel rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my true motive: the exchange of romantic dialogue with nick steel, and our frequent fudge-packing adventures, which we have endeavored to maintain at a discreet level. of course, the need for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here. the truth is that i could no longer hold this saccharine secret any longer. i love you, nick, and my love for you surpasses that which i hold for eretz yisrael, may she stand forever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself into my kosher rectum always will. =mark=
i caught the tail end of a piece on npr (national public radio) about chomsky. apparently there is a new documentary about him and his concepts on the propagandist news media of the west, or some such. the funny thing is that npr painted chomsky and the documentary in such a positive light, or at least ended the report in a positive way. the documentary is just now showing in a few cities in the us, and will open in more cities in june. sorry, forgot the title. -- =jim eggertj@ll.mit.edu (jim eggert)

well everybody, after reading tons of notes by serdar, i have come to the following conclusion. turkey is perfect, and no turk has ever made a mistake. he has proved to me at least that the land occupied by turkey today, was always lived in peacefully by turks. (including istanbul aka constantinople) they treat their minorities like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked them. somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder their population has exploded to almost 60 million in turkey alone. (note, armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total) i want to go to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made serdar possible, that has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers. (amnesty international must have bad sources, turkey would never torture its citizens, treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who incidentally are still missing), what i am trying to say is i want to be a turk!!!! now back to reality. i have once again been astounded by serdars ability to ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note by the page! anybody at all who has believed anything he has said, please step forward. let him know he hasn't been wasting his time, that somebody out there can be convinced by the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. well i am off now. i will go dream some more about that perfect place, that nirvana, that utopia, that xanadu, that turkey! n_w$$h

lovely arguments. but do we write about historical ownership of any place - palestine, pakistan, cyprus, aegean islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others? does it truly matter whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years ago? more than how you treat the land and each other? who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth? who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise? imho, the american indians have it right. we belong to the earth, it does not belong to us. failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around. my guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk. death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins, disease vectors, lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies, nor any other way. when we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves. that is something of which to be proud. very proud. makes me glad to be human. i'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism. maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce. but it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else? [in history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest. if nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.] then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so i can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off. while i, of course, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if i must shoot muslim infants (or bash jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so. that'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the rightness of my cause. clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you. i would never get in the way of such fun. let's see: 	soc.culture.turkish - why don't you turks go back to lake 		baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the 		greeks, who stole it fair and square from the 		scythians? 	soc.culture.pakistan - why don't you guys redistribute 		yourselves over india, as god meant for you to do? 	soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together, 		fight together, die together. we are brothers, and 		inseparable. 	talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there. oded [planning on being a scythian irredentist, as soon as i finish my present assignment.] p.s.:	i can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore? p.p.s.:	yeh, the native americans had it right. we had to kill them 		off to keep their sedition from spreading.

[ic] in fact, there are some areas where armenians are majority. [ic] suppose, a large group of people of one of such area decides, [ic] that the us "government is not representing their interests, and vote for [ic] seperation" from the usa. the armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the united states lawfully and peacefully. however, if armenians invade the united states and force americans to either flee or become armenians, it will not succeed. similarly, the armenians of karabakh are being forced by azerbaijan to either become azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within the stalin-prepared borders of azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and eventually was invaded in 1991 by azeri omon and soviet forces, resulting in the northern third of this armenian area being depopulated of armenians. the armenians have been fighting back ever since. clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for armenians, of let's say glendale, california, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent glendale. similarly, the azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at claiming sovereignty over the land and people of karabakh, who have lived continuously in karabakh a thousand years before the first central asian invaders ever stepped foot in the caucasus. [ic] should they get it? [ic] and should the un enforce their will? [ic] and is it a simple, beautiful concept, indeed? your analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim and invader. a better analogy would be the direct parallel between armenians of karabakh and native americans. now, if you wish, we can discuss the tenets of might versus right and the policies of settler nations! -- david davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org | "armenia has not learned a lesson in s.d.p.a. center for regional studies | anatolia and has forgotten the p.o. box 382761 | punishment inflicted on it." 4/14/93 cambridge, ma 02238 | -- late turkish president turgut ozal
