	the orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season. four shutouts, low team era, (well, i haven't gotten any baseball news since march 14 but anyways) could they contend, yes. could they win it all? maybe. but for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember earl weaver's first law of baseball (from his book on managing) no one gives a damn in july if you lost a game in march. :) btw, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the o's fifth starter? it's pretty much set that sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald and rhodes are the first four in the rotation. here at johns hopkins university where the mascot is the blue jay :(, their baseball team logo was the toronto club's logo. now it's a anatomically correct blue jay. god, can't they think of an original idea? it's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the o's hats. how many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole? __________________________________________________________________________ |admiral steve c. liu internet address: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu| |"committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms | |and their rehabilitation into society" from red dwarf - "polymorph" | |****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!****| | this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

was bob 98% responsible for the win? certainly not; the defense >is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and bob wasn't >pitching. in fact, bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not >even close to 100%). furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs? say >they all came on solo hr by fred; then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game, >which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead (see lindsey), and fred will >himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so. so fred and bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win in one game. there's clearly a problem here. the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has. first, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game. second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning. that is a player who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases. thus, i'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game. sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one. also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game. also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives. >>greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark. closers are enormously important. the total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>the doubling which greg allows is not enough. > >in another article, i proposed a test of this. we can predict a team's >won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they >score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game. if >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right? no, but really only because you have a smaller sample size. i would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning. and, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out. it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning. look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games. on, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win. the offence has many more outs to do something about. but, i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either. if i am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth. >here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball. what >you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >does this make sense? no, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made. look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball. and, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the team would win. from reading all of the discussion on this statistic, i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. at first look this statistic valadates clutchness. but, it really does not. cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down. i've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. so, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance. there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness. certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example. we may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses. how do we evaluate relief pitchers? say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, k's, bb's, etc.) both had exceptional numbers. john, however only pitched in closer situations, while sam was a mop up man. who was more valuble to their team? probably john. who was the better pitcher? they were probably about the same. brian smith
hell, the orioles' opening day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. but unfortunely the yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 sro spots. ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. it's a extremely likelyhood that the o's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89). 	on another front, the sale of the orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon eli jacobs who is major debt apparently. maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. 	fernando has made the o's as the fifth starter. the o's pitching staff looks pretty good. sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, and fernando. 	baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive al east. __________________________________________________________________________ |admiral steve c. liu internet address: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu| |"committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms | |and their rehabilitation into society" from red dwarf - "polymorph" | |****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!****| | this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ second to last day of the season - gregg (the true wild thing) olson uncorks a wild pitch allowing the blue jays to tie. blue jays win in the 11th and ends the baby birds' miracle season of '89.
there's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid. i thought i'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. i splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is frank thomas, at $900k. i cut some players, like kenny lofton, chris hoiles, keith mitchell, tim wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them. the total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300k a player. if that's too steep, you can dump thomas and bagwell, replacing them with paul sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one of the best teams in the majors. p, juan guzman, 500 p, mussina,	400 p, castillo, 250 p, eldred, 175 p, rhodes,	155 p, militello, 118 rp, rojas,	300 rp, beck,	250 rp, melendez, 235 rp, hernandez,	185 rp, nied,	150 c, rodriguez,	275 c, piazza, 126 1b, thomas,	900 1b, bagwell, 655 2b, knoblauch,	500 2b, barberie,	190 3b, gomez,	312.5 3b, palmer,	250 ss, listach,	350 ss, pena,	170 lf, gonzalez,	525 cf, lankford,	290 rf, r.sanders,	275 of, plantier,	245 -- ted frank | "however teel should have mentioned that though thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu | his advice is legally sound, if you follow it the u of c law school | you will probably wind up in jail." standard disclaimers | -- james donald, in misc.legal

hi all, i've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or two without access to really important information. i saw the 3.5 million shoulder back on the dl--how long is he out for (i.e. how many millions/inning will he get this year?) nothing personal against higuera mind you, just wondering how bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current big producers go over a relative pittance. (please realize the term "relative pittance" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball salaries.) additional questions: i did'nt get to see bones pitch this spring--how is he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation? how is surhoff shaping up defensively at third? are they going to build a new stadium? when? tom

philadelphia at chicago: teams tied for 1st after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series. one friday, one saturday, and a good-old sunday doubleheader. "what could be better," declared ernie banks. perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging? "it's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announced ryne sandberg. "if we can get by brewer, then beat carlton, alexander, or bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win. "lord, i hope we pull it off." the phils scored once in the top of the first; richie ashburn singled, pete rose followed with a hit, sending ashburn around second. kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to ernie banks, who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third. rose went to second on the play. christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving pete rose to third. schmidt was walked - the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them. both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year. chuck klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center. "cool papa" bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring. nellie fox was walked, and bob boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. "teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti, and that is lowering their run total. it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen (who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first), and it's a credit to the phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace. the picthers have slumped at times." so came the analysis from frank chance. the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit, thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after sandberg made out - billy williams singled home a run. in the sixth, ron santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1. dick redding got in trouble in the eighth, as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third. ed reulbach entered to face fox, but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit. allen doubled to right, but luckily for the cubs, williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense. he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third. lance parrish, hitting for boone, was walked, and bruce sutter entered. larry bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but ed delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter. desiring a strikeout, since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinch-running at third, chance brought in lee smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning. the cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the phillies. steve carlton was called upon to battle 3-finger brown saturday. to get another righthander in the lineup, ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third. unfortunately, brown allowed six doubles, and the cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty. madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs. gabby hartnett hit two home runs, and cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, cubs after six innings. the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. sunday's twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off robin roberts. grover alexander of the phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the cubs captured the second one 5-4, with waddell gaining the win. bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth. the cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the expos on monday. ------------------------------------------------------------------- montreal at st. louis(august 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st dennis martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus john tudor friday. the expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done. after winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season. martinez triumphed 5-3 on friday, and williams outdueled dizzy dean 3-2 saturday. however, the cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on sunday. the cards captured monday's game, too, as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers 3-2. "we're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed," remarked lou brock. "i don't see why we can't win this division." the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them. two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. ------------------------------------------------------------------- new york at pittsburgh(august 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th! "when your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this," spoke gil hodges before the series. keith hernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins." the pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place dodgers. error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive all-time teams. rube foster defeated sid fernandez 5-2 friday, and candelaria outshone seaver 3-2 saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense. when nolan ryan and two relivers 6-hit the mets in another 3-2 win sunday, the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark. they had been unable to several times in the past month. bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game. both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two-run blast by ralph kiner for the pirates. the mets' darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco, working his second inning, after mookie wilson pinch-ran for gary carter at second. with one out and a runner on first, lee mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit. the pirates countered with kent tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter. tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second. he slid hard into honus wagner, preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon. tekulve allowed a hit, but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning. tug mcgraw relieved randy myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win. the pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------ san francisco at boswaukta(august 3-5): another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire. in fact, reported manager john mcgraw, "once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while." juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday, beating lew burdette and the braves 4-1. willie mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits. rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest. the braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. willie mays had three homers, willie mccovey, eddie matthews, and don baylor had two, and hank aaron, ernie lombardi, biz mackey, and mel ott had one each. the braves had collected 149 home runs going into sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the national league record. they were still a tad behind the '61 yankees' pace. they had allowed over 120, though. vida blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth. he allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh. joe mcginnity earned the save. in the doubleheader, the braves' hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won, 4-3. the giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. the homer by aaron was a magical #150 by the braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. ------------------------------------------------------------------- san diego at cincinnati(aug. 3-5): randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the padres felt rather good. with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game, the trade looked even better. mcgriff's batting average was even rising. of course, the bench was very poor, and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up. jones pitched a good game friday, and won 6-3. mcgriff launched two home runs. mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday; 5-4 was the final score. tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing. the game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth. paige had departed after 10, and john franco hurled a scoreless inning. tom browning was working his second scoreless inning, when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around. thurm munson doubled both runners home, and the padres gamed a 5-3 win. the three-game sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds. though the reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- brookangeles at houston(august 3-5): another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome. the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite don drysdale. "normally," drysdale remarked, "i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them. i can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't afford to let the astros beat us." he then winked and said: "well, maybe davis will get decked once." the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season. the hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples. still, carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers. for those unaware of the nastness of the astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs. the foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet. "it's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'if i can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs'," remarked roy campanella. the dodgers stole five bases friday, but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, davis, jim wynn, and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager. after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop, drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch. he responded with a two-run double, but wynn - playing first for davis - popped up, and the astros didn't score any more in that inning. they did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the astros wound up winning 6-4. they threatened to do even better the next game, as tommy john would be their opponent. walt alston met privately with the starters at 6 a.m. before the game. "i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop," he explained. "how can we do that," pee wee reese wondered. "they're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run. steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws. we'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time." the plan almost worked. mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the astros got three; two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third. 3-2 astros was the final, with dave smith earning another save. the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday, as nolan ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 dodger win. fernando valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to don sutton, however, as the dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough. "we're mostly a power team," remarked ron cey. "jackie and, when he plays, maury wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then. we're sunk in a place like the astrodome. i guess that's why they're so successful there." indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome. the 'stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season. standings after these weekend series: a.l.east team w l gb new york 68 42 -- cleveland 65 46 3.5 detroit 64 46 4 boston 64 47 4.5 baltimore 59 52 9.5 toronto 43 69 25.5 washington 39 73 28 a.l.west oaksaselphia 63 48 -- minnesota 61 48 1 chicago 59 53 4.5 kansas city 57 54 6.5 california 57 56 8 milwaukee 45 66 17 seattle 32 78 31.5 n.l.east chicago 57 53 -- philadelphia 58 54 -- st. louis 58 54 -- pittsburgh 56 56 2 montreal 53 56 3.5 new york 48 64 10 n.l.west brookangeles 66 46 -- cincinnati 66 47 0.5 san francisco 65 46 0.5 boswaukta 54 56 11 houston 50 61 17.5 san diego 36 75 29.5 -- doug fowler: dxf12@po.cwru.edu : me, age 4 & now: "mommys and daddys & other ever wonder if, after casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it? : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"

let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries. i read once that the babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him. let's assume he made that in 1928 (i'm not sure of the figures, but i know i'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-) today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth. fv = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928) = $80,000 x (1.04)^65 = just over $1,000,000. assuming inflation is average of around 5%. fv = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65 = almost 2,000,000. (i didn't crunch these numbers beforehand). these numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly overpaid. the babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now. perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but i don`t think i'm off by much. chop chop michael mule' -- michael andre mule georgia institute of technology, atlanta georgia, 30332 uucp:	 ...!{decvax,hplabs,ncar,purdue,rutgers}!gatech!prism!gt0523e internet: gt0523e@prism.gatech.edu

the o's just lost to the rangers a few minutes ago i was not too happy about the pitching of rick sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) this puts me in remembering the 1990 o's season. after '89 we didn't do much over winter and we wound up in 5th. now i know that mussina, mcdonald, and rhodes are better pitching prospects than ballard and milacki but are any other oriole fans scared out there? admiral steve c. liu p.s. other scores as of now. cincy over montreal, 2-1 i think florida is leading la 6-3 in the 8th! braves vs. cubs, 1-0 in the 8th. futility of cubs batting haunting them. yanks beat the tribe i believe. ____________________________________________________________________________ |admiral steve c. liu internet address: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu| |commander-in-chief of the security division of the pi club - earth chapter| | president of the earth chapter of the pi club - founded april 1990 | |1993 world champions - baltimore orioles - why not? - series in the yards| | 1992-1993 stanley cup champions - washington capitals | | "committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms | | and their rehabilitation into society, the only problem is that the | | abbreviation is clitoris." from the "polymorph" episode of red dwarf | |*****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!*****| | this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! | |"my god man, drilling holes through his head is not the answer!" dr. mccoy| |"you know, susanna hoffs has a really nice ass." - comment by m. flanagan | | the pi club - creating the largest .signatures for the past nine months | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened. the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf. i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation, which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they'd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". granted, witt "might" be good, but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience. the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff. the orioles should also be there in the end..... 						gord niguma 						(to salvage the season, 						let jj olerud win mvp)

	usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible. 	any thoughts on the new (old) reds uniforms. i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card, and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. 	the mets (how about doc's performance today?!!!!!) have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey. to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo. 	many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (phillies, reds, expos, white sox, padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. 	with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.

i just wanted to let everyone know that i have lost what little respect i have for jim lefebvre after seeing today's cubs game. first of all how could he start maldonado over may. after the way may played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench? not to mention that a right hander (maddux) started. i really blew my top when lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields! how can you do that just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. wilkins is twice the hitter that shields is. then the next batter was jose vizcaino, one of the weakest hitters i have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all day, and lefebre let him hit, while may still sat the bench. i think even arnie harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while vizcaino was batting. face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball. 						a dishard cub fan

is there any doubt that this is true? after a few down years, the a.l. east is back to where it was in the early eighties. with the emergence of the o's and the yanks, it is far and away the best. while the n.l. west has the best team in baseball, and the reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else. the giants, astros, and padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the a.l. east. and the dodgers just plain suck. as for the rockies, who knows? the a.l. east has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to free agency, toronto is still one of the best in baseball. the orioles have the preseason favorite to win the cy young in mike mussina, and you can never forget about ripken. the signings of harold baines and harold reynolds don't hurt to much either, although i always liked bill ripken. while they let a lot go this summer (randy milligan, joe orsulak, bill ripken, bob milacki, sam horn, storm davis, and craig lefferts), they kept the heart of their team intact. my predicted finish: 1. baltimore (could be a biased opinion) 2. ny yankees 3. toronto 4. milwaukee 5. detroit 6. boston 7. cleveland (would have been higher if not for the accident) go o's!!!!!!!! --
briefly, since i'm off to sleep. mle's work pretty well for aa nd aaa players. players who are 22 and younger will tend to have explosions in their numbers, whether mmle's or not, in the next 2 years... players who are 26 and older, at those levels, generally have inflated mle's. they're about as reliable as having major league stats for a player. - bob gaj

(it hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art). i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton. "look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say. well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon. it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half-year in atlanta than greenville. then again, it might not. ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor mle's. but you guys don't know. what's worse, you don't know that you don't. and you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again. you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal. it's not. it's got some error. oh well. bill guilford still thinks "hairy butt is truly ugly" might be right

i thought i'd post my predicted standings since i find those posted by others to be interesting. sorry this is after opening day. i certify that these were completed before the first pitch. :-) al east 1. new york yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division 2. toronto blue jays - stewart and morris? no way. 3. milwaukee brewers - they always seem to do better than i expect 4. baltimore orioles - pitching, but devareaux, anderson, and hoiles will drop 5. cleveland indians - still don't seem to know what they are doing 6. detroit tigers - all key players but fryman are another year past peak 7. boston red sox - any team with clemens and viola might be beter than 7th al west - this division was the toughest for me to pick. whoever of the top 4 gets pitching should win it. 1. minnesota twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2. texas rangers - i don't know why i have them here. jose canseco? 3. chicago white sox - frank thomas but no pitching. 4. oakland a's - larussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5. seattle mariners - i like pinella, but don't see much here 6. kansas city royals - will score no runs 7. california angels - will win no games nl east 1. montreal expos - good all around, plus no wallach! 2. st. louis cardinals - (jeffries + whiten) >> (jose + clark), no galarraga 3. pittsburgh pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4. new york mets - some good players, still not a "team" 5. philadelphia phillies - they don't impress me 6. florida marlins - they know what they're doing 7. chicago cubs - they don't know what they're doing nl west - the 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1. atlanta braves - awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2. cincinnati reds - would not surprise me if they won it all 3. houston astros - any team that signs uribe won't contend. closer to 4 than 2 4. san diego padres - plantier could be the sheffield of 1993 5. los angeles dodgers - better pitching than the giants 6. san francisco giants - because the rockies just stink 7. colorado rockies - will become the seattle mariners of the nl. nlcs montreal d. atlanta (braves fans, yes i'm probably contradicting what i said in my nl west comment.) alcs new york d. minnesota world series new york d. montreal - hating the yankees will be fashionable again nl mvp: barry bonds, or maybe mcgriff nl cy young: jose rijo al mvp: frank thomas will deserve it (again), but fielder might win it al cy young: roger clemens (at least will deserve it (again)) -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- david kenney kenney@tribe.b17d.ingr.com

well, maddux looked excellent as the braves shutout the cubs 1 - 0. justice drove in the only run with an rbi single in the first. get ready for him to have a monster year. he is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye. if he stays healthy which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should get over 100 rbi and close to 30 hr. in another note, the marlins got off to a good start beating the dodgers. i believe the score was 6 - 3 but i'm not sure. i wish them and the rockies well this year. hell. i think it would be funny to watch the dodgers hit the cellar again this year. dan smith

since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: the braves could be better off if an injury happens), i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame! 1) back at the beginning of spring training, i though lopez would make the squad easily. olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, i believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june. and then berryhill was dinged up. i was looking forward to this, because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position. before last season, he was the braves "defensive catcher" prospect, while brian deak was the braves "offensive catcher" prospect. besides, olson and berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful. but olson recovered quickly, berryhill recovered, and the braves went with the two vets. i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back. 2) there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around. after all, ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear. there are teams out there without one average ml catcher (california and seattle come to mind). certainly, trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (i think olson's at about $800,000, berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what i recall). 3) yes, i think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also. what is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration? only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible? of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known. from a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep lopez down until june/the first time olson/berryhill go on the dl. 4) i am still disappointed that lopez isn't on the team. i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves, and the truth is that i'd rather see our best team on the field, which, imo, includes lopez. of course,today we play the cubs. hopefully, we won't need him. ;) as for the schuerholz/cox conversation, i imagine it went like this: (remember, they've both been gm's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired) cox: ok, we've sent jones down. his fielding could be a little smoother. besides, blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be. schuerholz: well, we'll have to send nieves down too. deion just won't sign that baseball only contract. we can't count on him in october, so we have to keep nixon around for the defense. besides, gorman's not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet. once hatcher's gone and deion signs, we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez. that ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995. cox: yep, that'll be nice. too bad deion won't sign. ok, i'll look for nieves when justice starts having berry-berry...er, back problems again. now, what about klesko? schuerholz: well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for bream. if we keep klesko, we either lose the money or cabrera. i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same gm. first jeffries for jose, and now whiten for clark! if he gets rid of brian jordan, then i'd have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings! cox: ok, keep trying on bream, and i'll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter/klesko platoon. maybe i can get a few extra at-bats for cabrera while we wait. try california... if snow starts slowly, maybe whiteydal will bite on sid. and if that doesn't work, then perhaps sid's knees could be "persuaded" to act up. there's always the 15-day dl! mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! schuerholz: what about caraballo? cox: well, he's not that much better than lemke. maybe if he starts in richmond, he'll start walking more. besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks. schuerholz: now, let's see. that leaves lopez. cox: nooooo! i gotta keep lopez! sure, i didn't think olson would recover this quickly. maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again? schuerholz: nope, lopez has gotta go. you know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration. may as well put it off that one extra year. besides, until olson's shown his stuff a little bit, i can't trade him. besides, berryhill's a left-handed hitter. you know how rare that is? cox: don't you mean a left-handed whiffer? pretty common, if you ask me. i mean, he made pat borders look good in the world series. pat borders!!! schuerholz: hey, you're the one who wouldn't write lopez into the lineup. cox: well, you're the one who went out and got me jeff reardon! besides, i thought lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff. he got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good. come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate? schuerholz: yeah, but which stiff? whichever one we keep will be hurt by may. cox: ok, ok, you made your point. keep them both. surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest. then i can call up lopez, and then we can win 110 games! the pennant! the world series! i'll be up there with john mcgraw! casey stengel! earl weaver! oh, they laughed at me in toronto, but have you ever had to deal with george bell? i'll finally get my just reward! mwa-ha-ha-ha! schuerholz: easy, bobby. have you been taking those "happy pills" left around by chuck tanner? why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow? cox: don't ask me; ask ted. ------------------------------------------------------- eric roush		fierkelab@	bchm.biochem.duke.edu "i am a marxist, of the groucho sort" grafitti, paris, 1968 tanstaafl!

i've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the marlines to finish ahead of the cubs....how? first base: grace vs destrade...could destrade be the second coming of cecil fielder? i doubt it. if destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to cubs second base: sandberg vs barberie...no contest. sandberg will be back may 1. edge to cubs...a big edge. shortstop: vizcaino vs weiss...vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. weiss isn't much better with the stick. even. third base: dave magadan vs buechelle...magadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter. buechelle has more power and is better defensively (i think) edge to florida. catcher: santiago vs wilkins...wilkins is ok, but santiago is better. edge to marlins left field: conine vs maldonado...wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...i know conine has potential. i watched him play at omaha the last couple years. until he actually proves himself, i give maldonado the edge, however, like at 1b, this is position where florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year. center: scott pose vs wilson/may...edge to may, even if wilson. hopefully the cubs will use may and save wilson for pinch running and the like. may isn't ken griffey jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time. right: felix vs sosa...felix jose has occasional power and a bad obp. so does sosa, but sosa also has speed and a good glove. edge to cubs starters: aquino? armstrong? hammond? a lot of fifth starters here. the cubs won't remind anyone of the brave staff, but morgan-castillo-guzman-hibbard is average to ok...better than the marline. edge to cubs middle relief: even. the cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the marlins. carpenter anf klink or decent, but so are assenmacher and mcelroy. closer: a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins. meyers is decent, but no harvey. of course, the cubs may have a few more games to save. look for 30 saves, 5 blown from meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better era) for harvey. edge florida. overall, an edge to chicago. neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course. e -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				go cubs!!!

how many runs will be scored in denver? i don't know. but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in mile high stadium during the last few years of the bears/zephyrs tenure in the american association. here's the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games, all league games and the ratio. i found the same ratios for hr. year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio 1992 10.22 9.10 1.12 1.65 1.58 1.04 1991 9.53 8.87 1.07 1.41 1.26 1.12 1990 10.71 8.72 1.23 1.49 1.24 1.20 1989 9.07 8.34 1.09 1.27 1.11 1.14 1988 9.90 8.37 1.18 1.29 1.08 1.19 1987 12.55 10.70 1.17 2.39 1.92 1.24 1986 9.45 9.33 1.01 1.35 1.38 .98 1985 9.50 8.54 1.11 1.53 1.34 1.14 1984 9.99 9.10 1.10 1.55 1.59 .97 1983 10.60 9.99 1.06 2.03 1.74 1.17 1982 11.29 10.35 1.09 2.24 1.91 1.17 1981 10.29 9.25 1.11 1.43 1.49 .96 1980 10.59 9.43 1.12 1.63 1.46 1.12 1446/13-->1.11 1444/13-->1.11 it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on runs scored (i'll stick with my prediction from last year that it'll be one of the top 3 in the nl this year) and a fairly large effect on homeruns - though apparently not as large as atlanta, wrigley, cincinnati and san diego. still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park. john rickert rickert@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu

most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate, with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times. my opinion, fwiw, to all: mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. i don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what i have, i want him out there. sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, i'll admit). santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as sandy's, but i don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out. that being said, i agree with sending lopez to richmond, at least to start the season. as the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. he has two in which he hit very, very poorly. i want to see that the 92 lopez is real. olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially nl catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. if he had hit well at prior levels, i would say he belongs on the braves; but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in 90 or santiago in 87. one year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy my standards of evidence. javier lopez 1971 1990 bur 428 101 10 1 9 5 0 1 .179 33 .236 .245 .327 1991 dur 389 84 8 1 9 14 7 2 .175 29 .216 .243 .311 1992 grn 445 135 22 2 14 22 7 2 .271 71 .303 .336 .456 1992 atl 16 6 2 0 0 0 0 0 .306 3 .375 .375 .500 maj 16 6 2 0 0 0 0 0 .306 3 .375 .375 .500 min 1262 320 40 4 32 41 14 5 .213 133 .254 .277 .368 tot 1278 326 42 4 32 41 14 5 .214 136 .255 .278 .369 maj 650 244 81 0 0 0 0 0 min 630 160 20 2 16 20 7 2 tot 630 161 21 2 16 20 7 2 on a similar note, i don't understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion. granted, i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush. last year was the first time he ever got 300 ab in one place, so his lines are hard to read. but he has a combined 720 ops in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 ops. he has a total, major and minor, eqa of .249; above major league average, and above average for cf (which was about .240 in the nl last year). he has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. he has two full seasons before reaching his "prime" season of 27. he should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction. deion sanders 1968 1988 fla 21 8 2 0 0 1 1 0 .325 4 .381 .409 .476 1988 int 20 3 1 0 0 1 1 1 .086 0 .150 .190 .200 1989 eas 123 35 1 2 2 9 15 4 .257 19 .285 .333 .374 1989 nyy 47 11 1 0 2 3 1 0 .222 6 .234 .280 .383 1989 int 263 70 11 4 6 18 15 6 .246 37 .266 .313 .407 1990 nyy 133 21 2 2 3 13 8 2 .161 9 .158 .233 .271 1990 int 85 26 7 1 1 14 8 1 .312 18 .306 .404 .447 1991 atl 110 20 2 1 4 12 10 3 .201 12 .182 .262 .327 1991 ric 129 30 5 2 4 7 11 3 .230 17 .233 .272 .395 1992 atl 306 92 10 12 11 22 24 9 .295 60 .301 .348 .520 maj 596 144 15 15 20 50 43 14 .245 87 .242 .300 .418 min 641 172 27 9 13 50 51 15 .252 96 .268 .321 .399 tot 1237 316 42 24 33 100 94 29 .249 182 .255 .311 .408 maj 600 145 15 15 20 50 43 14 min 603 162 25 8 12 47 48 14 tot 601 154 20 12 16 49 46 14 clay d.

did anyone notice the words "not for baseball" printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today? any reason given for this? also, i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview. on 8/22/89, rickey henderson became nolan's 5000th strikeout. on 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against oakland. i believe the last out in the game was made by rickey henderson. and on 5/1/91, nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. it seems that nolan is having a lot of publicity at rickey's expense. imo, rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what i've seen on it lately. they are both great players, but imo, nolan has outclassed rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude. just my thoughts. 						kevin

(it's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers). let's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career. jay bell was given 135 pas in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season. he got 236 pas the next year at age 22, and still underperformed. however, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since. it's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in aaa) during this time, rather than being "rushed"; cleveland might have been better off, i suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him. yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle. but does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations? sherri nichols snichols@adobe.com

having run completely out of time, i've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the a.l. out. qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. al east -- 1993 1. baltimore orioles why the orioles? well, i pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this: -- the blue jays are going the wrong direction. -- can't bring myself to pick the yankees -- milwaukee was a fluke -- indians aren't ready to contend -- red sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better -- detroit's pitching will be the new definition of "replacement level" "but you don't really think the orioles will win, do you." no. as a matter of fact, i can't see any team in the american league winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the yankees, who i hate). but some- body has to win, so i pick the orioles. "you don't really think that brady anderson is going to repeat, do you?" no. i'm basing the orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from cal ripken and glenn davis. "glenn davis? that's insane". yes. so, without further ado: strong points: hoiles, ripken some years, olson, getting rid of billy ripken. weak points: segui may start. valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be the fifth starter. oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup. (does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping ripken? if you can't move ripken out of the #3 spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) would be a good sign: glenn davis wins comeback player of the year. would be a bad sign: in a tight pennant race, team trades for pecota. obprediction: "the streak" continues. harold reynolds leads the team in caught stealing. 2. new york yankees. strong points: abbot, key, perez. could have best pitching in american league. boggs should improve on hayes. weak points: mattingly still considered best hitter. the steinbrenner factor. (the yankees lost to the mets. can wholesale changes be far behind?) never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. wickman & millitello) to win a division. would be a good sign: boggs hits over .300 would be a bad sign: howe gets arrested again. obprediction: mattingly won't top a 700 ops. 3. toronto blue jays strong points: management willing to make big deals. management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. olerud. guzman. alomar. weak points: the jackson for bell trade has shaken my faith in gillick. losing stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign). no one in the outfield can get on base. pitching is thin behind guzman and ward. would be a good sign: jack morris considered cy young contender in august would be a bad sign: club makes no major deals in august. obprediction: morris will post better era and whip totals than last year. and have a losing record. 4. milwaukee brewers strong points: pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. weak points: molitor gone. surhoff at third? why? eldred can't keep it up. would be a good sign: listach and eldred play like last year. would be bad sign: bones plays like last year. obprediction: surhoff won't finish the year at third. 5. cleveland indians strong points: baerga, belle, nagy weak points: pitching staff thin -- losing olin really hurts. starts felix fermin. would be a good sign: bielecki's era is consistent with his atlanta starts. would be a bad sign: ted power -- bullpen ace. obprediction: alomar will be back on the dl by the all-star break. 6. boston red sox strong points: clemens, viola, clemens, detroit, clemens weak points: most incompetent gm in baseball. key free agent signing -- andre dawson. burks is gone -- hatcher in center. would be a good sign: rainouts in between clemens starts. would be a bad sign: clemens on the dl obprediction: russell will make sox fans forget reardon. interpret that how you will :-> 7. detroit tigers strong points: tettleton, phillips, whitaker weak points: if fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year. worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better. this year could be *very* ugly. would be a good sign: cecil fielder deserving the mvp. would be a bad sign: cecil fielder not whining about deserving an mvp. obprediction: cecil *won't* lead the league in rbis. one more division to go.... -- dale j. stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| baseball fanatic "it is considered good to look wise, especially when not overburdened with information" -- j. golden kimball

i was watching the dodgers/marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me. first is that the way the sun was shining in miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball. in comparison wrigley field in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans. the second and most important was the fans. i like these guys/gals! i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball. it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins. the way they were cheering, i thought it was the afc playoffs. of course opening day may have a lot to do with it, but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities. baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement. we'll find out friday how denver bronco fans respond. phillies are 2-0! (i better say it now before my opportunity passes by)
i personally will never forget mike schmidt's home run against the expos in 1980 that decided the nl east. it was also his career high 48th. another home run that i thought was totally incredible was in the 1986 alcs. the ca angles had the boston red sox *1* strike away from the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run. that was the most incredible turn of events i have ever seen in baseball. the sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the ws against the mets. speaking of the mets, isn't it strange how the nlcs that year with the astros almost mirrored the 1980 nlcs with the phillies?? the astros have been painfully close twice i must admit.
this talk about the phillies winning the nl east is scary. very scary! don't get me wrong, im a phillies fan but as late as last year they looked helpless. the funny thing was they did have a lot of injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed their chances. of course, don't forget the dykstra wrist injury in the first or second game?
after reading my local paper today, i found out that the phillies started the 1964 season at 10-2. i am not as old as 1964, but i've heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that season. they were ahead of the cardinals by 15 games that season in mid-august. they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the cardinals took the division. 15!!! games ahead and lost it.... i hope this season is much different.

rogers is the "one-batter lefty" in the bullpen. dusty has also said he trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for kevin. then again, if any of the regular rotation falters, rogers is a possible candidate to start, though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well in an emergency start. steven
joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball. for anyone who didn't see sunday's game, with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform, a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers. later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell is he thinking. earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt, but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench. gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, the guy would be starting on most every team in the league. furthermore, in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home, i can't take this anymore brian, a very distressed cardinal fan. -- brian landmann georgia institute of technology internet:gt7469a@prism.gatech.edu

hi all you ryno fans (and those interested...) todays chicago tribune had this written in it today in regards to ryne sandberg... "ryne sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken left hand and could be back in the lineup by may 1, manager jim lefebvre said friday. doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his gloved hand. '' i'm not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up,'' said lefebvre. '' he's a fast healer, and he doesn't like being on the disabled list. he's been running since he was hurt [march 5] and is in the best shape of his life. may 1 is his target date for getting back in the lineup." hold on to your hats cub fans...more later as information presents itself. jeffery

writes: > in the new book about the mets it talks about how they like to rape little > girls before games. sick jerks!!! > -max 	is this the book by bob klapisch (spelling?), "the worst team money can buy"? if it is, i wouldn't give the book, or anything in it any value whatsoever. klapisch wrote the book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the papers. i'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof that a met player had raped a little girl before a game (let alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not shea. 	for those people who do not know what the press is like in new york, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about any other part of the u.s. keith hernandez said it very well on espn a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a game. i do not read klapisch's news columns regularly, but i do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb up a news story, even if there isn't one there. now as far as the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few days ago, i almost totally blame bonilla. no matter what a member of the press does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist. 	personally, i always thought that a beat writer that always follows a club around should report the news, but not be looking to degrade a team. i don't know whether to blame klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in new york.

(no offense, > gordon). i wouldn't give baserunning that much value. the above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well. if olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third. thus olerud's doubles have more advancement value than alomar's. (of course, alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.) another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams. no team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others. still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams. bill james gives the 1955-1958 senators as an example. they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing. yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created. -- david grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu "we are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

disclaimer -- this is for fun. in my computerized baseball game, i keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." using the 1992 defensive averages posted by sherri nichols (thanks sherri!), i've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. hits stolen have been redefined as "plays kurt stillwell would not have made." ok, i realize that's unfair. kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. but let's put it this way: if we replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? to try and correlate it to reality a little more, i've calculated net hits stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. by the same method i've calculated net double plays, and net extra bases (doubles and triples let by). finally, i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution, or dcon :->. basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. i add this number to ops to get dops (defense + onbase plus slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. so don't take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article. the short version -- definition of terms hs -- hits stolen -- extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs -- net hits stolen -- extra outs compared to average fielder ndp -- net double plays -- extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb -- net extra bases -- extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder dcon -- defensive contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. dops -- dcon + ops -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution. national league name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops alicea, l. 50 21 2 -1 .160 .865 sandberg, r. 108 42 1 1 .134 1.015 thompson, r. 65 20 5 -1 .104 .852 lind, j. 66 8 -2 1 .027 .571 doran, b. 31 -1 4 0 .014 .705 deshields, d. 51 1 -2 1 -.002 .755 harris, l. 25 -4 0 1 -.019 .602 lemke, m. 43 -1 -5 -5 -.038 .573 morandini, m. 37 -9 -6 0 -.069 .580 randolph, w. 13 -16 3 -1 -.088 .582 biggio, c. 34 -26 -4 0 -.091 .656 stillwell, k. 0 -43 -3 -1 -.236 .336 ordered by dops 1.015 sandberg .865 alicea .852 thompson .755 deshields .705 doran .678 *nl average* .656 biggio .602 harris .582 randolph .580 morandini .573 lemke .571 lind .336 stillwell american league --------------- name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops fletcher, s. 59 18 5 1 .116 .811 reed, j. 83 17 3 1 .071 .708 ripken, b. 56 9 -1 -1 .044 .631 baerga, c. 67 0 10 0 .029 .838 blankenship, l. 34 2 2 1 .023 .757 miller, k. 34 -4 1 -1 -.016 .725 alomar, r. 62 4 -9 -2 -.020 .812 knoblauch, c. 50 -13 7 -3 -.024 .718 bordick, m. 37 -4 -2 -1 -.025 .704 kelly, p. 42 -1 -5 -1 -.039 .636 whitaker, l. 40 -8 -1 -2 -.041 .806 reynolds, h. 47 -6 -5 1 -.043 .603 sax, s. 56 -6 -9 -1 -.052 .555 sojo, l. 28 -11 -3 0 -.075 .602 order by dops .838 baerga .812 alomar .811 fletcher .806 whitaker .757 blankenship .725 miller .718 knoblauch .708 reed .704 bordick .691 *al average* .636 kelly .631 ripken .603 reynolds .602 sojo .555 sax more discussion -- dcon formula: ((nhs + ndp)/pa) + ((nhs + ndp + neb)/ab) why such a bizzare formula? basically, it's designed to be added into the ops, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". the extra outs are factored into obp, while the extra bases removed are factored into slg. that's why i used pa and ab as the divisors. for more discussion see the post on hits stolen -- first base 1992 -- dale j. stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| baseball fanatic "it is considered good to look wise, especially when not overburdened with information" -- j. golden kimball

once again, the rockies bullpen fell apart. andy ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run. then game the dreaded relief. three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each i believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity. (final was 4-2 vs expos). despite their problems in the pen, i think the rockies are a team that wont be taken lightly. going into today's game, the had the league's leading hitter and rbi man (galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (young and cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- david rex wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- university of colorado at boulder -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

kevin mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off brett saberhagen plated pitch runner cesar hernandez to give the reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over new york. hernandez ran for pinch-hitter cecil espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on "bob" kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on jeff branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless reds offense. cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter tim pugh blinked in the fifth. he had only given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by vince coleman. coleman was left stranded at third by bobby bonilla after joe orselak popped to short. orselak was pinch-hitting for eddie murray who argued plate umpire kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he should know better than that). murray, and later manager jeff torborg ended up getting tossed. the mets' fifth started with a howard johnson's first-pitch homer. pugh must have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by jeff kent's single, then a ryan thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by mitchell and turned into a rbi triple. catcher hundley's grounder to the drawn-in branson failed to bring thompson in, then the play of the game occured: saberhagen was due up, so reds pitching coach larry rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze. they called it perfectly: thompson was hung out to dry after pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (isn't the national league great??) the reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game. after barry larkin's ground out, mitchell, chris sabo, and randy milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring mitchell. reggie sanders then plated sabo with a long fly to center. a double by oliver might have scored runner dan wilson, but third base coach dave bristol threw up the stop sign too late--wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the reds rally. rob dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily. with two outs and a runner on second bonilla came to the plate and all i could think of was the sunday game in late august last year when bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for cinci's season. bonilla ended up walking, and hojo flied out to left to give the reds their first win in a week, and earned dibble his third save in as many opportunities. the win went to steve foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three. saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though i'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth. i'll take it, though. the reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the royals victory today. the mets are 6-5. the line: new york mets 			ab	r	h		k	bb	lo -----------------------------------------------|---------------------------- coleman lf		4	0	1		0	0	0 fernandez ss		4	0	0		1	0	0	 murray 1b		1	0	0		0	0	0 orselak ph/rf		3	0	1		0	0	0 bonilla rf/1b		3	0	0		2	1	1 johnson 3b		3	1	1		1	0	2 kent 2b			3	1	1		1	0	0 thompson cf		3	0	1		1	0	0	 hundley c		3	0	0		2	0	0 saberhagen p		3	0	0		0	0	0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- totals			30	2	5		8	1	3 hr-johnson (off pugh, leading off fifth, 0-0 pitch) 3b-thompson (off pugh, in fifth, 0 out, 1 rbi, picked-off) 2b-coleman (off pugh, in fourth, 0 out, 0 on, stranded at third) rbi-johnson, thompson cincinnati reds 			ab	r	h		k	bb	lo -----------------------------------------------|---------------------------- kelly cf		4	0	1		0	0	0 branson 2b		3	0	1		0	0	0 larkin ss		3	0	0		0	1	0 mitchell lf		3	1	1		0	0	0 dibble p		0	0	0		0	0	0 sabo 3b			4	1	1		1	0	2 milligan 1b		3	0	3		0	0	0 wilson pr/c		0	0	0		0	0	0 sanders rf		2	0	0		0	0	1 oliver c/1b		3	0	1		1	0	1 pugh p			1	0	0		1	0	0 roberts ph		1	0	0		1	0	0 foster p		0	0	0		0	0	0 espy ph 		1	0	1		0	0	0 hernandez pr/lf	0	1	0		0	0	0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- totals			28	3	9		4	1	5 (*) (*) oliver was stranded in the seventh after his double when wilson was run down. 2b oliver (off saberhagen, 2 out, runner on first, stranded) rbi-milligan, sanders, and mitchell sac-branson sf-sanders and mitchell ibb-larkin gdp-larkin new york	0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 ---- 2-5-0 cincinnati	0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 x ---- 3-9-0 pitching 			ip	r	er	h	k	bb new york saberhagen (l 2-1)	8	3	3	9	4	1 cincinnati pugh			6	2	2	4	4	0 foster (w 1-2)		2	0	0	0	3	0 dibble (s 3)		1	0	0	1	1	1 pb- wilson ejected-murray, torborg umps-kellogg/relliford/runge/demuth attendance 32,435 t- 2:23 coming up: the reds travel to pittsburgh for three then continue on into chicago for three. next game is tuesday at 7:35, expected to pitch are belcher (0-1) vs. tomlin (0-0). rstimets

the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year. with mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats will bang this summer. already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with fielder, tettleton, and deer i think they can win the division. no pitching! bull! gully, moore, wells, and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games. then there is henneman to close it out. watch out boston, toronto, and baltimore - the motor city kittys are back.
	to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career, the answer is johnny mize in his career with the cards and the yanks. he hit three 6 times. i am almost sure about this. in case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by babe ruth and is 72. mize's record may not last for much longer because of juan gonzalez. he has at least three games with three and maybe 4. i know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie. i don't have any record books at college for me to check on though. please let me know, okay, if i am wrong. 	onto the padres. is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news? i don't here anything in los angeles and i can't get mcpaper consistently around here. comment: it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought bell and plantier to the padres. it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann. of course, plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average. bell always could finish with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially jerald clark's numbers. leadoff comment: craig shipley?????? i get on base 29% of the time if i'm lucky at leadoff? hell, of the usual starters, use gwynn. he's got 4 steals already. is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell, though? i haven't seen stillwell's name in any box scores. anyway unless you are going to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn. he at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases. sheffield comment: though the season is early and stats mean nothing. witness phillips batting .500+ currently. but does sheffield have an injury, or anythingelse wrong with him. i just don't hear anything. andy benes: is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91? or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then? has anyone seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, sunday april 18: padres 10, st louis 6. padres sweep the cardinals as gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer. sheffield and tueful also homer in a winning cause. 				thanks for listening-reading 				any comments???? 		kelly keach 		kkeach@pomona.claremont.edu

so far simmons looks like a total idiot. 1) zane smith should learn how to "switchpitch" and return from the dl. i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all. 2) i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week. now otto's latest debacle has restored simmon's reputation. now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the al's highest era among starters. four our sake(not ted's sake), i hope he pitches with a 3.5 era for the rest of the season. yeah, right. 3) tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing. they are still doing decently. but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. merced had a very good oba his rookie year. he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year. 4) walk: well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. but i still think that walk desrved his contract. 5) leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation. i can't understand his and management's fear of losing tom prince through waivers. even if they do, what's the use. he is aright hander like slaught. not a very smart platoon. also, i am blaming leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs(slaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). didn't leyland and simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself? any fool could tell them lavalliere wasn't very fit last year. 6) dennis moeller is scary!!! 7) candeleria: well, he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season. maybe it will be in 3-4 range. but $1 million plus? come on. other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks, patterson has served the pirates very well each year. so far, he seems to have pitched well for the rangers. i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead. 8) the rookie batters: well, young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. i think we should thank doughty for that. 9) rookie pitchers: worse than expected, especially cooke. 10) slaught: how come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? now his value has increased immensely. 11) lonnie smith!! well, eric davis was signed for a comparable amount. let's see. eric can hit better. he can run better. he can field better. now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis. an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith. even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field. 12) management: big big zero. sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay. 13) alex cole fiasco. the pirates infield and cf positions look good. the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders. eric davis, van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield. even without eric davis, thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole, svan slyke, and merced(i think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). simmons did have options for the outfield. ironically, the biggest accomplishment of simmon's tenure was getting alex cole really cheap. too bad. 14) compensatory draft picks for bonds: forget it. the pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. as of now, the issue is still being appealed. now, if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots, nothing else will. on a final note. tim wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. but don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. also, if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> -pravin ratnam

	there are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is either in the jays' farm system or the braves'. his name is bill taylor. he was picked up by the jays, but had to be offered back to the braves before they were able to send him to the syracuse chiefs. 	one report says that the braves took him back and assigned him to richmond. the other says that he is on the chiefs' roster. which one is right?

the phillies salvaged their weekend series against the chicago cubs by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at wrigley field sunday afternoon. it was the phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the phillies have lost a series in the young season. the phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 john kruk 2-run homers and two wes chamberlain homers. however danny jackson, and the phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. mitch williams entered the game with the phillies leading 8-4, however candy maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it. in the 11th, dave hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the phils ahead to stay. however, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the cubs pinch hit randy myers for bob scanlan (they were out of position players) and myers bunted into a double play to end the game. the phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action tuesday, wednesday, and thursday against the padres.

the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching. so far, no takers. personally, i think harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders. sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done. if sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively. wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has reed. the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff. both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years. astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. the dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year. and piazza has also been great on defense. he has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first. wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense. but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs. but i don't think he is as bad as his current average. i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs. dodger

yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's. i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media. 	lee smith? hmmmm... this one's actually pretty close. he's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (wrigley, fenway...). i'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber. 	you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too. simply because minnesota and boston and (for a month) atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves. no way should homerman be in the hof, imho. 	darrell evans? nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like ted simmons, imho), but not a hof'er. > well, in any case, i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody >giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, >marginal. 	lemme ask you this. who the hell playing the game isn't marginal?

good obp, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against tom niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively. 	yount? 3,000 hits, mvp at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff. his '82 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks, as far as ss numbers go. he's a clear hof'er, imho. >isn't done, there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when >certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. gee, can these guys even compare to >the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan? 	well, as far as garvey goes, you're right. garvey is a "mediot" candidate, pushed because of his "winning attitude" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his "great defense" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...). garvey shouldn't be in the hof. 	skyjack? i've said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris' "ability to win" which is nothing more than morris' "ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs". at this point, morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned close to done.). but, in all fairness, morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down tiger teams. while 1984 was (obviously) a great year for detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites. morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of hof "consideration". 	ryan? of course, but be careful. i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about "yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time". after all, nolan never won a cy... damn, he's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years... his w-l record is mediocre... (of course, nolan's a hof'er...) 	puck? probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the hof, most likely). that said, i believe puckett will make the hof, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something really tragic or sudden). he's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best cf's in the game since he joined the league. i've always liked the guy, and i hope he does make it. and, in the end, i think the puck will make it in. but, really, it's too early to sell. 	this debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it or not, i never tire of it. it's an interesting subject. here's an off the top of my head list of potential hof'ers from each team. i probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up. i won't consider anyone who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [note: these are all active players, i'm not counting recent retirees] baltimore: cal ripken (should be a lock by now, even if gehrig's record stands) boston: roger clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), dawson (?) detroit: alan trammell and lou whitaker (possibilities) milwaukee: robin yount (discussed earlier) new york: wade boggs (possibly), mattingly (long shot) toronto: paul molitor and jack morris (possibilities) kansas city: george brett (lock) minnesota: kirby (too early to tell), winfield (lock) oakland: eckersley (lock), mcgwire (too early), rickey (lock), welch (long shot) texas: the mighty nolan [too early to consider canseco or strange :-)] cubs: sandberg (lock) st. louis: ozzie (lock), lee smith (probably) new york: murray (almost a lock), saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain 				 	 past form) [and most certainly, not vince coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)] los angeles: butler, strawberry, and hershiser are all long shots. san diego: tony gwynn (pretty good shot) colorado: dale murphy (a good shot), ryan bowen (just to see if you're awake) 	[before i get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that i left off, and, i didn't include barry bonds, will clark, any atlanta starting pitcher, frank thomas, canseco, mcgriff, etc. because i only considered guys who started playing before 1985)] 	e-mail or post, i almost fear what i may have started here... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- bruce hasch hasch@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu sell the team, eli!!

darryl strawberry's moon shots were fun! he can hit those high and far home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base by the time they landed. we used to say that he should have to file a flight plan at laguardia for some of them. then _bull_durham_ came out and that was changed. :-) on homers he pulled that didn't go high, they were microwave home runs. microwave, as in they got outta there in a hurry! in a game in 1988, he came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket down the right field line that didn't even allow bob murphy the "luxury" of a home run call. the story went he stayed in the clubhouse, the with the mets down by two and two on davey johnson sent for him to pinch hit. he came out of the clubhouse saying "one swing and we go home." he hit the homer, ran the bases, then went straight for the clubhouse to shower and go home. those were the days.... -- scott barman | mets mailing list (feed the following into your shell): scott@asd.com | mail mets-request@asd.com <<! | subscribe let's go mets! | !

boy, hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down braves fans. i mean, all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series. also, being the cubs fan that i am, i really have to hand it to all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have. however, i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid. the way i see it, either i'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation was just plain wrong. you might have us confused with bear fans. ;) anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs would finish up last in their division. (even behind florida?!? sheesh!) these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective division. well, we're ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now. i wonder why. well, the way i see it, the east is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is going to take it, with the exception of florida. every team seems to have good batting and pitching, with philly presently leading the pack. but, i just have to point out, if the cubs do take the east, they'll do it without the benefit of a competent manager. however, and it pains me to say it, the pennant is going to go to the west. just had to get that off my chest. 						doc bem benefit of a compee
was going over some videos last night..... studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting. and enlightening. here's my analysis of jose canseco, circa sep '92, and jose canseco, circa june 1986. 1. he's bulked up too much. period. he needs to lose about 20 pounds, not gain more bulk. 2. his bat speed has absolutely vanished. conservatively, i'd say he's lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a huge amount of speed. 3. that open stance is killing him. note that he acts sort of like brian downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is released. downing could do this without significant head movement - canseco can't. also, note that canseco doesn't always close his stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes, they're fully closed. without a good starting point, it's hard to make adjustments in your swing. what would i do, if i were jose? aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch, so that i'd never have to work again, i'd restructure my entire swing. first, minimize movement before the swing. close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing. hopefully, this will cut down on the time i need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely. second, drop 20 pounds. cut out the weight work. third, relax the wrists. will cost some power, but until i can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives. his strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park. if canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years. if not, he could still hit 600+ hr. -- * gary huckabay * "you think that's loud enough, a$$hole?" * * "movie rights * "well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir, * * available thru * i'd be happy to turn it up for you. i didn't * * ted frank." * know that many people your age liked king's x." *
for the second straight game, california scored a ton of late runs to crush the brewhas. it was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings, but orosco, austin, manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. how's this for numbers? maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarro's era is 0.75. the next lowest on the staff is wegman at 5.14. ouch! it doesn't look much better for the hitters. hamilton is batting .481, while thon is hitting .458 and has seven rbi. the next highest is three. the next best hitter is jaha at .267 and then vaughn, who has the team's only hr, at .238. another ouch. looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. in fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game. still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. the offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. fetters, plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year. lloyd, maldanado, manzanillo, fetters, austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. the starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark. in other news, nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday, while william suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal. today's game with california was cancelled. --salty

tigers' manager sparky anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the tigers completed a two game sweep over the oakland a's at tiger stadium by beating the a's 3-2. here are the highlights: 				r h e oakland		2 9 0 	 detroit 3 7 1 chad krueter scored skeeter barnes from 1st with an rbi double in the bottom of the ninth against none other than dennis eckersley to give the tigers the victory. barnes also had an rbi single to score thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off eckersley (sp?). the a's got their runs on an rbi single by mcgwire in the 1st and a solo homer by reuben sierra in the 6th. deer doubled home kirk gibson in the 7th for the other tiger run. john doherty pitched another strong game for the tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning. he was relieved by bolton and then david haas in the 8th, and haas got the win. bobby witt started for the a's, and was replaced by honeycutt in the 6th, followed by goose gossage in the 8th, and finally eckersly in the 9th. doherty gave up both of the a's runs, while witt gave up the first tiger run and eckerseley gave up the last two. in the post game interview (on wjr radio in detroit), sparky anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career. it was a big moment for him, and i'm sure all of us tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him. and what a way to get number 2,000!. considering the circumstances, i think it might be appropriate to say: woof! go tigers! --randy

attn: those who live inthe philadelphia metro area... back in september i was listening to wip, and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell. the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies. the location for this new park was suggested to be near 30th st station. at the time, the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality. has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream? i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii. but it would be nice to see this a reality. it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles (and if that's the case, the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium, but that's another story). i want to see that day! comments?

i am not sure - but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as winfield's). just think, eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years. jeff reardon - my guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. off the top of my head i would take lee smith first. |> |> well, in any case, i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody |> giving |> |> hall of fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, |> marginal. |> |> honestly, ozzie smith and robin yount don't belong there. they're both |> |> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal. |> well, i strongly disagree here. both of these guys deserve it for sure. i talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively. the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered aaron's home run mark by now. how many of those great plays saved games? how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? while i believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame. as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player. |> let's be a little more selective, huh?

|> steve garvey - i am not sure, probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him. jack morris - once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name. kirby puckett - probably. the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately. nolan ryan - is there really any doubt? i think i heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - i don't know i did not hear any of them just the number). he has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. i really hope he gets all the possible votes. so in summing up i have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go. yes - winfield, yount, brett(not in your mail), o. smith, puckett and ryan maybe - murray and l. smith no - reardon, garvey, morris, evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions. mike |> |> q steve

in a philadelphia inquirer a few days ago, it was reported that there were two (2) plans for a new phillies stadium: the already-mentioned 30th street station proposal, and a location near broad street and race street, i think. i can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be build practically downtown. there is a small lot that could be used, according to the paper. the 30th street plan has run into some trouble, because amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to accomodate the stadium. i don't have an opinion just yet, just letting everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now. neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because nobody wants to pay for it :-) -- keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 						let's go quakers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!!

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't yet been addressed. i believe the rule also does *not* deal with this situation: if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball. however, if the infield fly is *not* caught, at what point can a runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early? when the ball hits the ground? when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground? enlightenment would be appreciated. jay

well, after suffering from an intense fit of minnesota-induced cabin fever, i've decided to road trip to milwaukee and take in a couple of games this weekend. a couple games at county stadium will be great to relieve tension, but i thought "why not go to wrigley for a game too?" i see the cubs are playing the phillies on sat (2:05 start, i believe that's eastern time listed). i figured it would be fun to bounce down to wrigley for the day game and live it up a little. i'm wondering if anyone (esp. cubbie fans) have some advice on: 1) if i'm taking 41 (skokie hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the best way to get to wrigley? i'm planning on getting there an hour or two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. 2) is it probable that i'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or 3) on game day? i figure since it's early in the year, ryno's out and the weather isn't great i should be able to get tickets. if not, what's the best way to get advance tickets; can i call the cubs' ticket office directly and pick up tickets at the will call window? 3) any advice on where to eat before or after the game? 4) do they allow inflatable i-luv-ewe dolls (present from lundy) into the bleachers? :-) -- dave hung like a jim acker slider kirsch blue jays - do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu new .. quotes out of context!

i would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or something. anyway, the worst pitcher on the yanks. if you mean currently on the team, then i have to go with scott "i'm a schizophrenic...no, i'm not!" kamienicki. sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings, but then he starts to go insane. a sure sign that he's losing his stuff (and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters and yell at himself. the worst all-time yanks pitcher? gotta go with ed "new york? i have to pitch in [gulp] new york?" whitson.

i love it how all of these people are "blaming" the phillies success on a weak division. why don't we look at the record of the teams in each division (read: inter-divisional play), we'll see that the east is really kicking the shit out of the west. i know it is early, but that is all we have to go on. atlanta is just so strong with their .188 ba, cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at veteran's stadium in philadelphia, and houston was swept in it's first three games by the phillies in the astrodome. that, my western division friends, shows that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you think!! phils all the way in '93 braves hit like a aaa club reds need marge 						-bob
i have noticed that this year has had a lot of high scoring games (at least the nl has). i believe one reason are the expansion teams. any thoughts? charles

no, he's not nuts, wip is second to none the sports station. they don't have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday night hockey because they suck. i live in richmond va, but i visit phila often, and on the way i get wtem washington) and wip. i hear the fan at night wherever i go (the signal used to be wnbc, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it. of those three, wip has the best hosts hands down. chuck cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is jody mac. wtem is too generic to be placed in the catergory. in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the theme music is identical...same ownership?? i think so! wip is totally original. their hosts actually have a personality (this is a knock at tem (the team) not the fan because mike and the mad dog and sommers are good) i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia to the ones in washington is a total joke. anyway, i like the fan and wip, but i think the edge goes to 'ip. when i get back from philly, i go into withdraw cause richmond has nada except the national sports line (and those guys are totally clueless) i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games. (wcau is another strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they still have the phillies) i started listening to the fan because i heard he went there. i finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same guy. those ny fans got to him. i was glad to hear him back in philly when i went to see a few eagles games. i will admit, i am die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an eagles station 365 days a year. but, i bet you the phillies are in control right now. about the knock on g. cobb, i like him. he knows the eagles like a book. i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran, (when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away) cobb said that the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win. well they were inches shy of pulling the victory. well that's my $.02
since someone brought up sports radio, howabout sportswriting??? (anyone give an opinion) which city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of print media? (these are general questions) is the washington post better than the philadelphia inquier or the ny times? howabout the philadelphia daily news compared to the new york daily news? do you notice papers being subjective or objective to the home team?
>something else to consider: >alomar's h-r splits were .500-.363 slg, .444-.369 obp! baerga's was .486-.424 >and .392-.318. pretty clearly, alomar got a huge boost from his home park. not necessarily. it could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see frank thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example). i would guess that some of alomar's split is due to the skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. there's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and alomar is not a home run hitter. >i'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. t&p >rated baerga higher, actually. only because of t&p's bogus fielding stats, which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league. on a career basis, i think t&p's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this. alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball. offensively, t&p rate alomar much higher last year. regarding the a vs. b argument, i'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. greg

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death, but i haven't seen anything in rsb yet. gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run. he stroked a line drive into the right field corner. the ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd. darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball. a fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball. home run. now i've seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind darryl's. several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry. what cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing. he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch. that exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when strawberry went into a tirade at the man. all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the dodgers a game. shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch. dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area. in an interview after the game, lasorda blamed the fan for the loss. strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning. l.a. times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch. before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play. was the fan wrong? should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference? or was he human and just reacting? by the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible. others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games. i question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line. had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball. but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan. --	the beastmaster -- mark singer mss@netcom.com
went to the dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night. astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. in the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home. another single made the score 2-0 cards. lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler, reed, and piazza batting third! darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster. piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 cards. the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman. by the fourth inning, astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2. the dodger defense made several impressive plays. piazza looked great behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc. karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield. the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second. karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third. my heart sank in the 7th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen. astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, dodger fans just knew it was over. gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen. the 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday. gross lived up to his name. he walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded. after a grounder resulted in a force at home, zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 cards. gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the cards had stolen a fourth run. the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that. meanwhile, the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. lee smith pitched the ninth. he had little trouble getting karros and wallach (does anyone have trouble with wallach these days?). cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount. smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza. if piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors. though its really early, karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year. the final score...cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits. dodger

"two big bats." hrm. i like justice, but i find mr. gant's trend disturbing. call it one and a maybe. the braves' platoon is ok, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. bream vs. lh and hunter vs. rh are awful. i'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. if the cf platoon hits .300, i'll retrace mr. likhani's midnight run down forbes, and i live in ny and la.

a lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster, but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used. he is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game. so to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule: if the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game. given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers. the 3rd catcher could be playing in aaa or be a non-roster bullpen catcher. ken

or are you willing to consider empirical evidence? teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division. if they don't make the post-season, they don't win the series. will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting? if so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games. in your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed. while many of us are thinking things like "base- runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like "it's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today". the result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players. perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field. after all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it. therefore, i could be an extremely valuable player. did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays' victory? probably, but how do you know? if you replace him with andres galarraga, perhaps the jays would have won, perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had winfield been dhing for toronto). was babe ruth a good player? he played on some ws-winning teams, but did he have anything to do with their success? it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player, and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder weren't. it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof. now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically and by looking at the rulebook. it is necessary to score more runs than one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one's opponent from scoring. runs are scored while a team is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year. we do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you. to make some flat predictions: barry bonds will have a higher obp+slg than gene larkin this year. the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings. the tigers will score more runs than the royals, but will also give up more. i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false, and, i suspect, so would you. as a matter of fact, i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year, given 3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random chance (and almost statistically significant). if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods, however fuzzy. > >it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally >meaningless. > so how about "real life"?

say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always testing this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time). you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so all previous evidence is meaningless?

(btw, by my definitions, the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team win. i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.) baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most cases.) morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter, robby alomar, tom henke, juan guzman, john olerud, et al. clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham, luis rivera, and jeff reardon. to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components (as i do, albeit imperfectly) is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you do) clay d.

a few weeks ago i posted about the phillies team personalities. did anyone see the espn feature on the phils on monday night. john kruk had a great line. he was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury. he said if they do they know we'll kick their ass. the time i saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped. when i saw it at they bleeped "ass." mitch williams talked about the team being a bunch of throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close. kruk said that they all get along this year. last year, he said, they hated the pitchers. i assume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks. oh, what a team!!!!! rob koffler -- ****************************************************************** |you live day to day and rkoffler@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu| |dream about tomorrow --don henley | ******************************************************************

you want to speed up ballgames? 1. enforce the two minutes between innings. as it is, many fields are allowing three minutes between them. fifteen seconds before tv commercials are gone to, thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game. two minutes, last out to first pitch, or a ball is called. 2. don't grant time to batters just because they want it. they may get pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike. 3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current rule is too lenient), and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more than enough time. if the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball, and restart the clock. baseball games take about 2:51 in the nl, and just a shade under 3 hours in the al. that's just too damn long. i don't like to play in 3 hour games, much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep, and if i'm watching on tv, i'll channel surf between pitches, catching colorized versions of mr. ed, leave it to beaver, and "those wacky nieporents" on nick at nite. -- * gary huckabay * "you think that's loud enough, a$$hole?" * * "movie rights * "well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir, * * available thru * i'd be happy to turn it up for you. i didn't * * ted frank." * know that many people your age liked king's x." *

if so, then consider that clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. in fact, jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens' career era. but i forget, in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had morris been on the sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right? >whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement >is totally meaningless. the object of the game is not to compile >high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important. >the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories. but this >has been patiently explained to you many, many times and you are >either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it. speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask. >>don't give me that shit. if boston had alomar, olerud, henke, and >>ward while toronto had rivera, jack clark, jeff reardon, things would >>have looked a little different last fall. give credit where credit is >>due. this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick. >yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit too...forget about what >didn't happen and open your eyes, for once, and look out there and >see what is really happening. forget about how morris "shouldn't" >have won 21 with an era over 4. >when morris pitched, last year, the jays won. stop crying about it and >get on with life. no one is crying; the jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east. they performed well in two short series and won the world series, and i congratulate them for it. as a red sox fan, i hope they keep morris. i was happy when they picked up stewart, and elated when they traded for darrin jackson. you see, unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16. seriously, roger, i'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 morris and the 1992 morris. which one was a better pitcher, and why? did morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years? if so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than 1992? mike jones | aix high-end development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com don't be humble, you're not that great.

the *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams: for all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10 minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5 hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500). for all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120. (if the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to first he would get $7500). i suspect you could finance this the same way presidential campaigns are paid for. offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says "i want 5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses"... -- ====================================================================== domain: tahorsley@csd.harris.com usmail: tom horsley uucp: ...!uunet!hcx1!tahorsley 511 kingbird circle delray beach, fl 33444 +==== censorship is the only form of obscenity ======================+ | (wait, i forgot government tobacco subsidies...) | +====================================================================+

yes - everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are finally moving in the right direction. they should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august. however, i would take back a few moves: 1. the jim abbott trade. i think abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a great pitcher also. he could win the cy young this year, but he won't because the right side of the yanks infield isn't good enough. so why was this not a good trade? jt snow. how many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the angels? i know it's early, but if you've seen this kid hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player. the yanks should have kept him. what about mattingly, you ask? well - it's great that the yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years older than snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as before his back injury. it's a shame, but as a yankee fan who wants to see the *best* yankee team, i'd take snow over mattingly at first. the yanks also gave up two promising propects with snow for abbott. besides, with domingo jean, brien taylor, wickman, militello, and sterling hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects. i know abbotts only 26, but this was too much to give up. i believe george forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that abbott will be a big hit in ny. however, i'd like to see the yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show. 2. wade boggs. i live in boston and like wade a lot. but, his career is winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop a long term solution (i.e. hensley muelins, russ davis, velarde?). besides, wade just doesn't have any range. what a shame about charlie hayes, huh? 3. spike owen. see wade boggs. i'd much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever. wade and spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the yankee staff era 1/2 point. and these guys are on the down sides of their careers. 4. danny tartabull. yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. but he never is. we should expect 120 games max out of him. meanwhile, gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o'neil is playing left field! i believe o'neil led nl outfielders in assists last year - and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder. what i'm basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year. they should (at the gm level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they will be ready in a year or two. i'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner. certainly, the boggs deal was all george. it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now. the veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like boston did this year). develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the yankees case, just keep them). let's all us yankee fans hope that george doesn't dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect. i'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example). george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away. have patience george and we will all enjoy the future. fire bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time! sam "i'm not militello or millitello" mandelbaum.

that's very true. i live in richmond, home of the aaa richmond braves, and they have this guy ryan klesko who hit 17 hr's at home last year. now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, but the way the "diamond" is built, home runs are a rarity. in fact, ron gant, brian hunter and david justice all proved they could hit in richmond. when they were sent to the majors, they never came back. if you can hit in richmond, you can hit anywhere. so far, after beating scranton (phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the best team in aaa history has been rather underwhelming. too many expectations i guess.

npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy (name possibly garbled by me), an official historian for the cia. she has won an emmy for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing but which sounds good). she said that among other things, berg was the principal spy for the oss (cia's wwii precursor) spying on axis atomic programs, because of his physics background and language skills. she said that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland, and had instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him). (i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb program, but i don't know how reliable this is.) unfortunately, npr didn't mention any kind of a book she's writing -- i'd certainly buy it. (in case you're wondering about baseball relevance, berg was a longtime mlb backup catcher. he was a member of an mlb all-star team that toured japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few americans, much less mlb players, who spoke japanese. photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids, according to mccarthy.) dave mb

tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year's defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run-value of defensive performances, compared to league average. i've combined those with my position-adjusted mlv numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year. we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award. major caveats: these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies. the offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair. finally, we still don't know what to do about catchers, and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of tony phillips and bip roberts. having said that, there are still some surprises. let's look national league first. all numbers in total runs contributed over the season. 	player		offense		defense		total 	sandberg	 44		 32		 76 	bonds		 67		 3		 70 	walker		 26		 26		 52 	justice		 14		 33		 47 	daulton	 	 44		 ??		 44+? 	larkin		 36		 4		 40 	grace		 13		 27		 40 as i see it, these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season. if you deflate sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley, you get essentially a dead heat. had bonds been his usual defensive self, it wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case. darren daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference, and i couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible. a good case could be made for any of sandberg, bonds, or daulton as top dude. my personal vote: bonds, sandberg, daulton, walker, justice. in the american league: 	player		offense		defense		total 	ventura		 22		 34		 56 	martinez	 47		 -1		 46 	b. anderson 	 21		 25		 46 	thomas		 47		 -5		 42 	r. henderson	 25		 16		 41 	raines		 17		 23		 40 	tettleton	 33		 ??		 33+? ok, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year? i certainly didn't, but i'd have a hard time arguing against him at this point. yes, i know these numbers are only approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy. also, those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds. once again, there's a catcher in the ointment. if calling a game is as important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away). take a guess, folks; i don't think we can do any better than that. my personal vote (excluding pitchers): 	ventura, tettleton, anderson, martinez, henderson. i'm a big frank thomas fan, but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher leverage in w/l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense. for the record: 	carlos baerga		 27		 5		 32 	roberto alomar		 35		 -2		 33 forget it; it's a wash. let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattingly's defense this past season. don recovered brilliantly from his weak '90 and '91 to end up with 	mattingly		 -1		 17		 16 runs which is clearly an above-average first baseman. however, it's still 18 runs behind mark mcgwire, 26 runs behind frank thomas, and 7 runs behind john olerud. on the other hand, it's ahead of rafael palmeiro, cecil fielder, and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned. -- david m. tate (dtate+@pitt.edu) | greetings, sir, with bat not quick member iie, orsa, tims, sabr | hands not soft, eye not discerning | and in denver they call you a slugger?

to encourage the great tradition of red sox negativism, i am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the sox' fall from their current heights. you must decide first, whether the sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year. then you must predict either: (1) their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or (2) their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year. so valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you were serious, val!). espn pointed out last night that the last sox start better than this was in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place. so email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly replying to this post. entries close 5 pm pdt on wed 28 apr 1993. dave mb

(yes, i can add. runs are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and i rounded off for simplicity). an all-replacement fielding team would have: randy milligan at first (.282), willie randolph (.269) at second, leo gomez (.279) at third, walt weiss (.269) at short, kevin bass (.271) in left, hojo (.257) in center, and eric anthony (.277) in right. ugh. so, the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding rar. i can rate them by total rar, or rar per some number of batting outs, like 400. an average player has a total rar of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding. total rar (bat/field) 1. bonds 152 (124/28) ventura 124 (66/58) 2. sandberg 143 (88/55) thomas 122 (110/12) 3. van slyke 122 (91/31) anderson 109 (75/34) 4. grace 114 (70/44) raines 100 (68/32) 5. lankford 111 (76/35) puckett 98 (76/22) 6. pendleton 108 (71/37) alomar 98 (75/23) 7. finley 104 (70/34) martinez e 97 (81/16) 8. bagwell 101 (73/28) mack 93 (70/23) 9. butler 96 (74/22) mcgwire 93 (79/14) 10 sheffield 96 (85/11) griffey 92 (70/22) 11 larkin 96 (65/31) devereaux 89 (56/34) 12 grissom 95 (57/38) henderson 88 (66/23) 13 walker 94 (61/33) listach 87 (50/37) 14 justice 92 (52/40) lofton 85 (46/39) 15 w. clark 91 (73/18) baerga 83 (55/28) 16 kruk 82 (78/ 4) d. white 79 (39/40) 17 o. smith 80 (46/34) palmeiro 76 (54/22) 18 gwynn 80 (47/33) sierra 76 (52/24) 19 hollins 80 (68/12) carter 73 (57/17) 20 j. bell 79 (42/37) gonzalez 73 (60/13) notable entries in a per-400 batting out rating, nl: top 7 are bonds, 177, lf; sandberg, 130, 2b; van slyke, 114, cf; grace, 107, 1b; larkin, 102, ss; justice, 99, rf; sheffield, 99, 3b. one at each position measured! mcgriff, despite +85 batting rar, fifth in league, finishes out of the top 20 due to a -13 in fielding. last by position: galarraga 39, stillwell -10, hansen 30, belliard 30 (blauser gad a 69, 3rd in league), may 43, dascenzo 34, anthony 38. in the al, much-maligned rickey henderson was worth 120, second only to frank thomas' 124; ventura edges edgar at third, 116-111; grebeck rates a potent 102!; griffey edges puckett as top cf, 93-90; listach nudges out lofton among rookies, 82-80. and alomar clearly outpoints baerga, 97-73. last by position: segui 10, sojo 29, palmer 22, lewis 31, polonia 40, cuyler 26, v. hayes 39. all for now. clay d.

umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time. only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's or hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time. the batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch. i'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and the minute for warm-ups. but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch. the same goes for pitchers. umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball will be called. that's the way it should be. ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine io20456@maine.maine.edu
it depends. if, in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit, the batter is awarded first for a base on balls. if the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way, he's awarded first because of a hit batsman. ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine io20456@maine.maine.edu
pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off) within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15. pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends, not two minutes. and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is simple: different mound, different catcher. ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine io20456@maine.maine.edu

the red sox usually have 2 catchers. i don't think they have a backup now, but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle infielder and outfielder. you don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field. -- john carr (jfc@athena.mit.edu)

i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip(i go to school in philadelphia, and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis.) now that the fan has mike lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show, but he had bob costas and magic johnson on too. now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: morning show: in my opinion, i think imus is much better than bruno, cataldi, and morganti, even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with. to me, wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme. in terms of sports, imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 am to 12 noon: i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round. lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests, but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story. i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host. 12 noon to 2 pm: at this point, i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks. i just think jm has the ability to transcend the "homer" mentality of the philadelphia fan base. this is most evident when the iggles(philadelphia spelling) play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan. where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:wip morning 'guys') i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts. i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin. if you are in ny and you can't get wip, jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes. 2pm to 4pm: this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and russo(fatso and froot loops) and i become the most divided in my loyalties. mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports. matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate. another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning, which are often hilarious. 4 pm to 7 pm: matd go up against fredericks and missanelli. i like mike missanelli but i just can't stomach steve fredericks. i know that sf came from philly originally, but when he was at the fan, he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now. i don't listen to wip much after 4 pm unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason. that is why i give the advantage to fan. 7 pm to midnight: s&m are on wip until 8 and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, g cobb. this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nuts.(i know that is biased, but listen to his show) on fan, there is usually a game on, knicks, rangers, mets jets, or st. john's basketball. if the game is on the west coast, then it is usually howie rose. of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip, but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season. (if this is the sports station, why did they lose the iggles to wysp(home of howard stern in phil.)) during the summer, it is all talk on wip. overall, i would have to give the advantage to wfan, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where wip has the advantage. rich -- "you've read the hat, now see the movie." -imus in the morning "a blurb? you're a blurb!" -seinfeld

off and on over the last several months, threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (risp) that he bats with. in the brock2 model, bill james calculated predicted rbis as rbi=.235*(total bases) + home runs. this completely ignores the context, which was all that brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it. so i thought i'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (rbi-home runs) to slg*risp. i've started with team data, using data from the elias's that i've picked up over the years when a) i could afford them and b) i could stomach the thought of increasing elias's profits. that gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990. (i don't have team rbis for '87 or i could add that year.) if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get (rbi-home runs) = 0.81*slg*risp. the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level. so, i feel like the fit is good at the team level. i've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (will clark, ozzie smith, joe carter, and don mattingly). i hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year. it doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter (smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie. the results: rbi-hr years actual predicted carter (84-88,90) 400 402.6 clark (87,88,90,92) 269 269.6 matt'ly (84-88,90) 471 460.8 smith (84-88,90) 317 280.6 i think we can make a case (and i hope to make it stronger) that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up. more later, harold -- harold brooks hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu national severe storms laboratory (norman, ok) "i used to work for a brewery, too, but i didn't drink on the job." -p. bavasi on dal maxvill's view that florida can win the nl east in '93

just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers (one of my least favorite) in la (sweet!). also the mets (my other least favorite team) loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight. big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs. hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners lob will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeile's off year). i don't know why all the fuss about the fillies. the media and all the filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings. give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we'll see who is in first then. i believe the cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference. on a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the dodger defense. he was asked where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied "fair." i remember it being in the "they said it" section of sports illustrated. i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in. go redbirds!! gary wieman

(the handbook, but not the scoreboard). to the best of my knowledge, the only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section of the handbook, and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook. 2.) the debate over elias goes way back. bill james' early stuff was hampered by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price. project scoresheet, and later, stats were founded to fill this void. you can call stats, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course. or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself. having attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past (football, not baseball), they just don't do that. in stats eyes, the high ground comes from making the information available at all. 3.) that being said, i'm pretty dissapointed by bill's book this year, too. i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than april. hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.

as the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not batting 4th for the giants behind will clark. barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the national league. imho, to have williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting 4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the giants.

tim belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as cincinnati won their second straight 5-0. pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats. belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed. early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine. in a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--i should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls. tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter bip roberts. bobby kelly followed with a single and barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right. the big guys (mitchell, sabo, milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a tomlin wild pitch. in fact, it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0. randy milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple. milligan would later score on reggie sanders' sacrifice fly, giving cinci the 3-0 lead after 4. the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing tomlin. barry later would score the final run on tom prince's two-base passed ball. the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when merced and kevin young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the "bunt" variety), but carlos garcia struck out, prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter lonnie smith "k'd" to end any pittsburgh hope. pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well, though: relievers blas minor, moeller (sp?), and nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work. barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb. he was taken to the hospital for "precautionary x-rays". let's hope he's ok. cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar! pittsburgh is now 7-6. *********reds fans*************************** if you would like to receive this report on a semi-daily basis (as often as i write it), send me your e-mail address and i'll put you on the list. if someone has a reds mailing list, please forward it to me and i'll put everyone on the list!! ********************************************* cincinnati reds 			ab	r	h		k	bb	lo -----------------------------------------------|--------------------------- roberts 2b		4	2	2		1	0	1 kelly cf		4	1	1		0	0	0 larkin ss		3	1	3		0	0	0 branson ss		0	0	0 		0	0	0 mitchell lf		4	0	1		1	0	0	 hernandez lf		0	0	0		0	0	0 sabo 3b			4	0	0		1	0	1 milligan 1b		4	1	1		2	0	1 sanders rf		3	0	0		2	0	0 oliver c		4	0	2		2	0	0 belcher p		4	0	0		2	0	1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- totals			34	5	10		11	0	4 3b milligan (off tomlin, leading off fourth, scored) 2b roberts (off tomlin, leading off first, scored) roberts (off tomlin, leading off fifth, scored) larkin (off tomlin, in fifth, one out, runner on second, rbi, scored) sf sanders rbi larkin 2, sanders sb kelly, larkin gdp sabo pittsburgh pirates 			ab	r	h		k	bb	lo -----------------------------------------------|--------------------------- martin lf		4	0	0		0	0	1 bell ss 		4	0	0		1	0	0 van slyke cf		4	0	0		0	0	0 king 3b			3	0	0		2	1	0 merced rf		3	0	1		1	0	0 young 1b		2	0	1		1	0	0 garcia 2b		3	0	0		2	0	1 prince c		3	0	1		0	0	0 tomlin p		1	0	0		0	0	0 minor p		0	0	0		0	0	0 smith ph 		1	0	0		1	0	2 moeller p		0	0	0 		0	0	0 waynor ph		1	0	0		1	0	0 nagel p		0	0	0		0	0	0 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 			29	0	3		9	1	4 gdp merced --------------------------------------------------------------------------- cincinnati	2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 ----- 5 11 1 pittsburgh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ----- 0 3 0 pitching 			ip	r	er	h	k	bb cincinnati	 belcher (w 1-1)		9	0	0	3	9	1 cg (1), so (1) $$$line of the day!!!$$$ e- larkin pittsburgh tomlin (l 0-1)		4 1/3	5	5	9	6	0 minor			2/3	0	0	1	0	0 moeller			2	0	0	0	3	0 nagel 			1	0	0	1	2	0 wp- tomlin pb- prince umps rippley/hallion/quick/crawford att-9,077 t-2:14 coming up: the reds play two more in pitts, then go to chicago for a weekend series. the weather doesn't look good, though-- don't be surprised if one or more games get rained out. tomorrow, 7:35, jose rijo vs. steve cook, then smiley vs. wakefield on thursday. rstimets

hey folks, saw the giants play ball at the 'stick saturday, april 17. it was the game where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out, two-run homer to right to win it. (it wasn't the game where the fans threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer -- too bad, huh?) well, the 'stick is still cold. the saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it was cold then. i can't imagine night games in april at the 'stick. the wind kicked up a little, too, and i got this idea. at most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time. i propose a kid's clean-up corps composed mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the toro smooths the infield) and grab the trash. it might not be glamorous, but at that age i probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers. everybody wins here! whaddaya think? sean

did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night? he addressed this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly. according to gammons, advanced scouts are reporting that morris' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release. guzman and stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach. gammons looks to see morris back in top form within the month. i, on the other hand, still have my doubts. morris' era last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games. his showing in the series was not surprising. although i'm not convinced that he's washed up, i have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the twins in '91. 							-brian klaff

(of course, the na is not considered a "major" league by officialdom.) over five seasons, meyerle hit .368 in the na. he also played for the first three seasons of the nl, hitting .329. -- -------------------------- phil brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu | --------------------------

is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi's? this is the situation that brought the question up: the red sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1. the mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out. the batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches. the runner at third tags and scores without a throw. now, without a judgement call (and i don't think there is one), this is an rbi for the batter. it seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensive indifference", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point. (i know, i can think of several "if the mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too. but does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you're down by 4? if the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.) the point is that the batter (imo) shouldn't get "credit" (an rbi) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not trade an out for one run. what do you guys think? 				regards, 				burke (charles s. homan) 				choman@wpi.wpi.edu 				go red sox!!!

total baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive and defensive contributions, gives barry bonds a total player rating of 9.0 for 1992. only one other player since ruth attained that mark: cal ripken for his 1984 season. rounding out the top five offensive players in the nl last season: sheffield, 5.9; sandberg, 5.8; van slyke, 5.3; and larkin, 4.7. the top 5 offensive players in the al in 1992 were: e. martinez, 4.8; ventura, 4.8; anderson, 4.5; r. henderson, 4.4; and thomas, 4.4 in short, total baseball says bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by mantle, mays, williams, etc. (if you disagree, don't flame me; flame the writers of total baseball.) also, martinez and ventura are neck and neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one had the better year can be considered a toss-up. thus, total baseball supports your choices of bonds and ventura as the mvps of 1992. -- -------------------------- phil brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu | --------------------------

i like the clark-williams-bonds order. pitchers can only walk clark with 2 outs (unlike last year). williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the on-deck circle. since matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the giants a lot. when bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson, manwaring, or clayton. if you bat bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a big inning. also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double). the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the bases infront of bonds... and i think that's a problem the giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot. ken kubey kubey@wpd.sgi.com (415) 390-3536

my father is a huge tiger fan, and i am a loyal blue jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85. i don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out. first of all, morris in his heyday (81-88) vs clemens (86-present). how many cy youngs does morris have? how many cy youngs does clemens have? ballparks and such... fenway average pitchers park. detroit, hugh hitters paradise. morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the doug drabek mold. if morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in minn in 91, morris snaps the ball, and throw for ks. otherwise, he just tries to get people out. as for clemens, in the elias stat book of 1992, i believe that clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to when he doesn't pitch. how bad would the red sox have been last year without him? can you say 92 phillies? i believe clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi great tenacity. morris is among the guttiest pitchers i;ve ever seen, but clemens is in a class with seaver, carlton, etc. paul sparks

(i know you're another long-term braves fan :) about playing 3b...imo, that's the 2nd most difficult position to field, after catcher. at ss or 2b, you need more range and speed, but at 3b, you've got to have quick reflexes and have a gun for an arm. there are no second chances at 3b, even when playing sandlot softball! granted, i'd still put my best overall infielder at ss, but that's because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder. it still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3b. but maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3b is scarce. finally, gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve. you don't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work. now, whether he's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. but frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, i'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough. you might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age i don't believe you can teach hustle. all that said, i don't think i'd sign gant to another long-term contract. he's 28 now, and i think he's free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he'll be 30. given his career curve and limitations, i wouldn't expect him to last much past 35 as a ml ballplayer. he might surprise me here, but atlanta's got some talent on the farm, and i'd rather take my chances down the road with nieves et al. eric

(paraphrased by my memory and bias.) that seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like, "how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?" a more media-sensitive player might answer "the manager knows what he is doing. if he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then i am all for it." we'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl's response as petulant. personally, i think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted, except for personal stats. if i were darryl, i'd probably answer that question, "the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get paid for rbis. i think it is best for me to bat fourth, but i am willing to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team." or something like that. it would be helpful at salary time--my rbis were down because i was hitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player. since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free. remember, the media is of the belief that one's best rbi man should hit fourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is true. 					--jeff

i've been following the giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick. after watching giants hitters struggle last year, barry's swing was very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to clark (particularly clark as of late). it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well. i'm not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's. the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds. there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better. clayton's defense has been superb. mcgee seems to like leading off this year. manwaring is driving the ball. so on & so forth. i hope it continues...i think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching. for myself, i think the fresh start of magowan/baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year. joe loos loos@cup.hp.com
buck showalter just can't win. bob wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (yanks lead 6-1), so buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game. wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and wickman just can't get the third out. so buck goes to the bullpen, and farr gets out the first guy he faces. last night, jimmy key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (yanks lead 4-0). this time, buck thinks, "i don't want a repeat of that near-fiasco with wickman, so i'll give my bullpen some work." steve howe, whose era was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. he didn't do too good. then farr comes in. he gives up a two-run homer, and the royals win it, 6-5. what's going on? this is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. farr & howe have done it twice together, monteleone's done it once, and i think even habyan did it once. what's the deal? we finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our bullpen turns to shit! what's buck gonna do? and what's george gonna do if this continues to happen? -alan

i've been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the giants mystique. or so i thought. i went to tuesday's game (3 - 1 giants over the marlins) and the 'stick was a much different place. nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but everything is a lot better. the lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are clean and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. the new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. the only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better. these things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real businessman (ex - safeway president peter magowan) to figure it out. just like he used to tell his checkers, "if the customers don't come back, i don't need as many checkers". this isn't a knock on bob lurie - he was a competent businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public. i'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. the onion dispenser jammed as i was using it. an attendant came over, apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. after he was done, he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. in the old days, there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "go to the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help". all in all, it was a fun day -- craig eid e-mail address craige@hpsad.sad.hp.com

i haven't been following the previous hr's. but there are two, that i saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!). 1) rick monday's hr to bury the expos in the nl championship in 1981. it was hit off steve rogers, who is a rhp and primarily a starter. why was he used as a reliever when the 'spos had reardon and billlee warming up in the bullpen. considering monday couldn't touch lhp, lee would have been a safe bet. he wasn't even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into montreal. the blast wasn't the important aspect. it was the timing. seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th. the expos almost came back though... 2) mike schmidt hit one that killed the expos in 1980. so close, yet, so far. and 3) strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago. it went off the technical ring in the big o. it almost left the stadium! that was hit hard!!! 				corelmark!

twins update -- posted april 22, 1993 --------------------------------------------- the twins defeated the milwaukee brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game homestand with the brew crew. the twins took two of three games in the series, with scores as follows: tuesday april 20th mn 10 mil 0 winning pitcher banks (2-0) wednesday april 21st mil 10 (10) mn 8 lp - hartley ( 0-1 ) thursday april 22nd mn 5 mil 4 wp - deshaies (4-0) sa - aguilera highlight/low lights of the series: ------------------------------------ jim deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the twins, but of the american league as well. going into today's game, deshaies was 3-0 with a 1.74 era. deshaies allowed 2 earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning his era will climb slightly. deshaies, who came to mn via a trade with philadelphia which sent david west there, continues to make andy macphail look like a true genius. willie banks has put together two solid starts for the twins, going 6.1 innings on monday while coasting on solid twins hitting. deshaies and banks now combine for 6 of the twins eight victories, while tapani/mahomes/erickson are 0-5. wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the twins this year (rickey bones). the twins teed off against both him and subsequent relief, including a grand slam by kent hrbek which pushed the lead to 7-3. the twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing 4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded. tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, guthrie two walks, and mike hartley one walk before the inning was over. this tied the game at 7-7, and the brew crew rocked mike hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win it. aguilera continues to be shaky against the brew crew. 6 of 20 career blown saves have come against the brew crew, and today's game was shaky as well. coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, aguilera gave up a solo hr to vaughn, then hits to darryl hamilton and dickie thon before finally retiring the side. once again, the tying run made it to second base on aggie. weak hearted twins fans are advised not to watch aggie in the ninth. general news ------------------------------------- pedro munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on tuesday's game. he continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching, though, which has limited his playing time. gene larkin and jt bruett(former gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed. the twins begin a three game series with the detroit tigers tomorrow. starting pitching is tentatively scheduled as erickson, mahomes, banks. the detroit tigers have had two 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide quite a challenge to the young mn pitching staff. the twins have 9 hr's this year, three each from puckett, hrbek, and winfield, the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively. brian harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second this year, and shows much improvement in this category. jim deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year. some say he has the best 1st base move in baseball. this move has enabled him to pitch out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 start. watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the rubber on the pick-off move. current mlb al west standings( from joesph hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu ) american west won lost pct. gb last 10 streak home road california angels 08 04 .667 -- 7-3 won 2 05-02 03-02 texas rangers 08 05 .615 0.5 5-5 lost 2 04-02 04-03 minnesota twins 07 06 .538 1.5 6-4 lost 1 04-04 03-02 chicago white sox 06 07 .462 2.5 4-6 won 1 02-03 04-04 seattle mariners 06 08 .429 3.0 4-6 won 1 04-03 02-05 oakland athletics 05 07 .417 3.0 3-7 lost 1 05-03 00-04 kansas city royals 05 09 .357 4.0 5-5 won 3 03-05 02-04

like clinton and reno, i accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster. my wife and i picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected sox offense. like all no-no's bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder by vaughn off t. martinez' glove but straight to boone who threw to bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense (many non-trivial groundouts). the game was amazingly fast, as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also working fast. the sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch. greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (i guess it has always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was an mvp candidate). wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently johnson made an "ok, i've got to stay focused" gesture which iron mike interpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the next two times. as valentine noted, last night he came up in the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game. can you say "take the first pitch"? not mike, who dribbled it into a 6-4-3. the pi quoted bosio that this was a "batting practice fastball". next time up he also hit the first pitch, a hard liner straight to kgjr in center. he also made the pathetic error and failed to catch boone's hr (which looked comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight reel that night). is riles suppsoed to be good defensively? i couldn't tell from the field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a dp that cost a run or two. why was he leadoff? i hope fletcher gets well soon. also on lineups, pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond me. it seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a hr and some good defense (a wag behind us said "he sure don't want to go back to calgary!") there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they'll likely lead off the second (as boone did). well, now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in langston. a reminder that contest entries are open through next wednesday -- i expect a surge of pessimism. by the way, ties will be broken by earliest entry. one entry per person or pseudonym, please, and easy on the pseudonyms. dave mb

i watched the final inning of bosio's no-hitter with several people at work. after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he wouldn't have had time to throw riles out. yet, the throw beat riles by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? and if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an error or a hit? (judging from bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) whether vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play. -- -------------------------- phil brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu | --------------------------

oh, yea, and chris bosio pitched a no-hitter. one over the minimum, two bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches. i listened to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a real treat (as long as they keep ron fairly quite, i doubt if anyone is better than niehaus -- but that fairly guy is really annoying me). but, i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching, it would have been a different story :-) two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in major league baseball .... pretty impressive in any league. man, if johnson, bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year. also, john cummings (rookie) has had three solid outings with no support. if fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year (relief is another story, though - grimace). too cool. the first no-hitter that i have been able to follow from start to end. and again, i think niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game. the guy is truly a joy to listen to -- he deserves a pennant race ... kent dietz twins in '93 mariners --- if only they were an nl team! follow?

"good hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have value. i don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but i'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar. it's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (but not as marked i suppose). michael

to all the braves doubters: don't worry. the bats will come alive, and the braves will come around. the pitching is solid, and as long the braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well. heck, with the five starters on the braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (i hope this doesn't happen, though). the bats are there... pendleton will certainly bat over .280, justice is catching fire, bream, nixon, sanders, gant... well, there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. right now, the cleveland indians have 7 players batting over .300! but i certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?). the bullpen... well, it is suspect. but when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern. so anyway, i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season. i'm not saying the braves have automatically won the division, but i'm optim- istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at times right now). go braves!!! dean.

note: i'm not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard, but as an independent sort of thread. i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as "sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what i want to say. maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (roger maynard) writes: >but the point is that the only decision making pro- >cess used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- >lates to the *teams*. not the individual players. there is no method >inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. and that >is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game. there's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism. in the biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of the game" and "organisms" for "teams". how we interpret "players" is trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make. a "genes" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, but that would be a different and probably longer post. if, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like "species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z". given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims. (but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map "species x" onto 'humans', and "organ z" onto 'brain'). on the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species y is a primate). even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.) however, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable. some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs. in a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms. >to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- >solutely that player a's team would have played better with player b >in their lineup. sheer speculation. impossible to ascertain. one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do. but, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty. most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research. >if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens >has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a >criteria, then fine. in this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses. >but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the >individual's contribution to winning the ws - because that is the only >measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball. this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another. moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league. in at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts. but in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball. the same is true in biology. but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal. in the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful. it might be fun to watch, but it's unclear what it all really means. *** now just one more un-related point: >i have yet to see that any of you can predict a >ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon. on the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. but this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference between the winners and the losers. moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage. >the stats are a nice hobby and that's about it. there is no new >knowledge being produced. since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats. but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful. speaking of which, i should get back to producing knowledge in a different field. that is, of course, if i can produce knowledge even though i'm relying on stats to do it. jking

i don't actually have the answer to this one. bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a "back-end" perfect game. how many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games? the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown. shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; shore picked him off and retired 26 straight after that. matt wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * hey, i gotta job here, ok? --------------------------------------------------------------- april 6, 1993: boston red sox seize first place.
just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing. he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders. i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad infinitum. *and* he gets the out, much of the time. some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing. you have to give mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag (yes, i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly :-) -- keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!! in this corner				let's go quakers!!!!! weighing in at almost every weight imaginable . . . life, and all that surrounds it.		 -- blues traveler, 1993

the original poster wanted to know how the big cat looked. i was also at the saturday game in montreal (apr 17) that rockies won 9-1. i haven't paid much attention to gallarraga since he left the expos but his stance seemed to be much different. he stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. i'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. he could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. if this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? as for his patience, dennis martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. if he was grooving pitches to andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). does andres generally start hot or cold? does it take until may for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away? roger healey

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population, and have suggested various "remedies", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that "smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation" is an accurate description of what is, essentially, a laid-back game. forget those lame ideas. here is my new and exciting two-point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses. point one: sex. point two: violence. let's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in america. here's how we can implement them in the game: sex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders. dancing on top of the dugouts. bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch. running up and down the stands. (the south bend white sox actually do this). violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing brawl". everybody just stands there and looks at each other. stand, stand, stand. look, look, look. ho, hum. then, the bullpens come running in. when they reach the "fight", they just stand there, too. anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined. further, the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield. football: sex, violence. basketball: sex, violence. hockey: violence. baseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn. bob vesterman.

	the term "stopper" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak. 	the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now i'd expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle. 	what the braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. there's just no one there. the braves got rid of their best pure hitter, lonnie smith, and only terry pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.	 	oh, and another thing that worries me. ron gant seems to have slowed down a step. that's scary. a slow ron gant doesn't have much going for him. -- @econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke. s to my correspondents: my email has been changed. e l my new address is: fls@econ.duke.edu d f if mail bounces, try fls@raphael.acpub.duke.edu u

(a very nice piece of information, ms. nichols. who knows? she may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.) those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*. something is being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games by 15 minutes. ms. nichols thinks it's more pitches. given the increasing specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me. if it's not simply more pitches, though, i don't think it's unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back. then i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules, which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones). the problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?" you don't seem to think it is at all. right now, i think it is, although i have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows? if the rules get changed, maybe something i didn't foresee will happen to change my mind. but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing, or else nothing will be changed. rg "i can play me better than anyone. there's only one of me." - barry bonds, on playing himself in two movies

to really speed up the game umps need to start calling strikes the way they used to. i'm talking about making the strike zone start at the knees and go up to the top of the letters. forget this "the strike zone is in the general area of the groin". a lot less 3-and-2 counts and a quicker game.
during the local rockies broadcast the other day don baylor went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up on the screen that it was the "so and so sponsored" pitching change. i saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored. at other times during the game rockies announcer duane kuiper was setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation that charlie jones would jump in and discuss the situation. but what does charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leaves duane hanging. duane's strategy proved prophetic. these examples happen over and over on radio and t.v. braodcasts making them sometimes very boring to listen to. i guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name to budweiser, nike, etc. i don't think it will be long until we hear: "nike budweiser drills it deep to left field, chevrolet goes back, back, it's gone! the apple macintoshes (formerly the boston red sox) are the 1998 world champions!!!" back to work, anthony m. jivoin national center for atmospheric research rsf/atd - fl1 p.o. box 3000 boulder, co 80307 p.s. rockies fans have the brooms ready for the marlins this weekend.

i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati. this would help so that the o's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason. training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent although i would prefer parent. #1 draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming up faster in the o's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. mike flanagan is trying for another comeback. big ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. this may be ben's year. 	i feel that while this may not be mussina's cy young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around august. i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o's need. orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. the o's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. the rotation should be sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, ?????. olson is an interesting case. will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? you never know. the way i see the al east this year (with personal biases mixed in) baltimore new york toronto milwaukee cleveland boston detroit (the top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. one of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in hell/maryland :). i feel that this baltimore's season to finally put everything together.) __________________________________________________________________________ |admiral steve c. liu internet address: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu| |"committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms | |and their rehabilitation into society" from red dwarf - "polymorph" | |****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!****| | this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	hello, my friends and i are running the homewood fantasy baseball league (pure fantasy baseball teams). unfortunely, we are running the league using earl weaver baseball ii with the comm. disk ii and we need the stats for the 1992 season. (preferably the 1992 major league stat disk) we have the '92 total stats but ewb2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200 inning games because the comm. disk turns total stats into vs. l's stats unless you know both right and left -handed stats. 	so, if anyone has the ewb2 '92 stat disk please e-mail me! __________________________________________________________________________ |admiral steve c. liu internet address: admiral@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu| |"committee for the liberation and intergration of terrifying organisms | |and their rehabilitation into society" from red dwarf - "polymorph" | |****the bangles are the greatest female rock band that ever existed!****| | this sig has been brought to you by... frungy! the sport of kings! | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
