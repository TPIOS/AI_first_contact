hi... i'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism? i've debated this quite a bit, and while i think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, i can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous. as evidence, may i quote the wall street journal (of all things!), april 2 (editorial page): "we suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the earth is sanctified. it's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the religious left, a secular, or even pagan fanaticism that now worships such gods as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions." (emphasis mine). thoughts? reactions? harangues?

i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract. it is a bit lengthy for a posting, but i thought i'd share it with all of you anyway. feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. may god richly bless those who read it. ======================================================================= d o e s g o d l o v e y o u ? q. what kind of question is that? anyone who can read sees signs, tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, "god loves you." isn't that true? a. it is true that god offers his love to the whole world, as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible: for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. john 3:16 however, god's love is qualified. the bible says: the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. proverbs 15:9 for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. psalm 1:6 q. but i am not wicked. i am a decent, moral person. surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done. how can these verses apply to me? a. by god's standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell. the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven. on the contrary, we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god. as it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after god. romans 3:10-11 the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? jeremiah 17:9 q. if i am such a wicked person in god's sight, what will god do to me? a. the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell. for a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. i will heap mischiefs upon them; i will spend mine arrows upon them. they shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. deuteronomy 32:22-24 q. oh, come on now! hell is not real, is it? surely things are not that bad. a. indeed, hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ- ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior. the bible makes many references to hell, indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering. and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. revelation 20:15 so shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. matthew 13:49-50 ... when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god, and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord, and from the glory of his power; 2 thessalonians 1:7-9 q. that is terrible! why would god create a hell? a. hell is terrible, and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions. god's perfect justice demands payment for sin. for the wages of sin is death; romans 6:23 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 corinthians 5:10 but i say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. matthew 12:36 q. does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell? a. indeed it does; that is, unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins. that someone is god himself, who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him. all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. isaiah 53:6 but he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. isaiah 53:5 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received, how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1 corinthians 15:3-4 for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of god in him. 2 corinthians 5:21 q. are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute, who was already punished for my sins, then i will not have to worry about hell anymore? a. yes, this is so! if i have believed in christ as my savior, then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god. christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins. he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the son shall not see life; but the wrath of god abideth on him. john 3:36 q. but what does it mean to believe on him? if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior, then am i saved from going to hell? a. believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible. it means that we hang our whole lives on him. it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible. it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord. no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. ye cannot serve god and mammon. matthew 6:24 repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord; acts 3:19 q. are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus? what about all the other religions? will their followers also go to hell? a. yes, indeed. they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account- able for our sins. god demands that we pay for our sins. other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers. christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us. neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. acts 4:12 jesus said: i am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me. john 14:6 if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 john 1:9 q. now i am desperate. i do not want to go to hell. what can i do? a. you must remember that god is the only one who can help you. you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god. as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to god to save you. and the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, god be merciful to me a sinner. luke 18:13 ... sirs, what must i do to be saved? and they said, believe on the lord jesus christ, and thou shalt be saved, ... acts 16:30-31 q. but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him? a. wonderfully, god not only saves us through the lord jesus, but he also gives us the faith to believe on him. you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior. for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of god: ephesians 2:8 god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith. so, if you really mean business with god about your salvation, you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible, which is the only word of god. in this brochure, all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs. give heed to them with all your heart. so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of god. romans 10:17 q. but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god? a. yes. god wants us to come to him in total humility, acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in him. the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, o god, thou wilt not despise. psalm 51:17 because we are sinners we love our sins. therefore, we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins. and if we sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us. we know that our sins are sending us to hell. unto you first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. acts 3:26 q. doesn't the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized? will these save me? a. if possible, we should do these things, but they will not save us. no work of any kind can secure our salvation. salvation is god's sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas- ure. salvation is not of works, lest any man should boast. ephesians 2:9 q. what else will happen at the end of the world? a. those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever- more. for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of god: and the dead in christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the lord. 1 thessalonians 4:16-17 q. what will happen to the earth at that time? a. god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever- more. but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. ... nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 peter 3:10,13 q. does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come? a. yes! the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save. and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. matthew 24:14 q. can we know how close to the end of the world we might be? a. yes! god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not come as a thief for the believers. there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very, very close.* all the time clues in the bible point to this. for when they shall say, peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 1 thessalonians 5:3 surely the lord god will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. amos 3:7 q. but that means judgment day is almost here. a. yes, it does. god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning. and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, yet forty days, and nineveh shall be overthrown. jonah 3:4 q. what did the people of nineveh do? a. from the king on down they humbled themselves before god, repented of their sins, and cried to god for mercy. but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto god: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. who can tell if god will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? jonah 3:8-9 q. did god hear their prayers? a. yes. god saved a great many people of nineveh. q. can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg- ment? a. yes. there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short. how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; hebrews 2:3 in god is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in god. trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: god is a refuge for us. psalm 62:7-8 a r e y o u r e a d y t o m e e t g o d ?

i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, catholic liturgy. in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass. it's driving me crazy! the most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it. led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god. but the best masses i've been to were participatory prayers. lately, i think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. example. last sunday (palm sunday) we went to the local church. usually on palm sunday, the congregation participates in reading the passion, taking the role of the mob. the theology behind this seems profound--when we say "crucify him" we mean it. we did it, and if he came back today we'd do it again. it always gives me chills. but last week we were "invited" to sit during the gospel (=passion) and _listen_. besides the orwellian "invitation", i was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away. this seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on. new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the mass is about to be done. in my mind, i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay "experts", but that may not be just. i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord's presence. so we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the mass going down? i don't mean that facetiously. we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god's presence. but as far as the obligatory sunday masses...maybe i should just offer it up :) has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately? john murray
regarding david wilkerson's prophecies. while i'm not real sure of his credibility, i do remember a book he wrote, called a vision or something like that. he made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially. at the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that. this prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where i worked were buying gold. the problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la jean dixon). does anyone know if there any of his predictions, perhaps from the book i mentioned, that can pretty definitely be said to have not come true? -- -fred gilham gilham@csl.sri.com "peace is only better than war when it's not hell too. war being hell makes sense." -walker percy, the second coming

"i know why he gave you that song," murillo said, "he didn't want it anymore." but god does still speak to his people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon. ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the spirit in the church of his day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a new testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today. he believed in a closed cannon. many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures. for example, one prophet in kings, whose name starts with an "m" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle. that is the only prophecy he gave recorded in scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, "he never prophesies anything good about me." yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture. there are numerous examples. barnabas was a prophet, acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle. yet his writings are not recorded in scripture. only two of agabus prophecies are mentioned in scripture. he was already a prophet before he gave them. so prophecy may be genuine and from god, but that does not make it scripture. >also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture. is it right to call >that prophecy? misleading? wouldn't that be more having to do with >knowledge? i don't know about translations of scripture, but i am familiar with prophecies that give applications for scripture. there are also similar examples in the bible. several times peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, "and his bishoprick let another take" concerning judas office. a clearer example can be found in matthew 24. jesus is prophesying about what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood. so scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy. sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the spirit seem to overlap. words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap. the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap. interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy. healings are often considered miracles. so sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy. imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the spirit, and use them according to his leading. link hudson.

i seldom see any posts in this group. is anyone out there in christendom listening? if so, why don't we get some dialog going here? here's a topic to get things started. my daughter's christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. this week they sent something *very* interesting. it was an article written by the leader of a national (us) christian school organization about a trip he recently made to jerusalem. while there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the temple at jerusalem. the article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the bible. what was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the israeli government before beginning the building. the other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war. now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. although the israeli government will give the permission to start, i think it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it happen. brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. our redemption is drawing near. look up!

in the discussion as to why jesus spoke aloud the "lazarus, come out", i'm surprised that no one has noticed the verse immediately preceeding. jn 12:41 "father, i thank you for listening to me, though i knew that you always listen to me. but i have said this for the sake of the people that are standing around me that they may believe that you have made my your messenger." (goodspeed translation) my guess is that the "lazarus, come out!" was also for the sake of the crowd. -- --- tim rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu rolfet@columbia.dsu.edu

	is life a pass/fail course, and does god grade on a curve? 	i'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but i want to know what some of you people think. specifically, are there an infinite number of heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves? or is it simply heaven or nothing (hell?) also, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method? is the person's childhood taken into account? 	i'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but i figure that you're the experts. 						-quinn [eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree. i suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic. however both jesus' teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death. on a number of occasions jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where jesus says things like "even xxx will be better off than you in the judgement." also, i cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were. but these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all christians would even go as far as that). the only christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the mormons, and they are very far from mainstream christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them christian). their ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations, in addition to the bible and "holy tradition" of a more generic christian sort. note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with god. the whole point of christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass. if you like test analogies, god grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading. while there are differences among branches of christianity on details, i think we all agree that in one way or another, god cheats. i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far god's cheating extends. will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts? many christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do. jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line. certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not. --clh]

{i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described. this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time. hl} the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass, "hermeneutrik und kritik," _einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _handbuch der klassischen altertums- wissenshaft_ (noerdlingen: beck, 1886). portions of this are described in nibley, _the prophetic book op mormon_, pp 219-242 (slc: deseret book, 1989). (if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned. nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.) nibley's extract from blass's work is in the form of "rules for forgers." it makes interesting reading. i confess that i have not read blass's work, only nibley's extract thereof. my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available. however, i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame. we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery. actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents: 1. alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof. for example the dead sea scrolls. these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them. this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects. 2. documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent. for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists). this is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple). we cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself. it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be. they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin. for example i've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq. if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph). they could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time. however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it. we would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there. there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was. as i say, i'm no expert on blas's work. i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works. specifically we might ask: 1. is the document internally consistent? does it contradict itself? if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery. the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents. 2. is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection. here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check. the devil is in the details. 3. what about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc. any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us. are there any such odd phrases in this book? if so do they fit in with the culture? of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it. a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies. they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery. these tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy. they require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc. the questions to ask are, "is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?" if there are things which don't fit how significant are they? are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant? there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture. the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain (particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies). however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions). this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials. it is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer.

firstly, i am an atheist. i am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience. the meaning of my existence is a question i ask myself daily. i live in fear of what will happen when i die. i bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that i'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus. i was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions.. i know the bible well. so well i can recognize many passages from memory. <<****strong opinions start here...****>> 1) the human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable. (for example the ancient greeks believed that apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real. due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false. christianity is an infectious cult. the reasons it flourishes are because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind. "oh wow..all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness." for all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?" but i digress... the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature. a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->priority #1 spread the word. we are _just_ animals. we need sleep, food, and we reproduce. and we die. religion (especially christianity) is nothing more than a drug. some people use drugs as an escape from reality. christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high. it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which christianity has had no small part. when christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day. jesus was just prophet #37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need. i must go. these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity. -- //damien endemyr the unpure knight of doom // //"so i've acquired a taste for blood and have adopted a nocturnal // //lifestyle. that doesnt mean i'm a vampire....." //

	i am a good catholic boy. a convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of anglicanism] to roman catholicism. i never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but i did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. i always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as john emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the bible as god's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the bible proved god. no, i was happy to accept the church as god's revelation. it was the church after all that existed before the bible, the church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. protestant ludicrosity, i thought, was shown by protestants breathtaking acceptance of luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. 	but recently i read peter brown's _body and society_. it is very well researched, and well written. but is raises some very upsetting questions. the early christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. they had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings. 	now the question is this: were the first christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine "fall of the church" happen within one generation. it certainly did'nt have to wait until the triumph of the church under constantine. if so, wha does this say about god's promise to always support the church. it's no use throwing the usual protestant pieties about the church not being an organization at me. it's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. the institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. 	i would be interested in serious catholic and orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. i'm not sure it is an issue for protestants with their "soul alone with jesus" approach, but for we who see the "ecclesia" as a "koinoia" over time and space, the weird early christians are a problem. [this is an exaggeration of the protestant view. many protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the church. "the soul alone with god" is certainly important for protestants, but it's by no means the whole story. i have read the sort of history you talk about. as you point out, protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a fall at some point. however protestant mythology typically places the fall around the time of constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from constantine but getting worse as the pope accumulated power during the medieval period.) the consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us. most protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the trinity and incarnation. indeed in the works of reformers such as luther and calvin, you'll find church fathers such as augustine quoted all the time. i think you'll find many protestants resistant to the idea that the early church as a whole was "wierd". (there is an additional problem for protestants that i don't much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of augustine and other fathers as being proto-protestants. their views on mary, the authority of the pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to protestant thought.) one thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. there are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church. what concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see. we see every christian who courted martyrdom. but i think there's good reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than that. we see the heroic virgins. but i think there's good reason to think that many christians were happily married. i can't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now. i think there's also a certain level of "revisionism" active in history at the moment. i don't mean that they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth. but don't you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel? --clh]

the two historic facts that i think the most important are these: (1) if jesus didn't rise from the dead, then he must have done something else equally impressive, in order to create the observed amount of impact.

[ . . . ] having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during mass, i find this comment interesting. there is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts without active participation. if you know the latin, one really beautiful way to hear the passion is it's being chanted by three deacons: the narrator chants in the middle baritone range, jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. this is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the passion that john would prefer. but there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation). the palm sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative. also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple masses for the sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to "get 'em in and get 'em out". each parish is different. catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes. it is possible that another catholic parish in the columbus area (based on the ohio state address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences. or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally are willing to listen to non-confrontational requests. though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ sunday mass. perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits). {my apologies if i am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.} -- --- tim rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu rolfet@columbia.dsu.edu

he doesn't contradict himself. the church is to last for all time. however, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves. this is evident in many letters. for instance, paul talks about the "super-apostles" to the corinthians (2 corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 timothy 4:3-4). such passages go throughout the letters and jesus does warn about them (matthew 24:4-14). but look at the promise in this last part. verse 14: "and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." even today, there are false teachings. i can name two which i am well familiar with: the non-need of baptism and the "praying of jesus into your life for salvation". both are taught. both are dead wrong. they have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up. the only way jesus taught is given in luke 9:23-26 and luke 14:25-33. he then commands baptism in matthew 28:18-20. the church jesus founded, though, is alive and well. it's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted. joe fisher > >peace, >lou > >+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ >+ lou nunez (e-mail lnunez@vaxa.stevens-tech.edu) + >+ + ps 42(43):4 + ps 90(91):5-6 + dn 3:52-90 + ml 1:11 + + >+ + ad altare dei + ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam + + >+ + 1cor 4:15 + mt 16:13-19 + 1cor 13:1-13 + luke 10:25-37 + + >+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

sorry for taking this off of sharon's resp, but i'd also like to add some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second q. verses: 1 corinthians 6:9-10 colossians 3:5-10 as for knowing when, that's a bit tricky. people normally have consciences which warn them about it. however, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are sinning. of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with. those take searching and examining of scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change. the best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is: "would jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?" i know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling question. joe fisher oh, i missed one. 1 john 1:8-2:11,15-23.

according to the scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there. as per a previous note, i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means. there are also differences of opinion and belief. however, scripture states: in the following directives i have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. in the first place, i hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent i believe it. no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god's approval (1 corinthians 11:17-19). how will god show his approval? by fruitfulness (see acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities: devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common. glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts 2:42-47. god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted. look at stephen, "a man full of faith and of the holy spirit" (acts 6:5) who was later stoned (acts 7:54-60). >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the > true church of jesus christ? one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement. i have yet to find that, but the closest one i've found is the boston church of christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected. it is also the only one i've seen which is totally sold out to god. > >a problem closely related to these question is: >- can we cooperate with other christians - from these two churches - > before there is a unity? this question is especially important > for those who think that only one church can be the "true one". > as for cooperation, that can always occur. unity, on the other hand may never occur. as for those who think about only one church being the "true one", i remind them that mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward. as with the boston movement, i've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples. of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. i know i haven't. >maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you. >for your information: we have a lot of organizations here which >are founded by people of one specific church and whose members >are all members of that church. this has been considered as >"correct" for years. only a few years ago people started to >discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process. >some organizations are opening their doors for people from >other churches etc. > i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me. a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively. this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions. i would not say at all that this is something "correct" for a church/group to do for any reason. in one of the churches i attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation. they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being "opened up" so that they would have to step right back in. their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (i wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple). anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there. so, i must warn against such division within. there's enough division without. >thanks for your opinions in advance! > >maarten joe fisher
were the early christians weird? yes! so were their non-christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late republican rome or the pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by renaissance and eighteenth century hero worship.) so are modern non-christians. and christians. you are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of luther and of protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about catholicism *not* being faddish. sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)). may i recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense philippe aries' book _the hour of our death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in western [specifically catholic] christendom? and it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first christian century. paul was pretty weird, too; as were peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around jesus. what i think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show your notions. we *are* commanded to love one another, after all. and brown's book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to see the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts. (if anything, brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-)) i don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early christianity *was* like the weird (christian and non-christian) cults we see today. to that extent, i think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.) but the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand. and it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.) i would advise, in other words, more historical reading (brown's other books are also good, most especially his bio. of augustine; also try robin lane fox's _christians and pagans_, maybe the paul veyne ed. _history of private life_, some of foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...) humanity *is* weird -- we have known one sane person, and we killed him. fortunately for us, this has proved a comedy rather than a tragedy. easter, 1993.

(john 14:12-14) so, jesus asked them to pray for things in his name. since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from jesus. remember that "there is one god and one mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time." (1 timothy 2:5-6. also, "there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. therefore he is able to save completely those who come to god through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." (hebrews 7:23-25). hebrews is also full of areas talking about jesus being our mediator rather than any other man. joe fisher ["the people before jesus didn't have jesus, right" may not be as obvious as you think. in what sense to you mean didn't have? christian thought has generally said that they had jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death. god is not bound by our chronology. so in some real spiritual sense they did "have jesus". even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicit knowledge that we have, christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of jesus, even if knowledge from afar. --clh]
the empty tomb: can we trust it? by the late wilbur m. smith, d.d. (1894-1977) when jesus was on earth, he made an amazing prediction about himself, and frequently repeated it. let me quote it for you: behold, we go up to jerusalem; and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him; and the third day he shall rise again" (matthew 20:18-19). wholly different from the normal experience of men, jesus, who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving reproval, knew he would die before he was 40 years of age. he knew the very city where he would die. he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death. he knew that one of his own would betray him. he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged. he knew exactly how he would die--*by crucifixion.* all this is in itself remarkable. but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried--*that he would rise again.* he even designated the time--on the third day. but since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec- tion of jesus christ--that the whole truth or untruth of chris- tianity turns, let us examine it more closely. the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed. the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against the entrance. the jewish authorities, fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body. early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body. to their utter astonishment, they found the stone rolled away, the body gone. they rushed back to tell the disciples. shortly two of jesus' friends, peter and john, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the tomb empty, just as the women had said. even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone (matthew 28:11). how did this tomb become empty? one of the most famous new testament scholars in america-- professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how* the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time. but he didn't realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time, *because there never was a santa claus!* ...and there *is* a jesus. he died; he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea, and on sunday the body was gone. those are facts of history. no one can escape the responsi- bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old. another professor, dr. kirsopp lake of harvard university, tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt) that the women went to the wrong tomb. the facts are these: first, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone. second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days. even if the women did miss the tomb, when peter and john came, did they too go to the wrong tomb? third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb? there is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself. now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying, say ye, his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. and if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. so they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is com- monly reported among the jews until this day (matthew 28:11-15). this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty. you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb *was* empty. they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true. another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that jesus' disciples came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!* how could they know what was going on while they were asleep? obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court. even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation, the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus. first, as professor heffern points out, the leaders of judaism in jerusalem, who had put the lord jesus to death, had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection--because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty. if there had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected, then proved. second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent. it may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most of these men did. the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it would have lost it *power.* instead, this truth swept the world, closed pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever. but not only did jesus come alive again, he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him. instead, he appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently. he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning (matthew 28:1-10); later that day to mary magdalene alone (john 20:11- 18); and to simon peter, also alone (luke 24:34). in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus (luke 24:13-35); and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem (mark 16:14-16; luke 24:36-40; etc.). a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at the same place (john 20:26-28). once he was seen by above 500 brethren on a mountain in galilee (i corinthians 15:6); and finally to the apostles just before his ascension (mark 16:19; luke 24:50-52; acts 1:3- 8). as with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor- ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness. but these theories are unreasonable, without supporting evidence. none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances. moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle. increase mather, president of harvard; timothy dwight, president of yale; nathan lord, president of dartmouth; edward hitchcock, president of amherst; mark hopkins, president of williams; john witherspoon, president of princeton--these men and countless others have believed it. but suppose christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it? what has it to do with *my* life? what has it to do with *your* life? just this: it seals with certitude the teachings of christ. jesus taught many great truths--especially many about himself. he claimed to have come down *from* god. he said he was the way *to* god. he said he was the son of god, who alone knew god perfectly. he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life, and no one else had it. he said that whatever we ask god in his name, he would grant it to us. thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day, he revealed that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *he spoke the truth!* do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe that his words are all true? the point is, does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be--the son of god? and then, of course, the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death, and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave, as he promised. in other words, if this person, jesus christ, the son of god, in all this, he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life. for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins, his compan- ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day. those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been many*--have given their testimony. and we today who believe also know.

(ps. 32:1). and quoted by the apostle paul: even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works, saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin. (rom. 4:6-8) the biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments. the dispensational distinction is unwarranted. > during the millenium, we read that sins are dealt with immediately >under the present (ie that christ is present on earth) rulership of christ. i'm sure rex has scripture to back this up. you're suggesting jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of his law -- for millions perhaps billions of people. such activity for moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. ex. 18:13ff). it makes for interesting speculation, though. i'll leave comments on the so-called "bema seat" vs. "throne" judgments to someone else. this also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism. -- tom albrecht

here's how i talk to non-christians who are complaining about hell. me:	"do you believe you're going to heaven?" him:	"i don't believe in heaven." me:	"so are you going there?" him:	"if there was a heaven, i would." me:	"but since there isn't a heaven, you're not going there, are you?" him:	"no." the point is that heaven is based on faith--if you don't believe in heaven, there's no way you're going to be in it. of course, the next step is, "i don't believe in hell either, so why will i be there?" it seems to me that hell is eternal death and seperation from god. most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never see god--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to hell. hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be hell--because it's eternal, and it's a lot worse than heaven. that's the only comparison that matters. alan terlep				 "incestuous vituperousness" oakland university, rochester, mi			 atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu				 --melissa eggertsen rushing in where angels fear to tread.		
i'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of "arrogance of christians" and look forward to any responses. in my encounters with christians, i find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth. according to them, their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of god and god is truth - thus they know the truth. this stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about christianity because they see no other way. their way is the 'truth.' but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way. that choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice. my discussions with some christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when i was in grade school: a kid would say, "all policemen are jerks!" i'd ask, "how do you know?" "because my daddy told me so!" "how do you know you're daddy is right?"

i don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you trying to convince? by its subject i would assume you are directing the argument towards people who do not believe that christ rose from the dead, but in your "proof," you use the bible exclusively. the post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held. as far as i know, there is no disagreement between christians over the resurrection of christ. so my question is: what is the purpose of this post? tomas -- "because no battle is ever won he said. they are not even fought. the field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools." william faulkner

being a parent in need of some help, i ask that you bear with me while i describe the situation which plagues me... i am a divorced father. chance would have it that "my weekend" with my daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this year. although i am presbyterian, i had married a catholic woman. we decided that the catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a christian church which was non-denominational. during the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. when our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as catholic. this wasn't a problem with me. during a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. she was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. it has since been treated "effectively". in other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society. during the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced buddism. her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only saturday visitation for a number of years. during this period i have read bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her christian heritage. last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. at that time i was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. at that time, i started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. i did this to attempt to strengthen the christian ethic and expose her to a religious community. today, easter sunday, i took my daughter to church. when it came time for communion, my daughter took the bread (the body of christ) but left the wine (the blood of christ) professing that she was too young for wine. she then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us. i feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. i really felt dishonored by the action. my daughter is only nine years old, but i think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. i have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when i discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity. my initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in christ then why does she celebrate easter, or christmas? i suggested i would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again. i do not want to "drive her from the fold", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing buddhism (as though i had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but i want her to want to embrace christianity. any suggestions? if you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

(moderator: this is a replacement for an earlier, more clumsily worded submission on the same topic which i submitted a few minutes ago.) i think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning. regardless of how the word 'easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to christians other than 'the feast day of the resurrection of jesus christ'. the meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean. and the same goes for other cultural practices. the festival of easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as i know, no christians who *intend* to honor any kind of "pagan goddess" by celebrating easter. it is nonsense to say "this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it." words and practices don't mean things, people do.

	the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time. the problem is, in a nutshell, this: the liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - water, blessings, vestments, altar, relics, etc - are real. that is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. the point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent. this kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply is holy. but, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. we are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. in concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for god's grace rather than the real thing. you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask coca-cola co.!]. these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. you can only create signs, symbols have to come from god [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. if the host is a sign of grace, this isnt and issue; but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus' body. modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift. we try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. this is not a soul filling experience. it doesn't help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of wesley and the 19c anglican hymn writers]. taize' is only slightly better. what are we to do? well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. search out a church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. they exist in every city. this is not btw a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. it is the attitude of the church that counts. also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-vatican ii days, does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative. in nyc i can recommend: 	corpus christi - w 12st st. 	corpus christi - w 12st st. - very conservative liturgy, 	st. joseph's, greenwich village. - modern, "clean", largely gay 	oratorian church, brooklyn - very beautiful avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles. happy easter: christos aneste', christos voskrezhne, christ is risen paul halsall halsall@murray.fordham.edu

(presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to hell (die a final death)) i don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when i am aware of my non-existence. (assuming i 'go to hell' and not to heaven) in other words, i'll never know i'm dead. hmmm... > hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be hell--because it's eternal, ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died: "at least she's not suffering any more; she's in heaven now." ? consider the following statement: "at least she's not suffering any more; she's in hell now." the above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of hell, it would be a true statement. the person in hell would not be suffering. granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever). you say hell (death) is eternal. however, this loses its meaning to a dead person. and to me, it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity. many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda ("friend, do you want the free gift of e-ternal life?" it's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. the difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival. >and it's a lot worse than heaven. that's the only comparison that matters. that would depend on what heaven is like. if god is a king, and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king, i might opt for hell. i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert eskimos to christianity in the book _the illusion of immortality_ by corliss lamont. the missionary started to speak about heaven. "are there seals in heaven? will we be able to go hunting?" asked an eskimo. the missionary said no. the group of eskimos then said something to the effect of, "well what good is your heaven if there's no hunting? scram." i highly recommend the above book (ioi) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no immortality). >alan terlep				 "incestuous vituperousness" >oakland university, rochester, mi			 >atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu				 --melissa eggertsen >rushing in where angels fear to tread.		 pax, dana

the parable of the prodigal son is not about who is and who isn't an immoral person. it is about grace and the love of god. most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. the elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. he thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. his father tells him that he is on the wrong track. he has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son. we are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. we are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.

dear netters: a new religious newsgroup "soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya" was pro- posed on oct 16, 1992. the discussion about this new proposed newsgroup went on in various related groups. the proposal, was supposed to enter a vote during the last week of november 92. due to a false call for votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be canceled. i quote here a statement from the moderator of new.announce.newgroups: "the current call for votes (cfv) for an ahmadiyya newsgroup is being canceled. a new call for votes will be issued within a few weeks, possibly with a new impartial vote taker. discus- sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called..." -- by lawrence, nov 20, 1992. a lot of confusion arose among the netter as to whom to vote. therefore it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all confusions are over. it has been over 4 months of that instant and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. a fresh rfd is hereby being issued. please! take part in the discussion under the same title heading and in "news.groups" or at least cross-post it to "news.groups". ****************************************************************

disagreement or dissent to beliefs, but will mainly be used to prevent derogatory/squalid use of dialect and irrelevant issues. the moderators have been decided through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponants by discussion in news.groups. the following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon: moderator: nabeel a. rana (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu) co-moderator: dr. tahir ijaz (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca) a brief description about ahmadiyya/islam: ========================================= the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi- sation, was founder in 1989 in qadian, india. the founder of this sect, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (islam, christianity, judiasm, hin- duism). he claimed to be the long awaited second comming of jesus christ (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised messiah. he claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a messenger from god have been fulfilled. the claims hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme oposition from many priestlike people of muslims, chris- tians, jews and hindus of that age. such opposition is often wit- nessed in the history of divine reformers. even today this sect is being persecuted specially in some of the muslim regimes. dispite the opposition and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. it has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background. the sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. its mission is to unite mankind into one universal broth- erhood and develop a better understanding of faith. ahmadi muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism. among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed by volunteer professional and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources. the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion. newsgroup creation: ================== when the call for votes is called, the discussion will officially end. voting will be held for about three weeks. if the group gets 2/3rd majority and 100 more "yes/create" votes than "no/don't create" votes; the group shall be created. any questions or comments may be included in the discussion or directly sent to:

in a previous article, dleonar@andy.bgsu.edu (pixie) says: > do the words "question authority" mean anything to you? > > i defy any theist to reply. well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes. you have to be very careful about what you mean by "question authority". taken literally, it is nonsense. that which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say "i question to word of this authority" is ridiculous. if it is open to question, it isn't an authority. on the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. the catch phrase here should be "authenticate authority." once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority. the difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. you can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. but the fact that i cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (nor does the fact that i can convince myself and other that i have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) i cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if i can independantly verify its teachings, i don't need an authority. i need an authority only when there is information i need which i cannot get for myself. thus, if i am to authenticate an authority, i must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings. in practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself. in spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. we select our authorities based on various criteria. (i am a catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the rc church seem the strongest.) without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do). the atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. this is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. if you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. thus the atheist position can never possibly change. it is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. to demand scintific or rational proof of god's existence, is to deny god's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything. -- ============================================================================== mark baker | "the task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts." -- c. s. lewis ==============================================================================

the story i related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our church as worthy of belief. it happened in la salle, france. the moral lesson of the story is: the lamb of god has been sacrificed and his blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as god perceives worthy of being done in heaven. mary weeps for the lamb and for the rest of her offsprings. this will continue while we disobey god or sin against him. mary, as a messenger, has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to god, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings. the children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, to obey god's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of the lamb. as she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the son of god in her womb, mary has been preparing us, the church, the body of christ, for his second coming (making sure we are protected from the dragon). also, she has been preparing the new eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient eve. the new eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by christ in his next coming. i relate the story again: i believe this and mary, in one of her apparitions in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these two children who tends goats and cows (i forgot the exact place). she was weeping and telling the children that she is afraid she's "going to lose her son's arm". she is mourning too for these townfolks because it was their fault that there would be drought in their harvest; not much good food again this year as it was last year. mary tells the children: * most of the townfolks in this place worked whole * * week even on sundays when they should be in church * * honoring god. these townfolks swears and * * uses her son's name in bad words. that is * why her son's arm is so heavy in pain. then she asked them if they pray. the children said "hardly". she asked them to pray every morning and night. when the children went back from work they had to tell somebody about this. when the news was spred and after thorough * investigation of the incident, the townfolks * * were converted and faith and obedience to god * * were restored in their community. * once again, the lamb succeeds. -marida "...spreading god's words through actions..." -mother teresa

"they don't want to" because of all this nonsense. by the way, for any non-catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church, but by those who are disobedient to the church in changing it on their own "authority." -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- steve creps, indiana university creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu
dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell, president of moody bible institute: > the other day, i was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing. > it caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing > evangelical christians, saying we believe in absolutes and think we > are the only ones who know what the absolutes are. > we affirm the absolutes of scripture, not because we are arrogant > moralists, but because we believe in god who is truth, who has revealed > his truth in his word, and therefore we hold as precious the strategic > importance of those absolutes." there has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of "arrogance" is aimed at. the arrogance being attacked is that we "think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are". in short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts. in particular, the problem is one of epistemology. as a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as "how do you know?" that question, it turns out, is a very troubling one. the problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head. unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question. and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do not have absolute certainty. let's take the specific example of biblical inerrancy, and a fictional inerrantist named zeke. (the following arguments applies to the idea of papal infallibility, too.) zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the bible, and history, and several other topics. he has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the bible is a source of absolute truth. he may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. his conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes. his conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible -- he may have made mistakes. his conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes. (noticing a common thread yet? 8-) everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking. no matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility. as long as any part of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered "absolutely certain". zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it. unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt. any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop. only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs. this is easy to demonstrate. let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: "how do you know?" imagine a hypothetical discussion: a: the bible is a source of absolute truth. b: how do you know? a: i studied history and the bible and religious writings and church teachings and came to this conclusion. b: how do you know you studied history correctly? a: well, i double-checked everything. b: how do you know you double-checked correctly? a: well, i compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed. b: just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is true. how do you know they studied it correctly? a: ... and, as you see, b will eventually get a to the point where he has to say "i can't prove that there are no mistakes" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be absolutely certain. there is no way out of the loop. this is where the "arrogance of christians" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake. claiming that you cannot have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant. * people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _the infallibility of the church_, by george salmon. he is attacking the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is knowably inerrant. darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu "at the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded." -- ludwig wittgenstein

according to what i have read on biblical idioms, speaking "in x's name" is a standard aramaic/hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call power of attorney. a person from jesus' culture authorized to conduct business "in john's name" had full authority over john's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for john's benefit and consonant with john's wishes. it was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with "in john's name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of "faith".) with this cultural background, praying "in jesus' name" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous "fiduciary" relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his kingdom. the message of "praying in jesus' name" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god's delegation of kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities. this idea of praying "in jesus' name" is not only present but prominent in the lord's prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent. the act of praying the words "in jesus' name" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of god's kingdom. for that reason, i'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning. prayers to god for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by christian or non-christian, whether b.c. or a.d. (that's b.c.e. or c.e. for you p.c. :-). i don't see anything in christ's words to contradict the idea that god deals with all prayers according to his omniscience and grace. van kelly vek@research.att.com the above opinions are my own, and not those of at&t.

the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting. does he grade on a curve, does he cheat? that is interesting. not to mention thought provoking. my own concept is that he is a father and we are his children. in that he loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with him. the bible says that he looks on the heart as the final measure. from that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. specifically, most christians would agree that there is only one heaven and one hell. from that perspective, it is heaven or hell. you either go to one or the other. the "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by god the father with intervention by jesus the son. not by others. for only god sees the heart. the bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." i would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure. in an uncertain and ever changing landscape he is always the same. yesterday, today and tomorrow. concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. were that the case i certainly wouldn't be going to heaven. the bible speaks very plainly about the love and care jesus had for and about children. the reality is that we are all children. some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. but the father, our father is always there. like most fathers he wants only the best for his own. there maybe decipline, but there is more love. it's sometimes looks like christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. those who do pass=heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. but it is really much more than that... there are few experts. most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way home. praying that we can bring others with us.

seanna@bnr.ca (seanna (s.m.) watson) asks: > what is the objection to celebration of easter? the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. easter (or eashtar or ishtar or ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility. therefore, your question to me is "what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?" when phrased that way i suspect (or at least i would hope) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to "celebrating" her would be. > it is celebration of the resurrection of jesus. no, you are thinking perhaps of "ressurection sunday" i think. (though i'm not too crazy about the word "sunday", but i certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.) for that matter, stay biblical and call it omar rasheet (the feast of first fruits). torah commands that this be observed on the day following the sabbath of passover week. (sunday by any other name in modern parlance.) why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured? why jump it all over the calendar the way easter does? why not just go with the sunday following passover the way the bible has it? why seek after unbiblical methods? > i don't recall a command in scripture for us to celebrate > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that > we are christians--how could we not celebrate it? so what does this question have to do with easter (the whore goddess)? i am all for celebrating the resurrection. just keep that whore out of the discussion. > if it is only the name which is a problem, i suggest that if > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of > words we are going to have to drop.

i just about closed this once before. i'm now doing so for real, after tonight's posting.
several recent posts have identified the english word 'easter' with the babylonian goddess 'ishtar'. 'easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with ishtar. if 'easter' and 'ishtar' were related, their history would show it. but in old english, easter was 'eostre', cognate with english 'east' and german 'ost'. the reconstructed proto-germanic form is 'austron'. not until after 1400 did 'easter' have a high front vowel like 'ishtar'. clearly, the two words have quite separate origins. there may be neo-pagans who worship ishtar at easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words. -- michael covington (ph.d., linguistics) -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <><

"whore" is a value judgement, not a descriptive term. [more deletions] overall, this argument is an illustration of the "etymological fallacy" (see j.p. louw: _semantics of nt greek_). that is the idea that the true meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form. in fact, our own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with how it is _used_, not where it came from. very few modern people would make any connection whatsoever between "easter" and "ishtar." if daniel seagard does, then for him it has that meaning. but that is a highly idiosyncratic "meaning," and not one that needs much refutation. revdak@netcom.com

i would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged couple become "married" in god's eyes? some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to god, and are unswervingly committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective qualifier) they are married/joined in god's sight. suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control. what do you think about this? post or e-mail me with general responses. if you need clarification as to what i am asking, please e-mail. thanks and god bless! ============================================ robert m. anderson iii randerso@acad1.sahs.uth.tmc.edu
i have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of christ's resurrection. first the scriptural quotations: this sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified, if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive. most of these quotations are of people who do beleive. people who would try to justify their own positions. second the logical proof: >quoted text... > >from: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (family magazine sysops) >subject: witness & proof of christ's resurrection >date: 11 apr 93 05:01:19 gmt > >[much deleted] > > 4. in nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been > produced to refute jesus' assertion that he > *would indeed* rise from the dead. > > 5. the probability of being able to perpetrate such > a hoax successfully upon the entire world for > nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative! > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >...end quoted text the period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered. in fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes. finally: there is no proof of the resurrection of christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the father's. it is a matter of faith, belief without logical proof. incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for rational western man, myself included. i hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection's occurance. i beleive, but i wanted to point out the weakness of logical proofs.

in response to a lot of email i've gotten, i need to clarify my position. i am not in favor of paganism. i am not in favor of the easter bunny or other non-christian aspects of easter as presently celebrated. (incidentally, easter eggs are not non-christian; they are a way of ending the lenten fast.) my point was to distinguish between (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but nowadays is not understood or intended as such. many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1). it would be illogical to claim that one is "really" worshipping a pagan deity without knowing it. worship is a matter of intention. one cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so. -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <><

[example of head-covering in church deleted] this was a good example. there may be an absolute truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth, which was having a lot of trouble with order. is it absolute truth to me? no. and i see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be. >evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.

first, i would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter at hand. all advice was taken to heart, if not directly used. my friend found out about the matter quite accidently. after reading some of my mail, i quit from the mail reader & went about my business. i must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages. he thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me. i got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop. he said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend. so we did. i neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point. now he knows where i'm coming from & now i know where he's coming from. and all that i can do is pray for him, as i've always done. i believe the reason that he & i "click" instead of "bash" heads is because i see christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo. to be quite blunt, i have more of a reason to reject god than he does just by the fact that i am an african-american female. christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society. the "kitchen of heaven" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today. i, too, have rejected an aspect of christianity----that of the estabished church. too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of "god's house" beginning with the images of a white jesus to that of the members: praise god on sunday & raise hell beginning monday. god-willing, i will find a church home where i can feel comfortable & at-home, but i don't see it happening anytime soon. sherlette
regarding the moral question jen (jenk@microsoft.com) asked: "is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?", i am reminded of a "speech" by one of the characters (i can't remember which) in the movie "parenthood". [i am way to liberal with my quotation marks tonight...] in this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point. he said something to the effect of: "you have to have a license to drive a car. you have to have a license to own a dog. you even have to have a license to fish. but, they'll anyone have a kid."

(2) it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge. the new testament does record that jews believed the body had been stolen. if there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did. -scott o.

(to make things more interesting, luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all. presumably they just stay dead. -- yes i'm aware that it's possible to understand this passage in a non-literal way.) 2 peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement. this isn't eternal punishement. matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. the fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels. rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well. they say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it. when talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death". this sounds more like extinction than eternal torment. is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans? 2 thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"? this is not necessarily eternal torment. this one can clearly be understood either way, but i think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity. 2 thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. revelation 21:6-8: see comment above revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes. even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever. it says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that there is no respite from it. but it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever. psalm 9:17: i don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue. --clh]

hi, i am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. i was raised as a unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently i have developed the firm conviction that the christian message is correct and i have accepted jesus into my life. i am happy, but i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and quite possibly about what christians should hold as true. this i am trying to rectify (by reading the bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the bible or other relevant aspects of the christian faith. one of my questions i would like to ask is - can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person? i have another question i would like to ask. i am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? i don't really know the difference between the various protestant denominations. thanks for reading my post. sincerely, steve hoskins [aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an introduction. these are books intended for use in undergraduate bible courses. they give historical background, discussion of literary styles, etc. and generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading. i typically recommend kee, froehlich and young's nt introduction. there are also some good one-volume commentaries. they often have background articles that are helpful. probably the best recommendation these days would be harper's bible commentary. (i think there may be a couple of books with this title. this is a fairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the society for biblical criticism.) if you are committed to inerrancy, you will probably prefer something more conservative. i don't read a lot of conservative books, but a commentary i looked at by donald guthrie looked rather good. he has a nt introduction, and he's also editor of eerdman's bible commentary. --clh]

| | this is a frequently asked question. every time it arises, it causes | months of debate. so let me see if i can answer you directly. | basically it's because the law was given to moses as part of a | specific covenanent with the jews. most of us aren't jews, so we | aren't part of that covenant. there was an argument early in | christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to | gentiles who became christians. you can see the account of this | debate in acts 15. the main question there was circumcision, but | keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well. the apostles | concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians, | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us. 1. the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai. rom 4:15 notes that "where no law is, there is no transgression." not only did sin exist before sinai (eden), but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai (ex 16). 2. the problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it. god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised "what ever he says to do we will do." that is why the new covenant is based on "better promises" (heb. 8:6). rather than do away with the law god promised to "put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts" (heb. 8:10). 3. including the sabbath in the acts 15 is selective inclusion. the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision. if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts 15. do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (gal 3:19). 4. israel stands for god's people of all time. that is why god *grafted* the gentiles in. roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of god and the promises belong to israelites. in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough "for they are not all israel, which are of israel" v 6. then in gal 3:19 he says "if ye be christ's, then are ye abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." all christians are abraham's seed, jews, israelites. not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually. we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites. | | while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us, | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews, | we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected | from the jews and the things he expects from us. after all, it's the | same god. however there are several ways of dealing with this. | | these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments | into "moral" and "ceremonial". ceremonial commandments apply only to | the jews. they are part of the specific mosaic covenant. these are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision. moral laws apply to | everyone. most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except | for the commandment about the sabbath. i believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law. thus christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship. people would probably agree but they are wrong. how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws? you are not free to choose your time of worship. even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship. would you rather give up a day which god blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see sabbath admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). | | a more radical approach (which is generally connected with john calvin | and the reformed tradition) says that the law as a whole is no longer | binding. instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior | should be guided solely by love. portions of the ot law are still | useful as guidance. but they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us. in practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce. while | we may no longer be under law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us. we're too good at | self-justification for that to be safe. thus christians do have moral | guidance, from things like jesus' teachings, paul's advice, etc. | these may not be precisely a law, but they serve much the same | function as, and have largely the same content as, the "moral law" in | the previous analysis. while calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that | given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important. | i do not care what calvin or any theologian says. my guide is what god says. if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment, which is the only one god thought was important enough to say *remember*? if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god. if a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do i walk out of the court saying "i can now go on speeding, for i am now under grace?" being under grace i now drive within the speed limit. paul adds to it in rom. 3:31 "di we then make void the law through faith? god forbid: yea, we establish the law." "wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (rom. 7:12). | in both analyses, the specific day is not an issue. as a matter of | tradition, we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ's | resurrection. there's some debate about what acts shows about early | christian worship. the most common analysis is that is shows jewish | christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath, but | that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then. | act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (sunday), and i cor 16:2 also | implies gatherings on that day. | | there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to | worship on the sabbath (saturday). the best-known are the seventh-day | adventists and jehovah's witnesses. they argue that act 20:7 is not a | regular worship service, but a special meeting to see paul off, and | that i cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service. do you prefer implication to fact? a careful study of the acts 20 shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to assos. in icor 16 there is no way you can equate "lay by him in store" with "go to a worship service." | | it's clear that this issue was a contested one in paul's time. see | rom 14:5. paul's advice is that we should be very careful about | judging each other on issues like this. one person sees a specific | day as mandated by god, while another does not. he who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the lord. he who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | lord. (those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue | that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here. note however col | 2:16, which says something similar but briefer. it explicitly | mentions sabbath.) wrong. these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the sabbath day of the moral law. | | there are some differences among christians about use of the word | "sabbath". originally the term referred to the 7th day, the jewish | day of worship. many christians now use it to refer to sunday, the | day of christian worship. they do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes) commandment to it. reformed tradition does not do this. it | distinguishes between the sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for jews, and the lord's day -- which is the free christian worship. | (the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev 1:10.) there | are also differences about laws regarding this day. many christians | support "blue laws", both in secular law and church law, setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship. the more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish | sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the | lord's day. | why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you. jesus died because the law could not be changed. why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law. penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable. that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws. it will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate god's name, to break the sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc. except it you disagree. but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god. darius [it's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq. i think paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said. i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord. i just wish he might equally accept that those who "esteem all days alike" are similarly doing their best to honor the lord. however i'd like to be clear that i do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day. as i indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited. the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else. they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings, but neither explicitly says "and they gathered every sunday for worship". we get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question. act 2:26 describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes. obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath. acts 13:44 is an example of christians participating in them. unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day christians met in their houses. acts 20:7, despite darius' confusion, is described by acts as occuring on sunday. (i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the biblical text is clear about what was meant.) the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting. it doesn't say they gathered to see paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, paul talked about his upcoming travel. but that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing. similarly with 1 cor 16:2. it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul's collection. now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, i can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. so i think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first day of every week" simply means every time they gather for worship. i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was. --clh]

on the question, "does god hear the prayers of sinners?" we need to distinguish. if we say that he never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago. but if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone who says, "lord, i want you to do this for me, but don't expect me to change my way of life," that is a different matter. even here, i would not venture to say that god never grants such petitions (just as he sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). however, if someone we know well is praying to god in that spirit, we might have the responsibility to say, "remember, if god's help is real, then so are his commands." yours, james kiefer
at the end of a recent (mon 19 apr 1993) post, alastair thomson offers the following "paraphrase" of john 3:16: "god loved the world so much, that he gave us his son, to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life." the "to die in our place" bothers me, since it inserts into the verse a doctrine not found in the original. moreover, i suspect that the poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic (or penal) substitution. i maintain that the scriptures in speaking of the atonement teach a doctrine of substitution, but not one of forensic substitution. those interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my essays on genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7 (with lead-in). the n'th essay can be obtained by sending to listserv@asuacad.bitnet or to listserv@asuvm.inre.asu.edu the message get gen0n ruff yours, james kiefer "any theologian worth his salt can put anything he wants to say in the form of a commentary on the book of genesis" -- walter kaufman.
a reply to a post by kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (aka nancy's sweetheart): ?human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted ?in very limited circumstances. i would beg to differ with you here. the properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually all the time. i am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain. does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy? your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the "mind" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual. ?at the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears. did he mean that literally or not? we do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words. was he thinking of ?tran- or con- substatiation? he didn't say. we interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions. but we know ?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong. (this ?is something that most of us have direct experience of. 8-) now you have hit on the purpose of the church. it is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation. without the church, christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects. ?unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of. to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain. this argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience. it reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure. now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method. ?darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?"if any substantial number of [ talk.religion.misc ] readers read some ? wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

(yes, my opinion.) i agree that there is truth in scripture. there are principles to be learned from it. claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems to imply a literal reading of the bible. if it were absolute truth (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be necessary. it may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person. to me, that doesn't mean that one person is right and the other is wrong. i believe that god transcends our simple minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent. god knows me, and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else's. by claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. i just don't believe that god is that rigid. > >evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > >to be absolute truth.

hello all. we are doing a bible study (at my college) on revelations. we have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation. we are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of babylon. i believe the beast is the antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents babylon which stands for rome or the roman catholic church. what are some views on this interpretation? is the falling babylon in chapter 18 the same babylon in as in chapter 17? the catholic church? hate to step on toes. thanks -------- jimmy buddenberg internet: jbuddenberg@vax.cns.muskingum.edu muskingum college [reading this imagery as the roman catholic church was certainly common in earlier protestant writers. a lot of us find that frankly embarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocate such a position. the problem is that the description makes it look a lot like a political entity. it's associated with kings, controls world commerce, is seated on seven mountains (17:9 -- recall that rome is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills). if it's a church, then it's not the current roman catholic church, but a church that has been taken over by the anti-christ and merged with the state, turning into something rather different than it is now. presumably in such a scenario the true catholics are among those who are persecuted. given the overall impression that satan is pretending to be an angel of light, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, i think the most consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-christ would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both the protestant and catholic traditions, but that the true spiritual descendants of both peter and the reformers are equally being persecuted. --clh]
as our local.religion.christian bbs group seems moribund, i'm posting here. on one of the sundays just before easter i went to church. the sermon was based on a story in the book of joshua. (the one about joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take) what i particularly remember, because of having heard part of a cbc radio documentary on bosnia, was that the rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were "melting in fear." what with having heard that cbc radio documentary and knowing that the muslims in bosnia were losing the war, i felt uncomfortable. after all, the serbs are driving non-christians out. on the other hand, ministers do say that the bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society. anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work. also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing christ to the nonreligious people of our area. the next sunday, the sermon was about joshua 6 (where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for rahab, who had sheltered the spies). with those reports about bosnia in my mind, i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in joshua) was right. but what really bothered me was that, if i was going to try taking christianity seriously, i shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" in bosnia. certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the moslims. considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who, under turkish rule, converted to islam could the serbs be doing god's work? [the example of god's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here. i personally question whether they were right even at the time. but those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by god. somehow i don't see the serbs behaving like a group that is led by god in this matter. --clh]

my brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. we've kept things on a painfully polite, christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (i mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). he seems, from what i've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. he has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. now, this is his choice, and i need to accept it even if i deplore it. but it's hard. from time to time i've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but i've always thought, "why be dramatic? and you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back." it's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best i could think of. now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. this was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. and she hung up. (i have never seem my mother lose her temper, and i think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with. i have mixed feelings. i'm proud of mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't "get away" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. and i'm frustrated because i don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. i try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but i am not free of the desire to *do* something concrete. (the desire to *do* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; i'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for god.) do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? is this a time to reach out to my brother? to let things be? how can i conquer my rage at him enough to be there for him? here's the big question i've been evading throughout this long, long post: is it ok, as a christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? to give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that i am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? do please answer--by e-mail or post. thank you. julie (jjmarvin@pucc.princeton.edu)

dear fellow netters, from time to time a term like 'oneness pentecostals' (or something similar) has occurred in posts to this group. i also know that there is a movement called something like 'jesus alone.' i believe in the trinity and have no plans to change that, but reently i was made aware that there is at least one person within our church who holds the view that there is no trinity. in the near future we will discuss this item, and i feel that i shall ask you, my friends on this group, for background information. can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there is only jesus? and vice versa: the foundations for the trinity? i shall appreciate both quotes from the bible and historical development. thank you all. in him, bjorn -- ______________________________________________________________________ s-mail: e-mail: | | | bjorn b. larsen bjorn.b.larsen@delab.sintef.no |__ |__ | sintef delab | \| \| n-7034 trondheim tel: +47-7-592682 / 592600 |__/|__/|_ norway fax: +47-7-591039 / 594302 ______________________________________________________________________

another issue of importance. was the crucification the will of god or a tragic mistake. i believe it was a tragic mistake. god's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man. jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth. he desperately wanted the jewish people to accept him as the messiah. if the crucification was the will of god how could jesus pray that this cup pass from him. was this out of weakness. never. many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. is jesus less than these. no he is not. he knew the crucification was not the will of god. god's will was that the jewish people accept jesus as the messiah and that the kingdom of heaven be established on the earth with jesus as it's head. (just like the jewish people expected). if this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today. it would be a very different world. and that is eactly what god wanted. men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living messiah while he was on the earth. jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with god. now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for christ's return. but when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth. isn't it about time for his return. it's been almost 2000 years. mike in article 28885@athos.rutgers.edu, oser@fermi.wustl.edu (scott oser) writes: in article <apr.10.05.33.59.1993.14428@athos.rutgers.edu> mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu (michael covington) writes: >the two historic facts that i think the most important are these: > >(1) if jesus didn't rise from the dead, then he must have done something >else equally impressive, in order to create the observed amount of impact. > >(2) nobody ever displayed the dead body of jesus, even though both the >jewish and the roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so >(it would have discredited the christians). and the two simplest refutations are these: (1) what impact? the only record of impact comes from the new testament. i have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded "impact" actually happened. i find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc. the earliest written claim we have of jesus' resurrection is from the pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event. (2) it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge. the new testament does record that jews believed the body had been stolen. if there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did. -scott o.
for src in most languages, the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch, or pasque, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the hebrew pesach, meaning "passover." in english, german, and a few related languages, however, it is known as easter, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term. one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an anglo-saxon goddess of spring called eastre. bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. but he lived 673-735, and augustine began preaching in kent in 597. the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. it seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an anglo-saxon goddess of spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by bede does not make it more so. assuming that bede was right, that would not justify saying that the christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it) has pagan roots. it would simply mean that the anglo-saxons, upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "spring festival." however, bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed. j knoblech, in "die sprach," zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft 5 (vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation: among latin-speaking christians, the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week), since the newly-baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. sometimes the week was referred to simply as "albae." translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." they accordingly rendered it as eostarum, which is old high german for "dawn." this gave rise to the form easter in english. yours, james kiefer [no, i'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating easter. however this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it. --clh]

rob butera asks about a book called the lost years of jesus, by elizabeth clare prophet. i do not know the book. however, miss prophet is the leader of a group (the church universal and triumphant) derived from the i am group founded by a mr. ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (i am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by marcus bach) after an eighteenth-century frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of "cosmic essence." a major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. typically, the ballard family and their successors, the prophet family (related by marriage, if i remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from tibet. i should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis. yours, james kiefer

according to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income. perhaps there are some offshoots of islam that impose this on their followers. but the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once a year. the same writer also objects to the bible for teaching that > "woman was created after man, to be his helper" etc. this is presumably a reference to genesis 2. suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. we have god creating woman, and then saying, "it is not good that woman should be alone. i will make a help meet for her." feminists would be outraged. the clear implication would be that god had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally his masterpiece, the male chauvinist pig. the statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. the fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. the verdict would have been unequivocal. "no self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!" i suggest that moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with adam first and then eve, so as to appease miriam and other radical feminists of the day. for some reason, however, it did not work. yours, james kiefer

hi... i'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance) i want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? there is this version of the bible i have read about and on the front page it says: "....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies." 					thanx in advance... shaz.... [i'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. the primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation. it's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning. there are a few differences in the underlying text. that's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand. slight differences resulted. there are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties. fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording. there are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, i don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases. as far as i know, no christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error. but i also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect. whether the bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here. many christians deny it. some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith). but this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions. the supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions. i'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though. what version are you talking about? i've been referring to major scholarly translations. these are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere. there have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted. this includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other. the copyright on the bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want. however the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks. i could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies. but if so, it's not any edition that's widely used. the widely used ones leave the text as is. (weeeeelllllll, almost as is. it's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies. because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, i'm afraid.) --clh]

(indeed i suspect james was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.) paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the greek. another key to why there is no conflict is to look at paul's statements in their context. i think you will find that when paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the law, meaning the law of moses. this was the great burden of paul's life. as the apostle to the gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the "judizers" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses (cf acts chapter 15). in this context paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the law, saying that we are saved by the blood of jesus and our faith in him. i believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*. i think "faithfulness" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended. >now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves >and not by god, according to romans that person is still saved by there faith. i think you misunderstand romans. what paul is really saying is that god prefers a faithful gentile who does not "keep kosher" to a kosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the lord and having charity toward his fellows. >but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to >him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm christian someone who >knows and believes in god but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible. in the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm. if you know god but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are worse off than the person who never heard of him. remember, jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the kingdom of god is *all* we have. [i agree with you in general, including the fact that "pistis" has some of the force of "faithful". however if you take that too far, you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have intended. being faithful means following god in all things. to say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins. i assume that's not what you meant. i have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this. however i think paul is describing what i'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment. jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change. we may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in christ in many situations where we should. but in any christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that jesus calls being born again. --clh]

[...i believe "jesus only" originally was in the context of baptism. these are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only jesus, rather than father, son, and holy spirit. this may have doctrinal implications, but as far as i know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father. i'm not the right one to describe this theology, and in fact i think there may be several, including what would classically be called monophysite or arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with trinitarian standards, but who won't use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not biblical. --clh] not biblical? what then can they make of the end of matthew? (28:18)and jesus came and said to them, "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded to you. and remember, i am with you always, to the end of the age." {other ancient authorities add *amen*} [nrsv] the notes give no sense that this is emended. do other texts contradict this regarding baptism? or is a misunderstanding of the trinity the most likely explanation after all? but maybe i simply misunderstand their views. (is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good bible and an unabridged dictionary?? christianity really is an education in itself.) -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |david r. tucker		kg2s		 drt@athena.mit.edu| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [arrgggghhhh. when i talked about people who rejected trinitarian language as unbiblical, i was speaking of trinitarian theology, things like "one essense and three persons". obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is biblical, as you point out. (i normally use the term "three-fold" in referring to mat. while it is certainly consistent with belief in the trinity, the trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th cent's. it's unlikely that mat. had in mind the fully-developed trinitarian doctrine. indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the trinity.) the disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of jesus. (there are a couple of other passages in acts as well.) this leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in mat. to baptize in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, and in acts to baptize in the name of jesus. "jesus only" groups baptize in the name of jesus. they consider this consistent with mat 28:18, because they say that jesus is the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. i'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means. i will simply say that it does not appear to be normal trinitarian theology. (it is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase "in the name of".) those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of jesus. i suspect that the most common explanation is to say that "in the name of" need not be a verbal formula. to say that you baptize in the name of jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under jesus' authority. in the 1st cent. context, it contrasts christian baptism with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism. of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages. that suggests that we could just as well say that mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the father, son, and holy spirit. one might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used. so long as we consider following jesus to be the same as following the father, son, and holy spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference. this does *not* mean that i think we should go back to using both formulae. baptism is one of the few things that almost all christian groups now recognize mutually, so i do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the gospel. this is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use "in the name of jesus" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine. but as i've said before, i'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is. --clh]

(song lyrics show your age :-) ) ? further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the usa and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of "evil" (i thess 5:22) so this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and god to be in convenant.

the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since i have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen. while it holds particular interest to the african-american community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it. as any knowledgable person should know, christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of african-americans. this was most effectively done by the display of white icons of jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners. it wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your god, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride. but how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons? pictures & statues of a black jesus have been found in european countries, as that of a black madonna. but what about biblical physical descriptions of jesus, his hair being compared to that of wool, his feet to that of brass? and think about the area of the world where all biblical actions took place. i welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply. sherlette p.s. i expect at least this type of response: "it doesn't matter what color his skin was; his actions & what he did for mankind are what counts." this is true; i am not questioning this. but he walked the earth for 3 decades as a human; this part of his existence intrigues me. and as for saying that "it doesn't matter..." to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for mental emancipation, believe me: it matters. [the general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified. there has been discussion of this issue in the past. we can't discuss everything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn't been discussed recently shouldn't be taken as a sign of general cowardice, arrogance or apathy. in past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a few scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely semitic. as you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people. thus you wouldn't be surprised to find african art showing him as black, and oriental art showing him as oriental. there are good reasons relating to christian devotion to think of him in such a way. it's also good now and then to have that image challenged, and to think of jesus as being a member of xxx, where xxx is the group you least respect. --clh]

	i've heard it said that the accounts we have of christs life and ministry in the gospels were actually written many years after the event.

to recapitulate a bit: - the essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other. - if two people claim to be married "in their hearts" but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state, that's prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there. - there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding: if you're stranded on a desert island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason (e.g., laws against interracial marriage). - the legal concept of "common-law marriage" is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record-keeping. - pastorally, i'm concerned that people should not use "being married in god's eyes" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding. one has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed. - but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married in god's eyes. right? -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <>< [i think the last statement is dangerous. i believe as long as someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage, they have a moral obligation, even if their intention was not right. other people are involved in the marriage covenant. if they believed in good faith that a marriage occurred, then i think there are obligations created to them. of course there are situations where intent can cause a marriage not to exist. the classic example is when it's done as part of a play. but these are exceptions, and should be clear to all parties. --clh]

this is an annual time of prayer organized by the focus on the family organization. if you have not heard about it on your christian radio station or at your local church, call them and they may be able to give you the information. many cities in the san francisco bay area have local coordinators organizing the time and the place to meet to pray. in san francisco, oakland, berkeley, san jose, people will be meeting at ~12:15pm at each city's city hall. last year, i attended at the mountain view city hall. it was a very quiet and meaningful time of prayer. |-------------------| | gary chin | | staff engineer | | sun microsystems | | mt. view, ca | | gchin@eng.sun.com | |-------------------|

ofm responds to a query about reference works: [aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an introduction. these are books intended for use in undergraduate bible courses. they give historical background, discussion of literary styles, etc. and generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading. i typically recommend kee, froehlich and young's nt introduction... two other intros to consider: the "introduction" by ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard nt text. the references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information. perrin and duling's intro is also very good. it's somewhat more modern than ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed. also the authors tend to go through the books of the nt in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the nt. ... there are also some good one-volume commentaries. ... probably the best recommendation these days would be harper's bible commentary. a slight dissent: i think the harper's is "ok" but not great. one particular problem i have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material. my feeling is that it is ok for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. i keep a copy in my office at work). ... (i think there may be a couple of books with this title... so far as i know there is the only one book with this exact title (james l mays, general editor, harper and row, 1988) although i think i recall a (older) series under the name "harper commentaries". also there's a separate harper's bible dictionary (most of my comments on the hc also apply to the hbd.) my favorite one-volume commentary is the "new jerome biblical commentary". the njbc is rather catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the nt. (the reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.) in any case the scholarship is by and large excellent. note: the njbc is a completely reworked, updated version of the "jerome biblical commentary", copies of which can still be found on sale. nichael

"logical proof" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life. if you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. but *proof*? a proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. you need axioms to talk about logical proof. you can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. i could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing. to talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. you can show evidences, not proofs. evidences of the resurrected jesus exist. proofs do not. i think christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved. i also think that this will not happen, as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go. it is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith. there are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind, too.

[with frank's permission, i have added some information here (and in one case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views. my comments are based primarily on william rusch's historical summary in "the trinitarian controversy", fortress. i'm going to save this as an faq. --clh] major views of the trinity [second century the writers of the 2nd cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions. justin martyr, aristides, athenagoras, tatian, and theophilus of antioch are known as the "apologists". their theology has often been described as "logos theology". based strongly on wording in john, they took more or less a two-phase approach. through eternity, the logos was with the father, as his mind or thought. this "immanent word" became "expressed" as god revealed himself in history, ultimately in jesus. thus jesus' full distinction from the father only became visible in history, though the logos had been present in god from eternity. rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead. irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists. however he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach. he still viewed god as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the "economy"). the distinctions are present in his essential nature. irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists. irenaeus' views should probably be called "economic trinitarianism", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments. third century --clh] dynamic monarchianism source: theodotus adherents: paul of samosota, artemon, socinus, modern unitarians perception of god's essence: the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus, but he was not god in the strict sense of the word. perception of god's subsistence: the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. the 'diversity' of god is apparent and not real, since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god, not to a hypostatic union. asignation of deity/eternality: father: unique originator of the universe. he is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end. son: a virtuous (but finite) man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way; christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. holy spirit: an impersonal attribute of the godhead. no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit. criticism(s): elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity. categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [in summary, this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all. god is an undifferentiated one. son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church. --clh] modalistic monarchianism source: praxeas adherents: noatus, sabellius, swedenborg, scleiermacher, united pentecostals (jesus only) perception of god's essence: the unity of god is ultra-simplex. he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person. this essence may be designated interchangeably as father, son, and holy spirit. they are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex god. the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself. perception of god's subsistence: the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god's modalistic manifesting of himself. the paradox of a subsisting "three in oneness" is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. asignation of deity/eternality: father: fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son: full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence. he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation). holy spirit: eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. criticism(s): depersonalizes the godhead. to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ's baptism. [rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy. there are actually two slightly different groups included: noetus and his followers, and sabellius. noetus was apparently more extreme. sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view. unfortunately, information about sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra. --clh] [i've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views. it originally appeared near the end. --clh] "economic" trinitarianism source: hippolytus, tertullian adherents: various "neo-economic" trinitarians perception of god's essence: the godhead is characterized by triunity: father, son, and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption. perception of god's subsistence: subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as "distinction" and "distribution" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. asignation of deity/eternality: the equal deity of father, son, and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the godhead. co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. criticism(s): is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity. [note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus, as mentioned above. as with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history. however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning. tertullian talks of the father, son, and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance. many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories. --clh] [origen, developing further an approach started by clement, attempted to apply neo-platonism to christian thought. he set many of the terms of the coming battle. in platonic fashion, he sees the son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings. the son is generated, but he is "eternally generated". that is, the relationship between father and son is eternal. it cannot be said that "there was once when he was not" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries). having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god. the father and son are described as separate "hypostases", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts. the union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios ("of the same substance"). the holy spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the father through the son. origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness. fourth century --clh] subordinationism [often called arianism --clh] source: arius major adherents: modern jehovah's witnesses, and several other lesser known cults perception of god's essence: the inherent oneness of god's nature is properly identifiable with the father only. the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. perception of god's subsistence: the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead. "threeness in oneness" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god. asignation of deity/eternality: father: the only one, unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning. son: a created being and therefore not eternal. though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence. holy spirit: a nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the father. he is viewed as an influence, an expression of god. deity is not ascribed to him. criticism(s): it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit. its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father, christ, and the holy spirit. this results in a totally confused soteriology. [note also that in most versions of this view, the son is not fully human either. he is supernatural and sinless. that distinguishes this view from adoptionism. --clh] orthodox trinitarianism source: athanasius adherents: basil, gregory of nyssa, gregory of nazianzus, augustine, thomas aquinas, luther, calvin, contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god's essence: god's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence. this essence of deity is held in common by father, son, and holy spirit. the three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. perception of god's subsistence: the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. as such, the godhead exists "undivided in divided persons." this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead. asignation of deity/eternality: in its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth father, son, and holy spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. criticism(s): the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of "three in oneness." [at least in the 4th cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail. nicea was originally held to respond to arius. arius can be thought of as carrying origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the son a separate entity. in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east. its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians: gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus, among others. while starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god. this allowed the council of constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia. --clh] adapted from _charts of christian theology and doctrine_, by h. wayne house. frank -- "if one wished to contend with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand." job 9:3

desiree bradley (desiree_bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the serbs as doing god's work in bosnia. i've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the ot than i would answer. but at this point i feel i have to say something. many things about this posting bother me. i know of not the slightest suggestion in the nt that christians should use force to propagate the gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of moslems violates the heart of the gospel. christ died to break down these distinctions. in him there is neither jew nor greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female. if moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them. furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. there are christians being attacked as well. one of the towns under attack is one of the few places where christians and moslems are living together peacefully. the precedents being suggested are from the ot. there are in fact two different things being alluded to. the first is from the entry into canaan. for that to be a parallel, we would need for god to have promised this land through a prophet. and we would need the war to be a holy war. there were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks. any violations were likely to cause the israelites to be defeated. rape would not have been tolerated. while the accounts in joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it. in contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. i see no evidence that god has granted bosnia to the serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war. the other ot parallel is from later, when israel was defeated by assyria and babylonia. the prophets saw this as a judgement on israel for her sins. someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the bosnians for their sins. this sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is god's judgement. yes, even bad things may be used by god for good. that includes actions of bad people. but that doesn't justify them. if you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking israel, the assyrians and babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of god. their intent was to attack god's people, and they would be judged for it. the fact that they were actually carrying out god's plan didn't excuse their action. furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from god. god explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets. as far as i know, he did not send any prophets to bosnia. while i find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, i am sure god will eventually make good come out of bad. but that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement. i am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the west and moslem-oriented nations. what we do not need is for moslems to conclude that christians think it's ok to kill moslems. the implications for the mid-east, and even relations with american moslems, could be quite serious.

(ephesians 2:8-9). yes, it is by god's grace and our faith that we are saved. we are not saved by what we do. however, 15 if ye love me, keep my commandments. (john 14:15). keeping christ's commandments is a "work" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him. also, 6 he spake also this parable; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, behold, these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 and he answering said unto him, lord, let it alone this year also, till i shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 and if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (luke 13:6-9). again, 16 ye have not chosen me, but i have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you. (john 15:16). it is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. what is that fruit. well, paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc. all of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out. if a person claims to believe in jesus christ, but does not do the things christ commanded, i dare say, that they really don't have any faith. asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important. good works should come out of and be a result of our faith. to have faith, true faith in christ requires you to do what he commands. the parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit. christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree. it is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it. actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it. i can sit and talk for days about the fact that i have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground. in other words, i can sit and tell you all day long that i have faith in my ability to fly. i really don't have that faith though unless i am willing to jump off the roof and take the test. words and talk mean nothing. i could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to i will, but this should be sufficient. hope it helped. jon ---------------- sig file broken.... please try later... ----------------

"the consciousness of christ." i have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh. it is my conclussion that as jesus, the 2nd member of the trinity, actually suffered as we do. he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do. he "grew in knowledge." he chose not to grasp his omniscience, but chose to be taught. it is my understanding that he was "led of the spirit" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god. but in jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise. that is, he was not aware that this event was to take place in time. he was living sequential history as you or i. maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not. >thanks again for the info. just so you know, some friends and i > are starting a freethinkers organization-- and i'm going to > use some of the info you provided for an organization intro- > duction... :-) i was once a member of that club. the "free thinker" is a glorious ideal. by contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive. i find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd. if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist, that is his right. but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his "rational doubt" when in fact he was led to it by his "faith". he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a "free thinker" to criticize the christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as a humanist. if there is no faith, there can be no dout. there is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith. pascal pointed out that "sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive. few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism." the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else! the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another. in fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term "a"-theist. some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism. in my campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember. however, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used. every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism. their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent. that is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary. next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out "look, your fly is undone!" each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism. to stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows. pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. the answer to this impasse lies in a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions. but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral. in other words, another myth. presuppositions my friend. it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions. even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions. presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence. > i tell you what-- if god condemns me for being honest, he is > unworthy of my worship. better to burn in hell than to > serve a tyrant in heaven.. of course that is hardly an original statement. milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia. it was even used in the first "highlander" movie. but again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of god. you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what he has revealed of himself through history, through his prophets, through his word, and lastly, but most of all, thru his son. if you are to reject god's annointed savior, then reject him from a correct understanding of himself. --rex

[as far as i know, christians (except specific jewish christian groups, and maybe some of the sabbatarians -- both of which are very small groups) do not practice circumcision on religious grounds. in some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons, but i've not heard it argued that it is being done because of the biblical commandment. --clh]

i've just read carol's response and i just had to get into this. i've got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say what they say. they are 2 peter 1:20-21, 2 timothy 3:16-17, and galatians 1:11-12. also, based on the fact that jesus is the word incarnate and he judges people if they follow him (see acts 17:29-31 and john 5:21-27) and that those who reject jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke (see john 12:47-50), then jesus' words are true and do not need interpretation, nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word if it had to be interpreted. joe fisher

julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described. my brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship). anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach. you would like to get out after the conclusion, i would imagine), and hash things out. more than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down). some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include: have each individual own their own statements (ie, i feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or i really don't understand where you're coming from.) reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, so you think that we did this because of...? well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....) don't accuse each other (it was your fault that ... happened!) find a common ground about something (lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.) guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame). however, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation without holding a smoldering grudge. the relationship really can work. it's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even. it's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions: you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise. breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive. joe fisher

(paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.) it is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but i don't think most people claim to know the details. i don't think i'd say it's the same atoms. i'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but i wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky. i'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever. but again, we have little in the way of details. --clh]

hey... i may be wrong, but wasn't jeff fenholt part of black sabbath? he's a major brother in christ now. he totally changed his life around, and he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the gospel for christ. i may be wrong about black sabbath, but i know he was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group... how great is th love the father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of god! and that is what we are!

d. andrew kille writes: >are you suggesting that god supports genocide? >perhaps the germans were "punishing" jews on god's behalf? > >any god who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of >my worship or faith. the bible does tell us that governments are ordained by god (romans 13). and furthermore, god foreknows everything that would happen. it is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of god's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil. however, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what god wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of his plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible. in short, the slaughter in bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of god (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of god killing people for their sins - onan in the old testmament for example, and annias and spahira in the new) is what he willed to happen so that his plan might be accomplished. but don't forget, it is not unbiblical for god to use one nation to execute his just judgement upon another. the romans were used to fulfill the chorus of "let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in jersualem. and chaldea was chastised by babylon, which got israel, which was inturn gotten by persia, etc. god does use nations to punish other nations, as the bible very clearly shows in the old testament. don't you remember the words of god recorded in daniel, "mene, mene, tekel, peres?" babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of god's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the persians as their due punishment for their rebellion. another exammple is the extirmination of the cannanites, ordered by god as the task of israel. the cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the great judge, carried out his just sentence accrodingly. i could go on with more examples, but i see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) it is not up to us to question why god has ordered the world as he has. in his divine wisdom, he made the world as was best in his eyes, and like paul says in romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter. 2) the message of jesus christ is as follows: "repent now, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." jesus christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me." there is not an infinite amount of time, rather christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow him and become fishers of men. he does not say, "well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fits in with your plans." he said "follow me." his message is not "i'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and divine judgement, that's only a fairy tale." "our great god and savior" jesus christ (titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous judge of the world. and it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy. d. andrew byler "does not he who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will he not judge men according to their works?" - proverbs 24.12

here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful ideas about how to choose a church: colossians 1:15-18 a. jesus is the head of the body, the church b. you cannot say "yes" to jesus, but "no" to the church ephesians 2:19-22 a. the church is the family of god b. the church is based on the word of god only cornerstone=christ foundation= apostles=new testament prophets=old testament (see revelation 21:9-14) 1 corinthians 12:12-13 a. baptism is when we become a member of the church as for the question of denominations: a. the bible teaches that there is only one church from ephesians 4:4-6, romans 12:4-5, 1 corinthians 12:12-13 b. 1 corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church. there should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings) c. there are so many churches today because of a problem. 2 timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle hebrews 10:24-25 a. do not miss church b. purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. involved on a relationship level in the church c. must come to all services another verse which is helpful is hebrews 3:12-15. the church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do. of course, more standards apply: 1 timothy 4:16 people in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the word entirely (ie, disciples). acts 17:10-12 the pastor does not come close to the apostle paul (natural conclusion since the apostle paul talked with jesus directly face to face), so if the bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take paul at his word but checked out what he said with scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor's statements. if they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've made a wonderful suggestion to the waco group, especially in light of matthew 24). joe fisher
i have a question for you all related to this. jesus condemns divorce several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this. the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with the statement that the marriage never really existed in god's eyes. (please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.) however, i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved. i ask you, is divorce justified in such a case? they knew who they were, what they were doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out. i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on. opinions? vera ******************************************************************************* i am your clock! | i bind unto myself today | vera noyes i am your religion! | the strong name of the	 | noye@midway.uchicago.edu i own you!	 | trinity....		 | no disclaimer -- what 	- lard	 |	- st. patrick's breastplate | is there to disclaim? ******************************************************************************* [this is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough that i'll allow it to be asked. as you might expect, there is a range of answers. catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified. (by the way, in situations where someone is being abused, or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions that i know. no one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger.) others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils. in some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage. that's because of jesus' statement in mark 10:11-12 and par. as with so many other things, this turns on your approach to the bible. conservative protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions. more liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results. (it is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim. thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions.) catholics, as is typical with catholic ethics, take a theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment. in the last discussion most of our non-catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce should not be necessary. --clh]
hi, i don't know much about bible. could you tell me the relations of christians with non-christians in bible? how should be the relations of christian nations with each other and the relations of christian nations with other nations who are not christians? the other question is about the concept of religion in bible. does the religion of god include and necessitate any law to be extracted from bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the government sides? if for example, any government or a nation is one of the wrongdoings according to bible, how should they be treated? is there any statement in bible saying that bible is a guide for every aspects of life? thank you. beytullah

this subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory. those who subscribe to _biblical archaeology review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a franklin mint ad. (_bar_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.) in this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. the letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that nefertiti was "a beautiful black queen." this set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an egyptologist titled "was cleopatra black?" (the answer to the title is "no"-- she was greek.) i have to say that i hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining. i personally have seen only one blond-haired jesus (in the national shrine in wash. dc), and i found it very jarring. western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the mediterranean. (also, if what i remember is correct, the "black madonna" doesn't represent a person with negroid features. it is black because of an accident. joe buehler....?) in the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair. when one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely. are turks white? how about persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent? was gandhi white? how about the arabs? or picture nassar and sadat standing side by side. and then there are the ethiopians.... those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are "white" (i.e., of the racist's "race"). if i may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race. considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, i don't think that this "jesus was white" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did. representations of jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine. it seems awfully self-serving to insist that jesus belongs to one's own racial group. -- c. wingate + "the peace of god, it is no peace, + but strife closed in the sod. mangoe@cs.umd.edu + yet, brothers, pray for but one thing: tove!mangoe + the marv'lous peace of god."

can a theist be truly objective? can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning? i've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about god and his scriptures. i've seen it in the christian, the jew, the muslim, and the other theists alike. all assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists, and with that belief search for their god. occasionally, the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion, but overall the majority keep to the belief that some "creator" was behind the universe's existence. i've known muslims who were once christians and vice versa, i've known christians who were once jewish and vice versa, and i've even known christians who become hindu. yet, throughout their transition from one faith to another, they've kept this belief in some form of higher "being." why? it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up. from the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the bible, the torah, the qur'an, & etc. he is told of this wondrous god who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophets talked about in the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc. he is also told that to question this (as children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against god, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture's truth is to damn one's soul to hell. thus, by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth" is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course. but it doesn't stop there. once the child is able to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the "right" readings of scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to explain away the unexplainable with "mystery." circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day. to doubt, of course, means wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns god. all of this has some considerable effect on the child, so that when he becomes an adult, the superstitions he's been taught are nearly impossible to remove. all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning god, hell, heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that god *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view? obviously, most theists can somewhat, especially when presented with "mythical gods" (homeric, roman, egyptian, & etc.). but can they put aside the assumption of god's existence and question it impartially? stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ * atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ * pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. * and all that jazz... -- [this is ad hominem attack of the most basic kind. none of their statements matter -- they believe the way they do because they were brought up that way. of course there are atheists who have become theists and theists who have become atheists. rather more of the latter, which is not surprising given the statistics. it's hard to see how one could possibly answer a posting of this sort, since any answer could immediately be assumed to be just part of the brainwashing. that is, how can anyone possibly show that they aren't biased? --clh]

	jesus was born a jew. we have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to david. it seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that jesus was semitic. 	as an interesting aside, jesus' being semitic makes him neither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on. 	finally, i would direct anyone interested in african involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the ethiopian eunuch in acts chapter 9 (i think it's chapter 9). this is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the ethiopians, was definitely african. because "ethiopia" at that time indicated a region just south of egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first african christian, but the first black christian as well. god bless, charles campbell

(btw, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the body). maybe i should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture. the extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized. the following is excerpted from my summary: 1. energizing - how a person is energized: extroversion (e)- preference for drawing energy from the outside world of people, activities or things. introversion (i)- preference for drawing energy from one's internal world of ideas, emotions, or impressions. hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the body of christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework. i'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all. jon noring -- charter member --->>> infj club. if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info. ============================================================================= | jon noring | noring@netcom.com | | | jkn international | ip : 192.100.81.100 | fred's gourmet chocolate | | 1312 carlton place | phone : (510) 294-8153 | chips - world's best! | | livermore, ca 94550 | v-mail: (510) 417-4101 | | ============================================================================= who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is.

(as usual, the current edition of the catholic encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.) i do know that the priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be required. however part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment. the community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible. thus marriage must be a public commitment. the presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage. where i'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases ("valid but irregular"). ne temere (1907) says that no marriage involving a catholic is valid without a priest (according to the oxford dictionary of the church), and they imply that the new canon law retains this, but i'd rather see a more recent and authoritative source. note that while a catholic priest is required for catholics, the catholic church does recognize marriage between baptized non-catholics as valid without a priest. --clh]
to what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have done so, so i will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic. in a previous article, eugene.bigelow@ebay.sun.com (geno) says: >>if i don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, >>then i don't have a belief. this is simply what belief means. > >unfortunatly, this seems to be how christians are taught to think when >it comes to their religion. this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. it is the fundamental premis "a is not not-a". if a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word "believe", however. the weak sense means i am not sure. "i believe tom went to the library." (but he could have gone to the track). the strong sense means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought.

(and, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.) >it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim >to know what god thinks/wants. it is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless they have told you. christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants. >especially when it's based upon your >interpretation of a book. most christians do not base their belief on the bible, but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit. the bible is simply the written core of that tradition. >the logic in the above statement is faulty >in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be >correct. if depends what you mean by differing. if i believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we may both be right. if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong. >it's all about perception. no two people are exactly alike. >no two people perceive everything in the same way. i believe that >there is one truth. call it god's truth, a universal truth, or call it >what you will. i don't believe god presents this truth. i think it is >just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, >meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. just because people may >perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the >other is right. thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it. you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken. in short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. qed. >as an example, take the question, "is the glass half >empty or half full"? you can have two different answers which are >contradictory and yet both are correct. so, for your belief to be >true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong. here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.) it is, of course, quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words. it is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. this does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct, but if y is equivalent to not-x then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other as in error. -- ============================================================================== mark baker | "the task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts." -- c. s. lewis ==============================================================================

(i don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! i don't mean to be too pedantic.) historically, i think i am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the west since napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although i'm ready to be corrected on that point!) this view obviously raises some questions: what about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. are those people also ``married''? if it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (i would say yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the west. although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most western countries, i believe that it is god- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.) -- ----- michael davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk) 	and hast thou slain the jabberwock? 	come to my arms, my beamish boy!

greetings, probably a tired old horse, but... maybe with a slightly different twist. i wanted to know if there are any good english-language texts for learning ancient hebrew, and how these compare with german educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea. i can't figure out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to the u.s. something i find interesting about studying theology in germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [i'm not a theology student, but i spend a lot of time with such folks] in their careers. they take the first two years or so to just do greek and latin and hebrew [possibly aramaic, too--who knows]. what's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the states? is there a lot of language instruction done? i really don't have a basis for comparison. regards, phil -- philip sells is anything too hard for the lord? k053730@hobbes.kzoo.edu --gen. 18:14 [for better of worse, we don't have the tradition of classical education in the u.s., so generally if a seminary believes students should know greek, they have to teach it. it's common for seminaries to require at least a semester each of hebrew and greek, though of course more is required for serious scholarship. --clh]

[remainder of message deleted] pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :) the reason we can say "god just exists" and can't say "the universe just exists" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular. that is, we observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced by a cause. the existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause. god, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect. as a supernatural being, god's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical, natural cosmos does. thus, those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal god, whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence. this is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but i just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (god) and the natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable. - mark

listowner: i have sent this to mr anderson privately. post it only if you think it of general interest. here is a copy of something i wrote for another list. you may find it relevant. a listmember asks: > what makes common-law marriages wrong? a common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. there is nothing in the bible (old or new testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (jewish or christian). and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings. there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. in fact, the traditional christian view (at least in the west) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness. however! the essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part. the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made. suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together. after a year or so, the man says to the woman: hey, honey, it was great while it lasted, but i think it's time to move on. she says: what are you talking about? he says: i am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger. she says: but you can't. we are married! he says: what are you talking about? we never got married. she says: i remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love. you said: "my love for you is as deep as the ocean, as eternal as the stars. as long as i live, i am yours, utterly and completely. when i lie on my deathbed, my last feeble breath will utter your name. my..." he says: oh that! that was just rhetoric. just poetry. when a man is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. you mustn't take them literally. and that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record. the church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa. the state insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom. prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't want their daughters seduced and abandoned. prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just "poetry." and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. this is the real thing. hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment. the church goes further and insists that, when christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a christian sense. the church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you intended. similarly, the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether "you are my main squeeze" and "i am here for the long haul" do in fact cover the same territory as "forsaking all others" and "till death do us part." this topic has come up on the list before. (is there any topic that hasn't?) one listmember was asking, "if a couple love each other and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of god?" eventually someone asked, "in that case, what is their status if they break up? is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on? " the original questioner said: "good grief, i never thought of that!" in fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, "we don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other," is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother. at this point someone may say, "none of this applies to me and my mate. we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part.' so in our case, no ceremony is needed." to this my reply would be: the reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road. what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. however, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are. back to the original question. we have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. he asks: at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? i answer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. if they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace? yours, james kiefer
i'm interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the following book in any scholarly christian journal, whether it be conservative or liberal, protestant or catholic. _the_lost_years_of_jesus_ (documentary evidence for jesus' 17 year journey to the east), by elizabeth clare prophet. supposedly this is a theory that was refuted in the past, and she has re-examined it. i thought this was just another novel book, but i saw it listed as a text for a class in religious studies here. also, the endorsements seem to come from some credible sources, so i'm wondering if scholars have reviewed it (or anyone on the net, for that matter). -- rob butera | ece grad student | "only sick music makes money today" rice university | houston, tx 77054 | - nietzsche, 1888

	a "new christian" wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it "by reading the bible, of course". i am not at all sure this is the best path to follow. 	while the bible is, for christians, the word of god, the revelation of god is jesus christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the church. i am not recommending any one denommination, but i do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the bible. 	this does not mean that the bible should not be read, although i would stick to the gospels, epistles, and psalms and avoid the book of revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. i am sure that mistakenly fervent projects to read the entire bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in chronicles. 	the point is that the bible is their to illustrate the faith of christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. vital beliefs of virtually all christians are simply not mentioned - the trinity, the duality of natures in christ, types of church organization. all these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the spirit. as such the bible, i think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading. 	following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, i would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. my own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading graham greene: _the power and the glory_ and the poetry of gerard manley hopkins. i would also recommend graham greene's _monsignor quixote_ and any novel by iris murdoch. the last is not even a christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, i often am more uplifted and god directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the bible. and that after all is what being a christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of jesus christ. paul halsall halsall@murray.fordham.edu

larry l. overacker writes, responding to simon: i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net. my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated. but that's really beside the point. what does the roman catholic church say? excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law. here's some of the theology involved for the interested. there is confusion over this issue of the sspx's "schism"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between: - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism take the various classifications of obedience first. there are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes: 1) a command 2) the response made to the command as far as the command goes, commands can be legitimate, such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays. or they can be illegitimate, such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around. as far as the response to a command goes, it can be to refuse to do what is commanded, or to comply. making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites: command response name ----------------------------------------------------- legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from. obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal. the nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are "obedient" or "disobedient". you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad. in my example, if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all! as far as the society of saint pius x goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires. but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them "disobedient". you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires. and there's the rub: sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church. the popes have of course disagreed. so where are we? are we in another arian heresy, complete with weak popes? or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers? well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the church is. the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are. the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth. you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country. (on the other hand, one italian catholic magazine i get -- 30 days -- has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius x.) many catholics will decide to side with the pope. there is some soundness in this, because the papacy is infallible, so eventually some pope *will* straighten all this out. but, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the popes may indeed be wrong, and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong. in fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him. at the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly. schism... let's move on to schism. what is it? schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command). all schismatics are disobedient. but it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics. the mere fact that the sspx priests don't comply with the holy father's desires doesn't make them schismatics. so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism? maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics. you must add this: the rejection of the right to command. look in any decent reference on catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command. here's what the catholic encyclopedia says, for example: ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors, denial of their divine right to command. (from the ce article "schism") is the society of saint pius x then schismatic? the answer is a clear no: they say that the pope is their boss. they pray for him every day. and that's all that matters as far as schism goes. what all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes. they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy, and the best interests of the church. (in fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.) now, what is the stance of rome on all this? well, if you read the holy father's motu proprio "ecclesia dei", you can find out. it's the definitive document on the subject. a motu proprio is a specifically papal act. it's not the product of a roman congregation, a letter that the pope has possibly never even read. it's from the pope himself. his boss is god... there's no one else to complain to. in this document, the holy father says, among other things: 1) the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted a schismatic act. 2) archbishop lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of tradtion. both are confusing: i fail to see the logic of the pope's points. as far as the episcopal consecrations go, i read an interesting article in a translation of the italian magazine "si si no no". it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction. if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law. but my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of holy orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction. it only confers the power of order: the ability to confect the sacraments. jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the pope). the society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone. they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop. the "si si no no" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-vatican ii idea of holy orders. according to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction. i lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more. i believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea. the pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. there's no way there is a schism, according to traditional catholic theology. so why does the pope think this? as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes, here's the passage in question: the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion. incomplete, because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition, which, as the second vatican council clearly taught, comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit. there is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on. this comes about in various ways. it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts. it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience. and it comes from the preaching of those who have received, along with their right of succession in the espiscopate, the sure charism of truth. but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops. it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom, in the person of the apostle peter, christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church. (papal motu proprio "ecclesia dei", 2 july 1988) it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following: - vatican council ii has happened. - i am the pope. the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. this is weak, to say the least! it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre's concerns in detail. what is john paul ii's stand on the social kingship of christ, as taught by gregory xvi, pius ix, leo xiii, pius xi and pius xii, for example? are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject? i don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out. -------------------------------------------------------------- [many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey "justified disobedience" or even "obeying god rather than man". calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean. similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church. if the pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists. it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed. but how can one deny that it does in fact exist? it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy. what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline? it's one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly. it's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination. that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate. generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope. while they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist. you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism. --clh]

(as well as by josh mcdowell, about whom i have no comment, having never read his work.) anyone who thinks that c. s. lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to the problem of pain, which is his theodicy. in it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. why? although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. he did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- "a great coward." ofm has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) i would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by lewis, i am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents. - phil - hey, we're talking about the phone company, here. the phone company doesn't have opinions on this kind of stuff. this is all me.
this is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine: the doctrine of god i. the persons of the godhead of all of the doctrines of scripture, this is the most important. the bible is pre-eminently a revelation of god. therefore, our first objective in studying the bible should be to know god. i believe that the bible teaches that there are three persons in the godhead (trinity): god, the father; god the son--the lord jesus christ; and god, the holy spirit. i believe that they are individual persons who are one in nature, meaning that they are identical in nature, each possessing the same divine attributes. they are also equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience. cf. matt.28:19, 2 cor.13:14; john 14:8,9,16,17. ii. the attributes, or characteristics, of the godhead. a. god's nature is revealed in the name he has taken for himself: jehovah. he is the living god, eternal, and unchanging. he is without beginning, and without ending. cf. isa.42:8. b. god is a spirit. cf. john 4:24. c. god is love. cf. 1 john 4:8,16. as such, he is gracious, merciful, good, faithful, patient, and full of lovingkindness. cf. psa 89:1,2; psa 103:8; nahum 1:7. d. but god is also holy and righteous. he is absolutely without sin in his nature, and so is incapable of sinning in though, word, or action. cf. ex. 15:11; isa. 6:3. e. god is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of his person), omniscient (all knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning, infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with unlimited power over all creation). god is infinite in his presence, wisdom, and power. it is my conviction that the work of the lord in our day has become very man-centered, and that the people in our churches know very little about god. i believe that the lord's work needs to be god-centered, and that the people of god need to understand that god is sovereign in all things: in the affairs of nations, in the lives of all people, and in the carrying out of his purposes regarding salvation. iii. the works of the godhead. a. in creation all three persons of the godhead were active in creating, and all three are active in sustaining creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs (for nations as well as individual people) to the end of time. cf. gen. 1:1,2; john 1:1-3; col. 1:16-17; heb. 1:3. b. in salvation in order to understand salvation i believe that it is absolutely necessary to begin with god, not with man. all three persons of the godhead have been, and are, active in salvation. 1. god, the father salvation originated with god. the members of the godhead determined in eternity past that there would be salvation, the conditions under which people could and would be saved, and even who would be saved. election to salvation is recognized in scripture as the work of god, the father. cf. eph 1:3-4; 2 thess 2:13-14. 2. christ, the son of god the lord jesus christ, through his birth by the virgin mary, came to the earth to accomplish two important works: a. he came as the final and complete revelation of god, the father. cf. col 1:15; heb 1:1-3. b. he came to provide salvation for all whom the father had chosen. he did this by his death on the cross, by his bodily resurrection, and by his present intercessory work in heaven. the work of salvation will be completed for us when the lord returns. cf. rom 5:8-10; 1 cor 15:3- 4; heb 7:25, 1 john 3:2. 3. the holy spirit as the author of scripture, the theme of which is christ and his redemptive work, the holy spirit is carrying out the redemptive plan of god in the following ways: a. he convicts of sin. cf. john 16:7-11 b. he regenerates (known in the bible as the new birth). cf. john 3:5-8. c. he indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification. cf. john 14-16-17. d. he seals every believer in christ, thus making salvation secure. cf. eph 1:13-14. e. he baptizes every believer into the body of christ. cf. cor. 12:13 f. he teaches every believer the truth of scripture. cf. john 14:26. g. he bestows spiritual gifts on the people of god for ministry. (cf. 1 cor 12 h. he restrains sin. cf gal 5:16-26. i. he empowers for living and for service. cf. acts 1:8 ---------------------------------- liane brown (internet) brownli@ohsu.edu portland oregon
>4. who exactly is "the lord"? "god" or jesus christ? john 1:1 says (nkjv - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day) "in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god." the word refers to jesus christ so from this john declares that god and jesus are one. therefore, "the lord" refers to both. also, david in the psalms refers to both god in heaven and the coming messiah as his lord. once again this refers to god and jesus. >5. what is the definition of a "truly religious" person? should he/she not swear/curse? does it say anything about this in the bible? some of the most "truly religious" people i've known have not been christians and some of the greatest christians i've known have been truly irreligious. however, to answer your question: the bible speaks of this in many places, a previous post to james is a good one. another is psalm 15: "lord, who may abide in your tabernacle? who may dwell in your holy hill? he who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart he who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; i whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honors those who fear the lord; he who swears to his own hurt and does not change; he who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take a bribe aginst the innocent. he who does these things shall never be moved." ------------------------------------------------------------ rob coffey "indeed the safest road to coffey@cptc1.neep.wisc.edu hell is the gradual one- the (if you send mail to cptc2 gentle slope, soft underfoot, i'll never read it) without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts." -- screwtape ------------------------------------------------------------ the day techwood meets the wrecking ball the world shall rejoice. but i'll have lost a former home.
i must have missed the postings about waco, david koresh, and the second coming. how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be it is obviously insane? i'm not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ. how could somebody who breaks his word be the second coming? koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast. he didn't. still it seems to me that he did fool some people. and, from my meagre knowledge of the bible, it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the messiah. so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the second coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be god. [mark 13:21 and then if any one says to you, 'look, here is the christ!' or 'look, there he is!' do not believe it. mark 13:22 false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. mark 13:23 but take heed; i have told you all things beforehand. mark 13:24 "but in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, mark 13:25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. mark 13:26 and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. my understanding of jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable. he's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible. by the way, from koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be christ. --clh]
pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup. i would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as i'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us. now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist. that would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which i guess it is, according to his faith). this is a great strain to our friendship. i would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because i call into question his bedrock beliefs; i am offended by what i feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the bible is god's word because he tells us in the bible that it is so.' so my question is, how can i convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship? how do i convince him that i am 'beyond saving' so he won't try? thanks for any advice. -- jim tomlinson 206-865-6578 \ "falling snow bogart project jdt@voodoo.ca.boeing.com \ excellent snow" boeing computer services ...uunet!bcstec!voodoo!jdt \ - anderson/gabriel
i'm concerned about a recent posting about wbt/sil. i thought they'd pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in ideological manipulation and cultural interference, including vietnam and south america. a commission from mexican academia denounced them in 1979 as " a covert political and ideological institution used by the u.s. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and repression." my concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even praiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian. it's important that christians don't immediately accept every "christian" organization as automatically above reproach. mp

in an earlier article, i explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines. that is, many christians insist that they cannot have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible. impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree. in short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect. so long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error. i summarised the problem by writing "there is no way out of the loop." someone called `rexlex' has claimed that there is a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase sartre, ramble about wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism. as i have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because you dislike them. `rexlex' wrote: > i disagree with dr nancy's sweetie's conclusion because if it is > taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair. however, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `rexlex' has written does not constitute a refutation. all he has said is that he does not like what i wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it. * there were two sentences in `rexlex's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand: > there is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be > experienced and it is verifiable. i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience. i have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers. i don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly -- but i do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers. however, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground. that was the point of the earlier article. human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances. > it is only because of god's own revelation that we can be absolute > about a thing. but how far does that get you? once god's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears. for example, let's suppose that our modern bible translations include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper, and that jesus said, exactly, "this is my body." we'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true. what can we be certain of? not much. at the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears. did he mean that literally or not? we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words. was he thinking of tran- or con- substatiation? he didn't say. we interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions. but we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong. (this is something that most of us have direct experience of. 8-) why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions? so, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that jesus said "this is my body." beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed, we get into trouble. unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of. to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain. that is the problem of seeming arrogant. the non-christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it. they do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do. when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim. witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up. i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only "very confident" of. for example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience. but other things, whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra-biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning. but, so far as i am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous. * `rexlex' suggested that people read _he is there and he is not silent_, by francis schaeffer. i didn't think very highly of it, but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians. somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it. if someone is interested in my opinion, i'd suggest _on certainty_, by ludwig wittgenstein. darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu "if any substantial number of [ talk.religion.misc ] readers read some wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear. (if they *understood* some wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))" -- michael l siemon
all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really sola scriptura. otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the church, and only the above chruches really recognize any power of the chruch to do so. andy byler [you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church establishing or changing a law. the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on christians. this argument is based on paul's letters, acts, and in a more general sense, jesus' teachings. further, most people argue that scripture shows worship occuring on sunday, and paul endorsing it. i understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time. the point i'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is scripture. accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to obeying the entire jewish law. acts 15 and paul's letters are quite clear on that. i think even the sda's accept it. the disagreement is on where the bible would have us place the line. by the way, protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by god. that's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc. if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide. --clh]
james sledd asks: 1. what is the nature of eternal life? 2. how can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it? 2a. if the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the best metaphor? c s lewis's essay the weight of glory deals with this question. i recommend it enthusiastically. you might also read the chapter on "heaven" in his book the problem of pain. he gives a fictional treatment in his book the great divorce. i have found all of these very helpful. you might also be helped by the treatment in dante's divine comedy. heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but i cannot imagine reading it other than from the beginning. i urge you to use the translation by dorothy l sayers, available from penguin paperbacks. yours, james kiefer
i appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query. one reply, which i have lost, suggested several parishes in new york that have good masses, one of which was corpus christi in downtown manhattan. by coincidence, last week's _america_, the national jesuit magazine, carried an interview with fr. myles bourke, corpus christi's pastor emeritus. fr. bourke also directed the nt translation in the new american bible. he noted "...certain practices have been introduced into the mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy." i note that at my parents' parish on easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen". this was not a kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 mass. i wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies. this newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, i think. benefits of the doubt are generally granted. it seems so...christian? john murray

(much thanks to jayne k who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!) i've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs. i'm female. yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i've been sexually harrassed at this company. seven times. eight years. yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an x-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer. i'm really upset by this. i suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something. there was no note. i do not know if it was: 	- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry 	- someone's sick idea of flirting 	- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!) i dreaded coming back to work today. what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, i don't know the answer so i take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep? i generally have a bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if i open it up to corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love association? i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff. i can lock up my desk, but i can't lock up every book i have in the office. i can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when i'm not looking so that i go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body. to make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch. the appointed hour for leaving was 11:30. i was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch. so i returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch. they left at 11:15 or so. no one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted. so, i came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor. this, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer. i need some prayers --- i can't stop crying. i am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous. i feel like i'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act. i feel like i'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying "we're leaving for mary's lunch a little early so that bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting..." please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive. please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...). please pray that i can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (this company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place? pretty words from the company do me no good when i'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.) and please pray that i don't turn into an automaton because of this. that's my bad habit: "ignore it and it will go away", "you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this", "you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way", "you are just an object", "you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?", "what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?" this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression. please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and god. in a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to god, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from god. (i know god doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think i'm falling and forget that god's still holding on to me.) although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide. for this reason i hope good mr. moderator allows me this latest indulgence. after all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics. thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers. peace to you, esther -- esther paris, raytheon equipment div., marlboro, ma esther@demand.ed.ray.com "in his esteem, nothing that was large enough to please, was too small for the fingers." -- john kitto, "the lost senses", 1848
in article <apr.20.03.03.06.1993.3836@geneva.rutgers.edu> shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (larry l. overacker) writes: you ask where we are. i would echo that question. i'm not trying to be contentious. but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? this is especially true, since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope. the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church. this is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church. if commands from *any* authority conflict with tradition, the commands must be disobeyed. my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way. god would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out. i don't view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated. run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the catholic church, and any impartial observer will be aghast. it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition, and also over authority and discipline. the problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith, in my opinion. most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops. it's basically the reformation part ii. there is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by the catholic hierarchy. i could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably. take the situation in campos, brazil, for example. i'm reading a book on what happened there after vatican council ii. the bishop, antonio de castro-mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of vatican ii. he kept the traditional mass, the same old catechisms, etc. he made sure the people knew their faith, the catholic theology of obedience, what modernism was, etc. he innoculated the people against what was coming. well, one day the order came from rome for his retirement. it came when the pope was sick. bishop de castro-mayer waited until the pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted, or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence. the pope confirmed the decision. so the good bishop retired. the injustice that followed was completely incredible. a new bishop was installed. he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castro-mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the new mass. the new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a new mass. the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse. the bishop was *enraged* by this. he usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church. the priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them. the old parishes had the new mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners. the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law. no priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional mass, because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius v. nor is there any obligation to say the new mass. during all this process, the people of campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop. nothing was ever done; no help ever arrived from rome. eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people. my question to the supporters of sspx is this: 	 is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms 	 could change and be conformed to those of the pope? (assuming that 	 the pope's position does not change and that the leaders of sspx 	 don't jointly make such choice.) if not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. if i adopt the view that "i'm not wrong, i can't be wrong, and there's no way i'll change my mind, you must change yours", that i've either left the catholic church or it has left me. if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy. that process is all very well understood in catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-catholic. the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the catholic world. if they knew the faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked! we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the "real" traditional teaching of the church is. if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over 900 years. this isn't the case in the catholic church. there is a massive body of traditional teaching. the popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant. there is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is. i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` i may be wrong here, i'm not roman catholic. :-) that's heresy, more or less. although they have done a great job since the reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful. infallibility rests in the pope, and in the church as a whole. in the short term, a pope, or large sections of the church can go astray. in fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the church go astray. (the pope historically has been much more reliable.) everything will always come back in the long run. what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation? would it be honored? if not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? again, i'm not trying to be contentions, i'm trying to understand. since i'm orthodox, i've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other. yes, it would be honored. infallibility is infallibility. but what is he going to define? that the new mass is a better expression of the catholic faith than the old? that sex education in the catholic schools is wonderful? that all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the popes prior to vatican ii? it does if the command was legitimate. sspx does not view the pope's commands as legitimate. why? this is a very slippery slope. not really; start studying the major catholic theologians of the last 300 years. everything is very well spelled out. the west excels at critical thought, remember? that's what catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries.

"darren" == dr nancy's sweetie <kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu> writes: darren> in an earlier article, i explained that what many people find darren> arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines. and darren> in short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect. the point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint. while reason is a gift from god, it is also infected by sin. yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, i think, does darren. we need reason, as darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend god's revelation of himself in the bible. but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word. we need, first and foremost, faith. for "the sinful mind is hostile to god. it does not submit to god's law, *nor can it do so*" (romans 8:7). luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation ("sola scriptura"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. yet luther also said, regarding baptism, "but mad reason rushes forth, and, because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless." (large catechism, fourth part, baptism). to make matters more complicated, luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an `absolutist'. i've seen him described as a `take no prisoners' theologian. we might conclude, given these observations, that luther was inconsistent or mad. and surely at least some have come to that conclusion. but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad. and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost. so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther (or others) as mad. rather, we should imitate the bereans, who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true (acts 17:11). the basis for the confidence with which luther, peter, paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the holy spirit. this is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason. the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly. god does not want us to preach the message that "i think that jesus might have risen from the dead" but rather "i know that my redeemer lives!" (job 19:25). the christian does not side with pilate in saying "what is truth?" but rather follows christ, who said, "in fact, for this reason i was born, and for this i came into the world, to testify to the truth. everyone on the side of truth listens to me" (john 18:37). we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth. jesus said, "if you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples. then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (john 8:31,32). the proverbs urge us "buy the truth, and do not sell it." (pr 23:23). the psalmist prayed "do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth" (ps 119:43). evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'. yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification. but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture, revealed by the spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture, as luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble. we should humbly trust in god's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness. rexlex> it is only because of god's own revelation that we can be rexlex> absolute about a thing. darren> but how far does that get you? once god's revelation stops, darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears. i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on scripture. however i think i would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably' :-) and less `academically' than you would. darren> for example, let's suppose that our modern bible translations darren> include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper, darren> and that jesus said, exactly, "this is my body." darren> we'll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren> absolutely true. what can we be certain of? not much. darren> at the moment he stops speaking, and people start darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears. did he mean darren> that literally or not? we do not have any record that he darren> elaborated on the words. was he thinking of tran- or con- darren> substantiation? he didn't say. darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement about the lord's supper. the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said, "this is my body," then that is what we should believe. other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture. recall that jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject. we also have paul's words in 1 corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the lord. in particular he said, "for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the lord's death until he comes." by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord's supper really is bread (as well as the lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us. does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false? i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it. but this thought is found nowhere in scripture. so we reject it. thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in scripture. [side remark] i've been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation. but it has been non-lutherans who have told me this. we tend not to use the word. i almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare catholic, lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord's supper. but almost every church wants to call their own teaching "real presence" because that was the traditional teaching of the church. [end side remark] darren> when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we darren> are infallible -- the non- christians around us rarely believe darren> that implicit claim. witnessing is hardly going to work when darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying darren> to cover them up. this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing. it is far better to take the approach, "i'd like to show you what scripture says. you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not." darren> `rexlex' suggested that people read _he is there and he is not darren> silent_, by francis schaeffer. i didn't think very highly of darren> it, but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren> evangelical christians. somebody else might like it, though, darren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it. darren> if someone is interested in my opinion, i'd suggest _on darren> certainty_, by ludwig wittgenstein. as long as we're trading references, i'd like to suggest dr. siegbert becker's paperback, "the foolishness of god: the place of reason in lutheran theology," published by northwestern publishing house. this book was based on becker's doctoral thesis at the university of chicago. david wagner			"not by might, nor by power, a confessional lutheran		 but by my spirit," 					says the lord almighty. 				zechariah 4:6.

jesus isn't god ? when jesus returns some people may miss him ? what version of the bible do you read mike ? jesus is god incarnate (in flesh) . jesus said, 'i and the father are one.' jesus was taken up to heaven after his 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. that's why jesus warned that many would come claiming to be him but that we would know when jesus actually returns. these are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-) -sheila patterson, cit cr-technical support cornell university ithaca, ny

here is another way of looking at it. when we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto. to visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this life. from that perspective, i posit that all will have direct knowledge of god, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought. that the experience of having lived a life far from god will be an eternal torment. that having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy. that the resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls. as an aside: if we were to be restricted for all time to our present form, would you opt for immortality? james sledd think in n dimensions & listen for the voice of god
hello, i'm back.. i would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be it a positive or negative one). i read every letter and thought about each one!! i got all sorts of responses, from "marry her" to "have nothing ever to do with her again" through reading the bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what i have decided to do. i sent her a letter today. first, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that "i would do anything to get you here in nc." i told her that i tried to find out if there were any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me. about her marraige comment (i'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause i still don't know if it was a total joke or not) i more or less said that "marry me?? well, get transferred to nc first and then we'll talk :) :)" hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way. needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...i have done a lot of reading about marraige from the bible. if she was dead serious about getting married---i wouldn't do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as i know to this point) a christian. it just wouldn't work w/o god in the marraige as well. i figure that if god wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 years now---he can handle one more. if god wants it to happen, it will happen! she will be in nc in june meetinf some relatives so i'll get to see her...and i'll get a letter from her befoe then so i know more of what to look forward to. i guess all i can do now is wait and pray. i have decided not to tell my folks until i'm totally sure what is going on. i do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers.. finally, i would like to thank everyone who wrote in... if you have anything else for me...i will be at this email address for one week. please tell me anyhting you want...i'm curious how folks think about what i did. thanx chris

heres a story of a saint that people might like to read. i got it from a the morning star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor. saint aloysius gonzaga the patron of youth the marquis gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the prince gonzage. he wanted him to become a famous, brave and honoured soldier. after all, he must carry on the great family name of gonzaga. of course, he was to become far more famous, brave and honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not in the manner expected. saint aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy from praying to god and meditating on the divine mysteries and the life of our lord. she had little time for the pleasures of this life. as saint aloysius	grew, he began to resemble his mother more than his father. saint aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's soldiers, but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he fainted from shock. this shows his immense hatred of sin (what an example for us of the contempt we must have for sin). about the time of his first holy communion (which he received from the archbishop of milan, charles borromeo, whom himself became a great saint), he con-secrated his purity to god and asked the blessed virgin to protect his innocence for life. he wanted to share our lord's suffering to	show his reciprocal love. he started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put pieces of wood in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of god. while he was in his early teens his father sent him (and his younger brother) to the court of the spanish king, phillip 11. obediently, he set out to make the best of it. he mixed in well with the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite, intelligent and always had something interesting to say. not long before this time, the great soldier-saint, saint	igna- tius of loyola, had founded the society of jesus (the jesuits) towards which saint aloysius 				 -12- began to have a yearning. when he finally told his father, the marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest. after a short time, his father sent him to the great cities in order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even through these trials, saint aloysius grew in his desire for the religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity. the marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted his son: "will you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish- ness?" "i will not, father," was the in-evitable reply.	"then leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!" with tears clouding his eyes, the saint left the room to	pray: "tell me lord, what am i to do? tell me! tell me!" he knelt down to flagellate himself as he had done several times before, but this time	he was seen. the onlooker rushed to the marquis. this at last brought the proud man to his senses. "the lord wants him, the lord can have him." he gave his consent for his son to become a jesuit. after some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a terri- ble epidemic broke out in rome. all the hospitals were full and could house no more, so the jesuits opened their own. saint aloy- sius did all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare the dying for a holy death. saint aloysius himself contracted the plague from	carrying and nursing the sick. for three months he lay with a burning fever and finally, on june 21st, 1591, he gave his soul	to the lord while gazing at a crucifix. let us invoke saint aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his humility, purity and confidence in prayer. saint aloysius gonzaga, pray for us. - brendan arthur prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service of others as a sword is to a soldier god bless from simon lines: 106 -- /----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\ | simon p. shields programmer viva cristo rey !! ----|---- | | monash university college gippsland ph:+61 51 226 357 .jhs. | | switchback rd. churchill. fax:+61 51 226 300 |\|/| |

there is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested in the pastor. i am still forming my opinion. i am solicing opinions, and references for what that is, how much, and how it should be used. as a general reference, i would not exclude responses from different denominations based on biblical teachings, but you have to understand our church is independent, protestant and likely to be much different from those that follow ecclesiastical authority in the church. we may need to discuss the roles of deacons and elders. thanks for your replies. | "answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him." | | "answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit." | | (proverbs 26:4&5)
i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist, but definitely do not believe in the christian god. the recent discussion about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus as to how a god might judge men. as a catholic, i was told that a jew, buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not believe this. even more see atheists and pagans (i assume i would be lumped into this category) to be hellbound. i know you believe only god can judge, and i do not ask you to, just for your opinions. thanks, -tim
my last article included this quote: "if any substantial number of [ talk.religion.misc ] readers read some wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear. (if they *understood* some wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))" -- michael l siemon someone called `boundary' wrote: > this quote seems a little arrogant, don't you think? there is a convention called a `smiley', which looks like this: :-) . it is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the preceding comment is supposed to be funny. and, i'll note that i have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- i'd say mr siemon was not too far off. 8^) * in the meat of his reply, mr boundary serves up an excellent example of what i meant by "there is no way out of the loop". i wrote that human brains "are infested with sin", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances. in reply, mr boundary wrote: > i would beg to differ with you here. the properly-formed conscience > can be trusted virtually all the time. which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed? the only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience. in other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted. assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, i'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning. unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain. therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'. (whatever that is supposed to mean.) mr boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem: > now you have hit on the purpose of the church. it is by necessity the > infallible interpreter of divine revelation. without the church, > christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects. the church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? how do you know? presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes? you write: > therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our > competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our > ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas > not subject to the experimental method. but there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'. i am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'. this discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line). saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident. when you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why. except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility. i have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning. all of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. the result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on. darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu [this particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism. i get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences. when i say that i think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, i will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes i used to reach this are fallible. thus at least in principle i could be wrong. but these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the bible that i think it's unlikely that i'm misinterpreting it. (in order to get this level of confidence, i've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues. i haven't, for example said that all non-christians will definitely end up in hell, and i haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.) i have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though i acknowledge that i'm fallible and so there's some chance i'm wrong. don't get me wrong -- i think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant christians, and often criticism of us is justified. but in at least some cases i think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. if the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- i'm just telling it the way i think it is. you may think god is immoral for setting things up that way. it's one of the critiques of christianity that i find it most difficult to respond to. but it's not arrogance for me to tell what i think is the truth. --clh]

>if i don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, >then i don't have a belief. this is simply what belief means. unfortunatly, this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don't accept their teachings then you won't be "saved". it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks/wants. especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book. the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be correct. it's all about perception. no two people are exactly alike. no two people perceive everything in the same way. i believe that there is one truth. call it god's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. i don't believe god presents this truth. i think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the other is right. as an example, take the question, "is the glass half empty or half full"? you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. so, for your belief to be true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong. [if a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that god will save only christians, it's hard to see how you can criticize them for arrogance for saying so. it could be that they're wrong. but i hardly see that it's arrogance. let's look at this a bit closer. suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught us things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity. if we believe them, and then add "and anybody who believes anything else is damned", then you could well criticize us for arrogance. but in this case the exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc. so we could be wrong in believing it, but i don't see how we can be called arrogant. maybe the world isn't a soft place. maybe certain choices actually do have eternal consequences. i can see calling the christian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in the same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it doesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a building). but not christians for passing it on, given that they believe it. the complaints i can see making are (1) that christians are wrong, or (2) that god is arrogant. --clh]

bob van cleef writes: if the papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the pope cannot "be wrong!" if, on the other hand, this is not a matter of faith, but a matter of church law, then we should still obey as the pope is the legal head of the church. in other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice but to obey. this is a primary problem in the church today. what you are saying is more or less heresy. you might call it "infallibilism". it's the idea that the pope is always right in everything he says or does. this is virtually all over the place, especially in this country. the pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions. when these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes. he can make *big* mistakes. a couple historical examples come to mind. bishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the english catholic church. at one point during his career, the reigning pope decided to install one of his nephews in an english see. bishop grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat popes with respect, even when they are wrong). the problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. this would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd. bishop grosseteste was quite right in what he did! another example is that of pope john xxii, a pope of the middle ages. he decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatific vision until the last judgement. he decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the church. though he didn't quite get around to defining it. now there's no way this is compatible with catholic doctrine. the pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the church. he went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even. in the end, he had to admit his mistake. shortly before he died, he recanted. his successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the church. if you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as st. robert bellarmine (a doctor of the church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fall into heresy or schism. the teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the catholic faith. a pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the catholic church. commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal *or* moral force.

(there may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) these senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. and, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. in this sense, belief in god becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind. >you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however, if >we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since >we can only use faith, why is one picture of "god" (e.g. hinduism) any less >valid than another (e.g. christianity)? > faith, as i have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. it is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. religious believers in general, and christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining gods revelations of himself to man. if you doubt that christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty. -- ============================================================================== mark baker | "the task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts." -- c. s. lewis ==============================================================================

my family has never been particularly religious - singing christmas carols is about the limit for them. thus i've never really believed in god and heaven, although i don't actually believe that they don't exist either - i'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people i guess. lately i've been thinking about it all a lot more, and i wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a god. i feel as though i want to believe, but i'm not used to believing things without proof - just as i can't believe that there definitely isn't a god, so i can't definitely believe that there is. i wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in god can be so strong. another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? how do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the christian god exists and the gods of other religions don't?? how do you feel about people who follow other religions?? how about atheists?? and people like me - agnostics i suppose. do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? isn't there contradiction between the religions?? how can your religion be more valid than any others?? do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were christian?? also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true christian how to behave?? i generally follow most of the christian ideas, which i suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. the only part i find hard is the actual belief in god. finally, what is god's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? if not, i find myself wondering why i so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion. sorry if i waffled on a bit - i was just writing ideas as they came into my head. i'm sure i probably repeated myself a bit too. thanks for the help, paul simmons [there's been enough discussion about evidence for christianity recently that you may prefer to respond to this via email rather than as a posting. --clh]

perhaps they were "strong in the faith?" --------------------------- [no, i don't believe that paul can overrule god. however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience. the law was regarded by jews at the time (and now) as binding on jews, but not on gentiles. there are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called noachic laws), but they are quite minimal. the issue that the church had to face after jesus' death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ. the decision not to impose the law on them didn't say that the law was abolished. it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to gentiles. thus there is no contradiction with mat 5. as far as i can tell, both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath. thus they continued to obey the law. the issue was (and is) with gentile christians, who are not covered by the law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it). jesus dealt mostly with jews. i think we can reasonably assume that mat 5 was directed to a jewish audience. he did interact with gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others). the terms used to describe the centurion (see luke 7) suggest that he was a "god-fearer", i.e. a gentile who followed god, but had not adopted the whole jewish law. he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person, and jesus accepted him as such. this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law. however there's more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law. in order to get a full picture of the role of the law, we have to come to grips with paul's apparent rejection of the law, and how that relates to jesus' commendation of the law. at least as i read paul, he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded. again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the law. in the middle of his discussion, paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say. rather, he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness. but ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by christ. paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading. but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law. it still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. for its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed. however for christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not law. while the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion. the quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount, where jesus shows us how he interprets the law. the "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not jesus' approach. jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremonial details. indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws. some scholars claim that mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish discussions. jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity. (mat 23:23-25) this, and the discussion later in mat 5, suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. paul's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the "ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the sabbath. he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards. the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded, and jesus talks about the law being maintained, i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law. paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision. as is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble: the law as specifically jewish ceremonies. he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct. on the other hand, when jesus commends the law, he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble. it's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the current context. imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in. paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term "law", any more than people who concerned about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family values. --clh]

******* ******* this is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ******* boy am i glad you decided to read this. i've got a problem that i need as many people's help from as possible. before i go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....anyway... ok, i am a 19 year old sophmore at ncsu. about 10 years ago, my family and i were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in erin. well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. by the way...erin lives in kansas and me in nc. ok, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to nc to see some of her family who are gonna be there. so i drove about 4 hours to see her. this is where it begins....i spent the whole day with erin....one of the best days of my life. even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman i ever met. (she's one year older than me btw). i mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to mention way out of my league...although i'm not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their christianity...you know the kind of people. but she knows i am a christian. well, you get the idea of what i think of her. if there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....i found it. that was last year...i kid you not when i say that i have thought about her every day since then. in out letters, erin and i always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but i know it can't be for her). she has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....now we are at the present... let me give you part of the letter i got from her last week.... "okay, now i'm going to try to explain my life to you. i'm not going to ku anymore because something just isn't right. college just wasn't clicking with me here. greek life is really big here and that just isn't my way. i wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. i was interested in something medical (physical therpy) & i love working with kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. and my parents could tell. "so i'm working full time at the bass store [bass shoes that is] and now i have a part-time job at a local daycare. i work in the infant room m-w-f. i've really enjoyed it so far. it spices up my week a little bit and it's great experience. "as of now, i'm not planning on going back to school in the very near future. the main reason being my indecision on what i want to study. but i definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. where? i have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be to kansas. "right noew i'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district manager. it looks like i'll train at the store i work at now for about 4-6 months as assistant manager and when that's done, i'll basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to chose where i would like to manage. i've pretty much decided on either one of the carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) wouldn't it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? what do you think abou that? i would like to know your opinion. "this job would pretty much be temporary. but it is very good pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. the company is solid and treats it employees very well. good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. i do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since i will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever i go. "chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. i respect your opinion. i've been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really good. i do like my job although i'm about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it is something. i don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female is too bad. "anyway, onto your career decisions. i'll solve your problem right now, marry me... "you can do your pilot thing-- i like to be by myself sometimes! seriously (or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the home life later." *********** ok, well i'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. what do you think she meant about the marraige thing?? i dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her letter!!! i don't know what to think?? since she wants to move to the carolina's should i search out a bass store near here and aske her to come to carolina??? i always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean??? i've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that i don't date beacause 1) no time 2) not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with the greeks whic as a christian i can't support-----and here she says she doesn't like the greek thing either!! maybe i'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that i am so attracted to paying some real attention to me. i mean, what if she did move to nc...what would i do??? i'm only 19 and she 20....i'm only a sophmore struggling through classes.. i have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, "god if she is the right one, let the situation open up.." could this be my sign??? i would do anything to get her to nc...here is some moree that makes it worse.. should i call her?? i'm terrible over the phone. i don't even like to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes. i mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me?? i'm really confused....i would really appreciate any help i can get. thanx chris [i have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with chris directly via email. --clh]

hi there netters, i have a question i would very much like to see some discussion on: is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war? what i would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: "all war is wrong", or "some war is justifiable". to get things started i would like to outline why i am asking the question. in my high school days i had been quite involved in the the new zealand cadet forces (this is a bit like rotc from what i understand of it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training). through this i became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. my favourite computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both past and present. i became a christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all military activity as immoral. for me, all war was in complete opposition to god's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies. during the war in iraq, i found myself with great excitement listening to the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation technology i so admire - the f117a 'stealh' bomber, the f14, f15 and f16 strike aircraft, etc. after the war concluded i began to really enjoy simulations based around this conflict - great to go and bomb saddam's bio-weapons plants in an f117a on my computer, or shoot down some of his mig's in an f16. the simulation of the death of people was a wonderful game. i imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way. one only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact of war is ignored: a building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a pilot is simply a 'target'. dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. these euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose support are necessary for the continued waging of war - one only has to look at vietnam to see how important public opinion is. now we see troops sponsored by the united nations entering somalia, and the prospect of military intervention in the muslim/croat/serb conflict in the former yugoslavia. my revulsion in particular to the siege of sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) sebrenitsa, has caused me to rethink where i stand on 'justifiable' war. i will list several wars in the last 50 years i can look at each, and say - yes this may have been justifible, this may not. these are simply my gut reactions to each - in many cases with the benefit of the impartiality history brings. let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for my reaction - i am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, i am working from popular history as it is known in new zealand. 1. the second world war 	- murder of jews - hitler had to be stopped. 	- massive civilian casualties on both sides 		- dresden, hiroshima/nagasaki 	- probably justifiable. 2. korean war 	- political expansionism by north korea, basically 	 communism vs. capitalism. 	- probably not justifiable. 3. vietnam 	- as above, worsened by us involvement. 4. vietnamese invasion of cambodia. 	- genocide by khmer rouge. 	- probably justifiable. 5. iraq (desert storm) 	- political expansionism, threat to world oil supply 	- other factors such as genocide. 	- not sure, but probably justifiable 6. a future involvement in bosnia 	- genocide - so called 'ethnic cleansing' 	- emotive - much tv coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties. 	- probably justifiable 7. possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic, somewhere in the world by the us in response to someone else - e.g. libya or israel. 	- my feelings in this are simple 	- nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent 	- i love the new zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear 	 armed or powered warships from nz port. 	- never justifiable. these are my own views, i have looked at scripture, and i am confused. i would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. i *don't* want a - naaahh, yer wrong - i think answers 8-). thanks for your help. ========================================================================== | alastair thomson, | phone +64-3-479-8347 chief programmer, | fax +64-3-479-8529 the black albatross porject, | university of otago, | department of computer science, | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz p.o. box 56 | athomson@otago.ac.nz dunedin | nextmail welcome new zealand | "god loved the world so much, that he gave us his son, to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life" john 3:16, paraphrase ==========================================================================
i used to be a marriage commissioner for the alaska court system (sort of a justice of the peace). i had great difficulty with that duty. i used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is god's institution, not the state's. gradually, however, i came to conclude that because i was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, i was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if i had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). i thought i had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before god, and "marriage" before the state, until i had to deal with my own divorce. keeping matthew 19:6 in mind, i felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before god, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless. i would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: if intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved? karl thoennes iii university of alaska
romans 8:28 (rsv) we know that in everything god works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. murphy's law: if anything can go wrong, it will. we are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on murphy's law. but how do we harmonize that with romans 8:28? for that matter, how appropriate is humor contradicted by scripture? -- --- tim rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu

i've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by michael covington, i think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology. i've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. i grew up in a home where christ was a bad word. people who were very angry said it. the word christian meant someone who was not a jew. it carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy. it took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `christ' and `christian'. when i accepted jesus, i expected to be disowned. to become a christian meant to join the enemy. i knew others would consider me a traitor. at some level, i agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price. like esau, i sold my birthright. however, i made a better bargain. he only got some stew, but i got the incomparable riches of knowing christ. as it turned out, my parents did not disown me. i found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that i would grow out of. by the time they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it. they didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either. for example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church. when i visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, "as far as i'm concerned, you still are a jew." what she meant was that she loved me and forgave me. but i am not a jew. i am a christian. (i'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-)) i do not keep kosher. i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday. my sons are not circumcised. but these things are true of some people who do consider themselves jews. it is not these rules that make people jews; it is the heritage from the past. i gave up the past. this is why i find it hard to relate to messianic jews. their experience is unlike mine. they still consider themselves jews while following jesus. some would even say that i *must* do so, too. i am at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage. it was not something i valued very much when i gave it. but i did have a sense that i was giving it for god. it may have been a small sacrifice. it may have been an unnecessary sacrifice. but i gave it and do not want to ask for it back. and while i don't have the heritage i was born with, i do have another. i am an outcast from the house of israel, but i am a member of the church. one of the things i like about being a catholic christian is that it is rich in tradition. it gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past. this is probably one of the reasons why i don't like it when people mess around with christian traditions (for example, changing the name of easter). these traditions fill an important emotional need of mine. i suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all believers of jewish background are the same. for some `jewish christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. jayne kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org

(please, no flames or advice on how to convert him!) one of my good friends is hindi and i greatly respect her beliefs and the culture surrounding her religion. my best friend is jewish and i have always held a profound resepct for the jewish religion (chaim potok and isaac bashevis singer are two of my favorite authors). i really do not think you can make that kind of generalization about how christians choose -- and i do mean choose-- their faith. if they have not consciously accepted the faith in their adult lives (which is what confirmation represents), then you can talk about their being brainwashed. vera "if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice!" 	- rush, "freewill"

here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular. he wrote it around 1990. the first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland (in this country), but i cut all that. and i pared down the rest to what was relevant. joe buehler ... schism and disobedience according to st. thomas aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him. on first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. however, standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. if this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures. the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique. the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre. he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church, for example, luther's rejection of the papacy. father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience. the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend "to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies." it adds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."not only does mgr. lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome. the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july/august 1989 issue of 30 days: "we pray for the pope every day. nothing has changed with the consecrations last june 30. we are not sedevacantists. we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church. we don't even say that he is a heretical pope. we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy." ... intrinsically schismatic? the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr. lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. a bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. this is not true. if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. in the 1917 code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension (see canon 2370 of the 1917 code). pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china. the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr. lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the church, and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr. lefebvre. the consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff. but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response. it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression. there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. the new code of canon law includes a section beginning with canon 1364 entitled "penalties for specific offenses" (de poenis in singula dicta). the first part deals with "offenses against religion and the unity of the church" (de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem). canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church. but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of "penalties for specific offenses" which is entitled "usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise" (de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis). the canon in question is canon 1382, which reads: "a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the holy see." the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder. i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law. canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr. lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. father patrick yaldrini, dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the 4 july 1988 issue of valeurs actuelles that, as i have just explained, mgr. lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel church. cardinal rosalio lara, president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 july 1988 issue of la repubblica. it would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion. the cardinal wrote: the act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not in itself a schismatic act. in fact, the code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections. one deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church, and these are apostasy, schism, and heresy. consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry. for example, in the case of the consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the church. .... it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. he is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy, and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society. canon law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as canon law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. furthermore, while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls. dr. eric m. de saventhem, president of the international una voce association, is one of the best informed laymen in the church, and he knows the archbishop intimately. dr. de saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr. lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop's lifetime. a quotation from a statement by dr. de saventhem which was published in the 15 february 1989 remnant merits careful study: in retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 june appears more paved with grave roman (and, unfortunately, also papal) omissions than with lefebvrist "obstinancies." and from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense against the faith! it is said--today--that mgr. lefebvre has "an erroneous concept of tradition." if this were so, cardinal ratzinger could not, on behalf of the pope, have addressed to the archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 july 1987: "your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procuring for it 'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to the faith of all time... the holy father understands your concern and shares it."

(someone insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here ;-) ) a being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. a being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway. let us return to the original question: why? a being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. this being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). the question "why anything exists" can be countered by demanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence". actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. tautology at its best. i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question. some christians i have talked to have said that actually, god is himself the existence. however, i see several problems with this answer. first, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. this is pantheism, not christianity. another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence. this sounds much better, but i am tempted to ask: does god himself exist, then? if god is the source of his own existence, it can only mean that he has, in terms of human time, always existed. but this is not the same as the source of all existence. this argument sounds like god does not exist, but meta-exists, and from his meta-existent perspective, he created existence. i think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words. the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. being an atheist myself, i do not accept such answers, since i do not have any other methods. the second question: how did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and i, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent hawking biography; see also lizhi & shuxian: creation of the universe, world scientific, 1989). however, i think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this. : as far as i can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why". that isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us "how", not why, something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the "why" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. : i believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, : reproducing life, *ever*.

hello, i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup, and i think that they can be used to explain each other. unfortunately i don't have direct quotes handy... 1) atheists believe that when they die, they die forever. 2) a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair. i don't see what the problem is! to christians, hell is, by definition, eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die. there's no reason hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough. literal interpreters of the bible will have a problem with this view, since the bible talks about the fires of hell and such. personally, i don't think that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--i treat both these statements as metaphorical. alan terlep				 "...and the scorpion says, 'it's oakland university, rochester, mi		in my nature.'" atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu	 rushing in where angels fear to tread.				--jody

the sophomore (romans 1:22) the sophomore says, ``what is truth?'' and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers. how modern how daring how liberating how modern how daring how liberating they chant the sophomore, being american doesn't know that his ``question'' modern skeptical cynical was asked before, by a modern skeptical cynical urbane cosmopolitan politician (appointed not elected) who happened to live two thousand years ago. like many politicians he cared less about ideals than results less about ends than means less about anything than keeping his job (and his head). we might call him a bit brutal though `firm' would be kinder (and no doubt stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) he didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (nor feared worse, except regarding his head). and when these wily jews with their heads-i-win, tails-you-lose conundrums brought forth their madman, his first impulse was to play the roman: ``i find nothing wrong with him, see to it yourselves.'' but when they mentioned `king' and `caesar' his heart froze. if he killed their madman he'd start a riot and lose his job (and his head) if he saved the king of the jews he'd piss off caesar and lose his job (and his head) and when his wife told him to have nothing to do with the righteous lout she didn't tell him anything he hadn't already figured out. so he punted. ``not my jurisdiction! take him to see herod!'' (who just happened to be in town....) herod appreciated the courtesy but wasn't worried and sent the sharp-tongued fool (who suddenly didn't have much to say, funny how people lose it under pressure....) back in the attire proper to his royal state. his ass is covered---if herod has no problem, caesar certainly won't. the fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not caesar's. ``i'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (looks like he'll last this one out....) the crowd's reaction puzzled him. they really wanted him dead. they didn't want the king of the jews, they wanted barabbas instead (and, as josephus records, they got him) oh well, he thought, they all look the same to me. and we'll get barabbas next time. and if i can get them to say ``we have no king but caesar!'' by killing a madman, hell, i'll kill ten a day. and then pilate had his fun a little joke short to the point trilingual and all this went as it always does when someone gets caught in the gears of government and there's a scientific explanation (no doubt) for the superstitious rumors (persisting to this day) that it didn't all end with a tomb and a roman squadron on guard. our sophomore doesn't know about this he doesn't recognize his kindred spirit (or truth either, as he admits). i guess we haven't learned much in two thousand years. -- -fred gilham gilham@csl.sri.com "peace is only better than war when it's not hell too. war being hell makes sense." -walker percy, the second coming
i dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned, and the trumpet had blown. i dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne. oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. they cried for the rock and the mountains. they prayed, but their prayers were too late. the soul that had put off salvation, "not tonight i'll get saved by and by. no time now to think of ....... religion," alas, he had found time to die. and i saw a great white throne. now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet jesus thought it was. paul thought it was. paul said, "knowing therefore, the terror of the lord, we persuade men." today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship. we don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell. as jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat. yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell. a place so fearful that god died to save us from having to experience it. whatever you or i, as christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to "outer darkness.". jesus, in mt. 25, tells us that he didn't prepare hell for people. he prepared it for the devil and his angels. no where in the bible do i read -anywhere, that god predestined anybody to go to hell. d.l. moody use to say that the elect are the "whosoever will" and the nonelect are the "whosoever wont's." whether or not that's theologically sound, i couldn't defend, but its practical. jesus said to the people of israel, "ye would not." now, some of you may not be students of the bible, heck -some of you may not be christians. have you ever said to somebody, "i don't believe in hell. i believe in the religion of jesus." but did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven! "oh i believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount." you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on the mount. you'll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. several times he talks about hell and about judgment. in fact, over and over in the synoptics, matthew, mark and luke, jesus talks about hell. not isaiah. not moses. not john the baptist, though he did, but jesus, the son of god. the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and didn't want to see them go there. now, if there is no hell then jesus preached in vain. it was our lord jesus, not some angry baptist preacher, that said, "where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out." jesus said that. it was jesus who called hell a "furnace of fire." it was jesus that used the word, "condemnation." "and this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. jesus said that. how can we get it across to you that a loving, dying jesus preached about hell? not only that, but he went through hell. that's what calgary was all about. when my lord was on the cross, darkness fell. he called hell, "outer darkness." do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there? that's not what hell is. hell's not a party. there's no fellowship there. he called it "outer darkness." "outer" -away from god. "darkness" -god is light. no when he was on the cross, he was made sin for you and for me. god treated jesus the way sinners have to be treated. that's is a sobering thought. as my son would say, an "awesome" thought. "my god, my god why hast thou forsaken me?" hell is isolation. there's no fellowship in hell. there's no friendship in hell. there's no loving embrace in hell. there's no hand shake in hell. there's no word of encouragement in hell. "i thirst." it goes much deeper than physical thirst. hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction. the man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally. the man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied. one theologian has put it this way and i think it deserves merit. what is hell? hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost. in a recent post, i was trying to remember the founder of the word of life ministries. i've remembered his name, jack wertzen, and found that the illustration that i gave wasn't his. his illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to jack. "they sing these songs and read bible verses, and their praising this and that -i can't stand it! jack, do you think god would send me to hell?" jack answered by saying, "yes i think he would!" of course the barber said, "what do you mean by that." "well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to god now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity? you'd be miserable. because god loves you, he'd put you where it would match what you really are." it makes a man think. the crucifixion of jesus christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act. don't ask me how, i don't know. but he is god and he is the infinite/eternal and when he died, he died an infinite/eternal death. it is by that eternal act that he purchased eternal life for the "whosoever wills." he suffered eternal judgment. a lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying "everybody is going to be saved eventually." -universalism. my bible says no, he'll separate them. the sheep from the goats. ".after you die there's a probationary period in which god prepares you for heaven." no, my bible says that "it is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment." some of the cultist believe in annihilation. after you die, sssswish. just like a mosquito you're squished out. no, in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven. i don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire word of god. -there is a place called hell. if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, i'd give it to you, but i haven't found it. that fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our god is a god of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that he has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that he has placed us in a "uni"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications. 1) as i've already mentioned. if you are a christian, you must worn others. its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out. "knowing therefore the terror of lord, we persuade men." 2) if you haven't accepted jesus are your savior, you're taking an awful chance. as i say to the jehovah witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and i am wrong, then i will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if i am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation. i don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like dirty harry said, "you've got to ask yourself, 'do i feel lucky?' well do you?" "a man's got to know his limitations." don't be one of the "whosoever wont's." "because while i was yet a sinner, he died for me." "there's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another." --rex
i find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed. then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder. he has established a two-tiered god. one set of rules for the jews (his people) and another set for the saved gentiles (his people). why would god discriminate? does the jew who accepts jesus now have to live under the gentile rules. god has one set of rules for all his people. paul was never against the law. in fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law. paul's point is germane to both jews and greeks. the law can never be used as an instrument of salvation. and please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one. in matt 5:14-19 christ plainly says what he came to do and you say he was only saying that for the jews's benefit. your christ must be a politician, speaking from both sides of his mouth. as paul said, "i have not so learned christ." forget all the theology, just do what jesus says. your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth, far less in god's judgement hall. darius

(nd alone would fill both those catagories) his answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was. i saw this time and time again at different open forums. so yes, schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic. it certainly isn't grad level reading. but we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading. do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein? i may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time. also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness. one cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base. look, the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality. but we must add a qualification to give this balance. christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place. we never know the value of a thing until we know its limits. put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value! this is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic. it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not christian faith, which leads to irrationality. if we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life: "more without limits is less; less with limits is more." or as i have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom. let's put it another way. the rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. think about that. it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it. christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else. when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding. this is where the principle of suspended judgment applies. at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god, it must suspend judgment and say, "father i do not understand you but i trust you." now don't read all your objections of me into that statement. i wasn't saying i do not understand you at all, but i trust you anyway." it means that "i do not understand you *in this situation* but i do understand *why i trust you* anyway" therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not. the former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity. the latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of faith. so.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational. it is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith. as believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all the difference. now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where i have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice. in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent "whying" of a 3 year old. it isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know. the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish. more specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith. if we do not know why we trust god, then we will always need to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him. failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust. if, on the other hand, we do know why we trust god, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing. (too many xian leaders teach as if the christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall) for what god is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory! it may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. and that my friend, was the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and in practice. --rex

[in looking through my files this weekend, i ran across some lyrics from various rock groups that have content. here are two from black sabbath's "master of reality". i'll say this much for the music of the '60's and early '70's, at least they asked questions of significance. jethro tull is another to asked and wrote about things that caused one to wonder. --rex] after forever have you ever thought about your soul-- can it be saved? or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in you grave. is god just a thought within you read in a book when you were at school? when you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool? would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope? do you think he's a fool? well i have seen the truth. yes i have seen the light and i've changed my ways. and i'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of your days. could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say if they knew you believed in god above? they should realize before they criticise that god is the only way to love. is your mind so small that you have to fall in with the pack wherever they run? will you still sneer when death is near and say they may as well worship the sun? i think it was true -it was people like you that crucified christ. i think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced. will you be so sure when your day is near to say you don't believe? you had the chance but you turned it down now you can't retrieve. perhaps you'll think before you say that god is dead & gone open your eyes, just realize that he is the one. the only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate. or will you still jeer at all you hear? yes! i think it's too late. lord of this world you're searching for your mind don't know where to start. can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart. you think you know but you are never quite sure your soul is ill but you will not find a cure. your world was made for you by someone above but you choose evil ways instead of love. you made me master of the world where you exist the soul i took from you was not even missed. lord of the world, evil possessor, lord of this world, he's now your confessor! you think you're innocent -you've nothing to fear you don't know me, you say, but isn't it clear? you turned to me in all your worldly greed and pride. but will you turn to me when it your turn to die?

[both. there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case. jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles. that's why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion. as to general jewish views on this, i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology, one by h.j. schoeps, and one whose author i can't come up with at the moment. both authors are jews. also, various christian and non-christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups. mat 5:19 is clear that the law is still valid. it does not say that it applies to gentiles. and yes, i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of gentiles. similarly circumcision. i'm not sure quite what else i can say on this subject. again, it's unfortunate the jesus didn't answer the question directly. however we do know (1) what the 1st cent. jewish approach was, (2) how jesus dealt with at least one gentile, and (3) how jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (i'm referring to acts 15 more than paul). given that these are all in agreement, i don't see that there's a big problem. --clh]

[more stuff deleted] this seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief. my beliefs are those things which i find to be true based on my experience of the world. this experience includes study of things that i may not have experienced directly. but even then, i can only understand the studies to the extent to which i can relate what i study back to what i have experienced. which means that by beliefs about god are directly related to my experience of god. having experienced god, i try to make sense of that experience. i study religion and read the bible. i find things that echo what i have already experienced. out of this i build my beliefs. i also find things that don't match my experience. that doesn't make them false. they just don't match my experience. maybe i will understand that stuff later. i don't know. maybe all of my beliefs are wrong. i can change my beliefs. if someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. neither of us are necessarily wrong. someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences. even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar. some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation. the more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider. there is another approach possible, however. god is a mystery. i am trying to solve the mystery, so i look at the evidence available to me. i try to arrive at the best understanding that i can based on the evidence. new evidence may cause me to change my understanding. when i encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery i can never fully comprehend. peace will taber ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | william taber | will_taber@dg.com 	 | any opinions expressed | | data general corp. | will@futon.webo.dg.com | are mine alone and may | | westboro, mass. 01580 | | change without notice. | |--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | when all your dreams are laid to rest, you can get what's second best, | |	but it's hard to get enough.		david wilcox | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this, but the branch davidian compound is no more. this morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank. they then started using non-lethal tear gas. shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound. so far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound. the fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside. the compound did burn to the ground. koresh, who at times has claimed to be the messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met. first, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. he claimed to be waiting for a message from god. finally, he said that god told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out. he finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. the federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they would be subjected to tear gas. i think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of god, and/or a prophet. i think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well. paul conditt

it's like refusing 'god's kingdom come'. in one of jesus' revelation in this century, "...same thing as in the old days. people refuse to believe my messengers. even when i was alive here on earth, they refuse me. what more when i am just talking through somebody else?" (paraphrased). with all the knowledge believers accumulated, he would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are 'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'. these signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from god? that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil? well, is faith in god evil? is true peace evil? is true love that is divine and pure evil? why can't someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his generous love and jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to him for salvation? why are we refusing god's messenger of this truth? the mother to all who are in christ? what brings us these: fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us? which, in contrary, could be pleasing to god? fears of being humbled? fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace, love and obedience to god? the humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints? we'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments, instead of having communion in one body with christ. what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages? why is our faith in god limited? by all the words and literature we muster? what prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend god's rich love to others who are not? why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith, hope and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) everywhere? isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural? why then does the holy mother comes back to remind us: "we must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers __even wars can be prevented__." but then she continues: "you often have an egotistic attitude. dear children, in these days you have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__." why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done: "prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the holy mass, living life as what the gospel brings."? why not do so? how? to the world? to this, the mother says: "start in your family. be a good example. live the word." why worry if it is going to be of good use to many? our holy mother says: "the fruits, __leave them to the lord__, do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord." although the holy mother does not insist because: "you are free; i bow before the freedom which god gives you." but she follows this with: "you are surprised because i say to you: decide for god and yet, see how you have lived this day." why does she constantly conveys: "take this life toward god in the way as to __experience__ the lord himself in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray" or one time when we decide that we are saved, or talk/write about god, etc. the holy mother warns: "satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer." (rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep god's commandments, and bear witness to jesus.) do you have fear or hate for god's current messenger of true peace, love and our motherly protector from the anti-christ? the one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us? this obedient and blessed new eve? the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan? haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose? why do we choose to be blind? why fear the truth that god has been giving us a chance and sharing christ's ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? the mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve. she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart. the new eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord, jesus christ; when the lamb marries his bride. shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb? why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to god's children? she has been protecting the flock (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her son's coming. not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief. with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and, of course, approval of our church authorities, we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the scripture. also, our lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers: "if you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear god? allow him room to answer you, to speak to you." she encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant faith, hope and love to jesus, constantly. not with mere emotions, but with deep, constant obedience to jesus, her beloved son and acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives. let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that god wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late. nowadays, mary says, "pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children." have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others. for without peace, you can not fully accept my son." and you think she's just an ordinary lady. not to me. she's our good mother/messenger from god and she is so nice enough to share god's kingdom to us through her son and experience it. with mary, we are assured that the lamb always succeeds. ----- note: all enclosed in quotes are from "latest news of medjugorje" number 10, june, 1991 by fr. rene' laurentin. ----- o, new mother of eden, most pure preparing the sanctuary for true christians cleansing us with peace for god's kingdom come bring us to your loving, protective and obedient church that we may belong in one body to your son, jesus christ, our lord and not go astray from his perfect completeness pray that we ourselves pray with the holy spirit guiding us so that we may help you in strength to conquer the enemies of your son while you prepare us for him with your immaculate heart.

please realize that i am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion: in article <apr.17.01.10.58.1993.2246@geneva.rutgers.edu>, mdbs@ms.uky.edu (no name) writes: > ... moreover the buddha says that we are > intrinsically good (as against christ's "we are all sinners"). i never thought of these two ideas being "against" each other. people might quibble about what "intrinsically" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. the message of christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim buddhism teaches. because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in. doesn't david ask in the 8th psalm "what is man that you [god] should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower than the angels"? i probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid david was, just as i probably exagerate what a gigantic monster goliath was, but david's power easily defeated goliath's. remember the rich young man who comes up to jesus and asks what he can do to enter the kingdom, jesus says follow the commandments. i always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an "attaboy" from the messiah. instead jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow him. jesus is raising the bar. the desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. jesus says anyone can do it, with god's help. jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires. i realize this was not your main point, but i wonder how other people see this. > ... > 	parting question: > 		would you have become a christian if you had not > been indoctrinated by your parents? you probably never learned about > any other religion to make a comparative study. and therefore i claim > you are brain washed. (please forgive any generalizations i am about to make.) your point about how "hard" other religions are is a good one, just as your "parting question" is a tough question. i think that muslims worship the same god as i do, we can learn from their name "submission". hindus and buddhists and taoists, etc. claim that "god" is impersonal. is god personal or impersonal? i say yes, but if i think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. i think it is greater to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. if i think more i must admit that god's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as his impersonal nature is beyond the hindu's conception. if somehow jesus could fit into hindu cosmology then maybe i wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine. are there any former (or present) "eastern religion" members here who could comment? chris mussack

(assuming that the pope's position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don't jointly make such choice.) if not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. if i adopt the view that "i'm not wrong, i can't be wrong, and there's no way i'll change my mind, you must change yours", that i've either left the catholic church or it has left me. the orthodox church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in ecumenical councils. we regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church. without going into the merits of the great schism, at least the orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like "he's the pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...". words aside, it appears to be a de facto split. >so where are we? are we in another arian heresy, complete with weak >popes? or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers? well, the only >way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the >traditional teaching of the church is. we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the "real" traditional teaching of the church is. if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over 900 years. >many catholics will decide to side with the pope. there is some >soundness in this, because the papacy is infallible, so eventually >some pope *will* straighten all this out. i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` i may be wrong here, i'm not roman catholic. :-) what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation? would it be honored? if not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? again, i'm not trying to be contentions, i'm trying to understand. since i'm orthodox, i've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other. >schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate >command). all schismatics are disobedient. but it's a superset, so >it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are >schismatics. the mere fact that the sspx priests don't comply with >the holy father's desires doesn't make them schismatics. it does if the command was legitimate. sspx does not view the pope's commands as legitimate. why? this is a very slippery slope. > but my problem with this is >this: according to the traditional theology of holy orders, episcopal >consecration does not confer jurisdiction. it only confers the power >of order: the ability to confect the sacraments. true enough. > jurisdiction must be >conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the >pope). the society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite >well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over >anyone. they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop. one could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. i don't know if that's even a concept or problem in catholic circles. larry overacker (llo@shell.com) -- ------- lawrence overacker shell oil company, information center houston, tx (713) 245-2965 llo@shell.com

if god is the source of his own existence, = it can only mean that he has, in terms of human time, always = existed. but this is not the same as the source of all existence. this does not preclude his existence. it only seeks to identify his *qualities* (implying he exists to *have* qualities, btw). = the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. being an atheist myself, i do not = accept such answers, since i do not have any other methods. like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive. note, i am not arguing against scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective. i seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the creator. i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer "why". it appears that m. pihko agrees (as we shall see). but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question. asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer. = : as far as i can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why". that isn't = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). = = this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us "how", = not why, something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the "why" = questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the = supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist, it is = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. my apologies. i was using why as "why did this come to be". why did pre-existence become existence. why did pre-spacetime become spacetime. but we come to the admission that science fails to answer "why?". because it can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid?

some thoughts: [a. on the non-pacifist side:] (1) killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense. i can turn my _own_ other cheek, but i have no right to turn someone else's. (2) it seems to me that if jesus had meant to teach pacifism, he would have made his position more explicit. he didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the nt is full of military metaphors. [b. on the pacifist side:] (1) apparently many early christians refused to fight in the roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice. but it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to roman policies. (2) in modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants. bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians. (3) it's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time. often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available to the general public. please, no email replies -- this is meant as a contribution to a public discussion, and anyone wanting to reply should also reply publicly. -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <><

(if anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and following orders, you might want to read about a study done by solomon ashe in 1951 on conformity, and another done by stanley milgram in 1963 on obedience. both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology. the results are both fascinating and terrifying.) darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu "we do what we're told we do what we're told we do what we're told told to do" -- peter gabriel

(colossians 3:12-15.) there is no room for selfish anger, which i'll admit i've been tempted with at times. when i've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what i would have given would have been the devil's work. i could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself. after praying and asking god's forgiveness, i was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what i had done was enough punishment. -- doug fowler: dxf12@po.cwru.edu : me, age 4 & now: "mommys and daddys & other ever wonder if, after casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it? : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"

biblical basis for the immaculate conception: 1) "i will put enmity between you [the serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel." -genesis 3.15 2) "he who commits sin is of the devil ..." -1 john 3.8 3) "hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the lord is with thee ..." -luke 1.28 from the above, we prove the doctrine of the immaculate conception. first, god has given the proto-evangel in genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of satan. "[satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him." john 8.44. now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between satan and "the woman", and enmity between satan and "her seed." now the woman is both eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and mary, the second eve. "her seed" is jesus christ, and he is also at enmity with satan in the same way as mary is said to be at enmity with satan. thus, knowing as we do that jesus christ is sinless (hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 john 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as would god's veracity. for god promised an enmity between mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for god to lie or be decieved. second, we have the angelic greeting where mary is called by the archangle gabriel "full of grace." as i pointed out above this is from the greek word "kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace. the sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the jerusalem bible, "hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace." but that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace. and as it says, "you who have been" mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later. it must be admitted that it is possible that god could have done what the doctrine of the immaclute conception says he did do. and if god could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his mother, he would have, and the bible records this fact, to which the fathers of the church such as st. john damascus, st. augustine of hippo , st. ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the pope on the matter in "ineffibilus deus." andy byler

from time to time i have made reference to a book called "the two babylons" which is a book written by alexander hislop (mid 1800's) about the babylonian mystery religion and its flight through history. i was unable to put it down the first time i read it, but others have found it dry. it has numberable references and illustrations. if you are interested in purchasing your own copy, you can call moody book store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and they will ship it to you. it is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions. i have found it invaluable for that purpose alone. but for those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended. just a note to my rc brothers and sisters. you may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of rcism. if you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination (as to whether or not it is "christian") then perhaps you should just passover this offer. to those who are a little more adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book. i really would be interested. adelphoi ev christos, rex

_my advocate_ i sinned. and straightway, posthaste, satan flew before the presence of the most high god and made a railing accusation there. he said, "this soul, this thing of clay and sod, has sinned. 'tis true that he has named thy name; but i demand his death, for thou hast said, 'the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' shall not thy sentence be fulfilled? is justice dead? send now this wretched sinner to his doom! what other thing can righteous ruler do?" thus satan did accuse me day and night; and every word he spoke, o god, was true! then quickly one rose up from god's right hand, before whose glory angels veiled their eyes; he spoke, "each jot and tittle of the law must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies! but wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred to me and that i paid his penalty! behold my hands, my side, my feet! one day i was made sin for him and died that he might be presented, faultless, at thy throne!" and satan flew away. full well he knew that he could not prevail against such love, for every word my dear lord spoke was true! 					by martha snell nicholson +++++++++++++++++++++++ i heard this poem read last night and wanted to share it with other subscribers of this newsgroup. it's such a wonderful blessing to see how secure our salvation is because the lord jesus paid for what he did not owe because we had a debt which we were not capable to pay. thanks and praise be to the savior, the lord jesus christ, who is seated at the right hand of the majesty on high, making intercession for us. ++++++++++++++++++++++++ liane brown (internet) brownli@ohsu.edu

(iliad, i think). the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians. i am not ready to conscign adam or abraham, or even cain to eternal damnation. yet they all died in their sins, in the christian sense. the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him. i do not limit the power of christ to save even him, through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment. >in my studies >of the ancient mystery reliegions, i have run across many poems or rituals or >what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him >via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing. > it was a standard belief back then. it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment. the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time. it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth. it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world. it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death. > today we think we know so much and that >if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two. >but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a >mist, not those of the older ages. > mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of time" a new light entered into the world. the light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it. much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us. our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.

[quotations omitted. this is in response to a question about the immaculate conception. i explained it, but left justification up to our catholic readers. --clh] there is no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the mention of mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the "annunciation" by angel gabriel in luke 1:26-28 and in the 6th month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee, named nazareth. to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph, of the house of david; and the virgin's name was mary. and the angel came unto her and said, _"hail, thou that art highly favoured, the lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."_ now, now, hold that line of thought - "the lord is with mary & blessed art thou among women" - while you read on.... in the book, "first lady of the world, a popular history of devotion to mary" by peter lappin: the _immaculate conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _assumption_. this arose in 430 ad. it is quite possible that the feast of _mary's conception_ under the title "the conception of saint anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as elizabeth had conceived john the baptist. a transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in anne to the miracle of grace wrought by god in the soul of mary was _logical_. mary is the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of christ's sinless body"; she is "god's eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms." her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in christ, her purity in that of the father. at the time of the council of ephesus, she was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of eve". ... at the end of the thirteenth century, an irish franciscan, john duns scotus (1266-1308),...god maintained that it was a greater thing for him to preserve his (the son) mother from all sin _than to use his power to clease her from it later_. ... now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. from "pocket catholic cathechism" by john a. hardon: baptism - concupiscence remains after baptism. concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of christ jesus, manfully resist (canon 5). original gifts of adam and eve before their fall: in the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -they had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely. -the had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -they had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace, the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven. by their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely. baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by adam's sin. it _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day... going back to _immaculate conception_ (i am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'): given the miracle of st. anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, and christ was not yet born and _there was no baptism yet_ on mary's birth but still, the angel gabriel's greetings was: "hail mary, full of grace, the lord is with you. blessed art thou amongst women". even mary was confused about this greeting. mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (adam and eve before their sin): hail mary (example of praise given by the angel gabriel) full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural) the lord is with you (at those times, god would definitely want to be with those he has made _blessed_) blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all) at the conception, god made mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of christ and so, immaculate conception of mary is true and mary still has maintained her immaculate heart. -marida (p.s. i do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter. thanks.)

international ahmadiyya muslim community in particular. type: ==== the group will be moderated for orderly and free religious dialo- gue. the moderation will not prevent disagreement, dissent, or controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather, the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga- tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter. the moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups. the following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon: moderator: nabeel a. rana <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu> co-moderator: dr. tahir ijaz <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca> a brief description about ahmadiyya islam: =============================================== the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi- sation, was found in 1889 in qadian, india. the founder of this movement, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. he claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised messiah. the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers. even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the muslim regimes. the right of ahmadi muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims has been severely restricted in many muslim countries. the united nations, human rights organizations such as amnesty international and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail. despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds. the movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. ahmadi muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism. among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources. the movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals. the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood. newsgroup creation: ================== the discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. voting will be held for three weeks. if the news- group gets 2/3rd majority and 100 more "yes/create" votes than "no/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. about the vote-taker: ==================== mr. anthony lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. he has no objection to use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. neither the university of colora- do, nor anthony lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup. they are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party. questions or comments: ===================== any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to: nabeel a. rana <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu> any questions or problems in voting should be sent to: anthony lest <lest@ucsu.colorado.edu>

undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but i suspect that a biggie is that the god they've believed in is (in j.b. phillips's words) "too small". if a person's understanding of god is not allowed to grow and develop, it will eventually become inadequate. the grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke. a therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they "fire god". what she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of god to make room for a fuller one. but she follows up by encouraging them to "hire a new one". my guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing process, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire. billh

hello src readers, again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox churches believe in monophysitism pops up again. we had a discussion about it a while ago. in article <may.6.00.34.58.1993.15426@geneva.rutgers.edu> db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (d. andrew byler) writes: > >the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism. this was a >heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in 451 ad. it >grew up in reaction to nestorianism, which held that the son and jesus >are two different people who happened to be united in the same body >temporarily. monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia >and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox. then ofm comments : > > >[these issues get mighty subtle. when you see people saying different >things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously >different things, or whether they are using different terminology. i >don't think there's any question that there is a problem with >nestorius, and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form >without a real human nature or will is heretical. but i'd like to be >a bit wary about the copts, armenians, etc. recent discussions >suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from >orthodoxy as many had thought. with my appreciation to the moderator, i believe that further elaboration is needed. this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the copt-net newsletter : under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of rome), the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played leading roles in christian theology. they were invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith. st. cyril, pope of alexandria, was the head of the ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year 430 a.d. it was said that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings. this leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs. it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church. the response of st. dioscorus, the pope of alexandria who was later exiled, to this interference was clear: "you have nothing to do with the church." these political motives became even more apparent in chalcedon in 451, when the coptic church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of eutyches, who believed in monophysitism. this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine. the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon! in that council, monophysitism meant believing in one nature. copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity, and he is perfect in his humanity, but his divinity and his humanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word", which was reiterated by st. cyril of alexandria. copts, thus, believe in two natures "human" and "divine" that are united in one "without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration" (from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy). these two natures "did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy). the coptic church was misunderstood in the 5th century at the council of chalcedon. perhaps the council understood the church correctly, but they wanted to exile the church, to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian, independent pope. despite all of this, the coptic church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith. whether it was a conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church as a punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether pope dioscurus didn't quite go the extra mile to make the point that copts are not monophysite, the coptic church has always felt a mandate to reconcile "semantic" differences between all christian churches. this is aptly expressed by the current 117th successor of st. mark, pope shenouda iii: "to the coptic church, faith is more important than anything, and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to us." throughout this century, the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement. the coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches. it has remained a member of that council since 1948 a.d. the coptic church is a member of the all african council of churches (aacc) and the middle east council of churches (mecc). the church plays an important role in the christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the catholic, greek orthodox, presbyterian, and evangelical churches. [...] as a final note, the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of christology, in which the heresey of monophysitism was condemned. so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism. peace, nabil .-------------------------------------------------------------. / nabil ayoub ____/ __ / ____/ / / engine research center / / / / / / dept. of mechanical engineering ___/ __ / / / / university of wisconsin-madison / / | / / / email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu _____/ __/ _| _____/ / '-------------------------------------------------------------' [as i mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me is confused. i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite. as andrew byler correctly stated it, the nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties. the point i was making, which nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren't. chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the alexandrians and antiochenes. it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes. i agree that there were extremes that were heretical. however in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented. and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine. there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps. this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians. there are also a remaining nestorians. like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called nestorians are not heretical either. they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition. --clh]

mark ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might think, contradict my posting in which i said that the catholic church believes that public revelation, on which catholic doctrine is based, ended with the death of st. john, the last apostle. in that posting i made sure i used the word "public". public revelation contains god's truth intended for everyone to believe. the revelation contained in the bible is a significant subset of public revelation. private revelation is revelation that god gives to an individual. he may speak directly to the individual, he may send an angel, or he may send the virgin mary or some lesser saint. the only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not. when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the church may investigate it. if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god, it will be approved. that means that it can be preached in the church. however, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from god. a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at fatima and lourdes. (i suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox catholics in good standing.) i do not have at hand a list of the criteria the church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something i need every day--but i know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- marty helgesen bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu "what if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?"

michael bushnell writes; >the so-called creed of athanasius, however, has always been a western >creed, and has always had the filioque. the orthodox have said that >they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but >it is not "in use." which is exactly what i pointed out. (though i was wrong about your use of the creed, the 1913 catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it said the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque. apparently that has changed.) the athanasian creed has always had the filioque, the nicene - constantinopolitan did not. 	of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the athanasian creed, which did have it from the beginning. 	i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity, the east emphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father through the son, and the west using proceeding from the father and the son. in fact, some, such as tertullian, used both formulations (see below) 	"following, therefore, the form of these examples, i profess that i do call god and his word, - the father and and his son, - two. for the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it. where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three. the spirit, then, is third from god and the son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray." 	-tertullian, against praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 ad) and 	"i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son" 	-tertullian, against praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 ad) and as st. thomas showed in his summa theologica part 1, question 36, articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what st. augustine, among others taught, that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son, but he proceeds from the father in a more preeminent way. 	"for whatever the son has, he has from the father, certainly he has it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him ... for the father alone is not from another, for which reason he alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great. the son, however, is born of the father; and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father, and since the father gives to the son all that he has without any interval of time, the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son. he would be called son of the father and of the son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten him. the spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both." 	-st. augustine of hippo, the trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 ad) so, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the west at least), because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son, but in proceeding from the son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the father, so the holy spirit is proceeding from the father through the son, but as all that the son has is from the father, the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father, without any mention of the son being necessary. 	in any case, i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope st. leo i, st. fulgence of ruspe, st. cyril of alexandria, pope st. damsus i, st. augustine of hippo, st. epiphanius of salamis, st. ambrose of milan, st. hilary of poitiers, tertullian, and others among the fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic position, which i enunciated above. 	as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden, i will point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the fathers of nicea." that creed is a different creed than that of constantinople, which is commonly called the nicene creed. not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed, which is but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious, who had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by the church, which among other things denied the procession of the holy spirit form the son. thus, the additions of the constantinopolitan creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the council chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son, which nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it. and if the further explanations of the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians in spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until many years later under photius and others. and that the filioque was not disputed, i provide more quotes below. 	"since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to god, and he actually proceeds from the father and son, it is abundantly clear that he is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it." 	-st. cyril of alexandria, the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity, thesis 34, (423-425 ad) 	"the holy spirit is not of the father only, or of the son only, but he is the spirit of the father and the son. for it is written: `if anyone loves the world, the spirit of the father is not in him'; and again it is written: `if anyone, however, does not have the spirit of christ, he is none of his.' when the father and the son are named in this way, the holy spirit is understood, of whom the son himself says in the gospel, that the holy spirit `proceeds from the father,' and that `he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'" 	-pope st. damasus i, the decree of damasus, 1 (382 ad) 	"the only-begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father, but is called holy spirit, and is not foreign to the father. for the only-begotten himself calls him: `the spirit of the father,' and says of him the `he proceeds from the father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the son, but is of their same substance, of the same godhead; he is spirit divine, ... of god, and he is god. for he is spirit of god, spirit of the father, and spirit of the son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son, a third by appelation.... 	"the father always existed and the son always existed, and the spirit breathes from the father and the son; and neither is the son created nor is the spirit created." 	-st. epiphanius of salamis (which is on cyprus), the man well-anchored, 8 and 75 (374 ad) 	"concerning the holy spirit, i ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak. still, on account of those who do not know him, it is not possible for me to be silent. however it is necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledged, who is from the father and the son, his sources." 	-st. hilary of poitiers, the trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 ad) 	thus, as i have pointed out before, gaul, spain, italy, africa, egypt, palastine, and the lands of the greeks, all of christnedom at that time, all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque. i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the fathers, besides st. john of damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views. it is not enough to bring up the "proceeds from the father" line of the creed or the gospel of john, for that says what we believe also. but it does not say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son, only that he does proceed from the father. andy byler

let me tell you my story. i grew up catholic. up until i was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. then i met a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not imposing. i tried to get into being as christian as i could, as i felt i 'should'. but the more i tried, the more depressed i got. i felt guilty for some of my own personal, honest feelings. i tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until i was 23. then i taught myself to think rationally. i read a lot of books, pro and con religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. i came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now i am a staunch atheist. this is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it. now, (at 26) i feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally stronger person. i have well-defined goals. i have a strong and stable sense of morals and values. i am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. i believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. i am very anti-violent and anti-hatred. (this is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) religion has no place in my system. tough. bertrand russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove it. so, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. but, for all practical purposes there is no god. thanqs ken engel kene@acs.bu.edu

maxwell c muir writes: just a quick question. if mary was immaculately concieved, so she could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being? is this why she is held so highly in the catholic church despite it's basically patriarchical structure? she was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to original sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god. she is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to god, and everything that flows from that relationship. the catholic church sees her as the new eve. (the fathers in the early church use this particular figure a lot.) eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense. mary is the mother of all the living in the order of grace. as sin came through eve, so grace -- jesus christ -- came through mary.

mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (mail server) writes: | one thing i don't understand is why being sacred should make the | temple rituals secret. the "so sacred it's secret" explanation is a bit misleading. while there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public. but since public discussion is often irreverent, most mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned. but there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself. | granted, the gnostic "christians" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-christian mystery religions. there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter. one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was written by their enemies. eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret information to peter, james, and john after his resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve (eusebius, _historia ecclesiastica_ ii 1:3-4). irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_against heresies_ iv 33:8), but eusebius disagrees. he claims the secret ceremonies of the christian church perished with the apostles. interestingly enough, eusebius refers to the groups which we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (eusebius, op. cit., iii, 32:7-8). his gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one. writings dealing with jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately. in one story, simon magus opens a dialog with peter on the nature of god. peter's response is "you seem to me not to know what a father and a god is: but i could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_clementine recognitions_ ii, 60). if any one theme underlies the _recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached. now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways. i don't intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do, but i believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today. | neither new testament | christianity nor biblical judaism made a secret of their practices. but if judaism and christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents? one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship. yes, you could establish that mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship. on that basis, can we conclude that the bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist? mormon scholar dr. hugh nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which i have taken a few: 1. "it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given" (matt. 13:11). 2. "all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given" (matt. 19:11). 3. "i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now" (john 16:12). 4. "the time cometh, when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but i shall shew you plainly of the father" (john 16:25). 5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter" (1 cor. 3:1-2). 6. "many things ... i would not write with paper and ink; but i ... come unto you and speak face to face" (2 jn. 1:12). (nibley, _since cumorah_, pp. 92-94) again, these can also be interpreted many different ways. i believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly. | i have heard that joseph smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the freemasons. anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true? historically, joseph smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the freemasons. there is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after smith became a mason. it can be argued that smith had ample exposure to masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother hyrum (a mason), though no specific connection has yet been established. my conversations with masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism is fairly tenuous. as our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony. i believe that critics who charge that mormon rites were lifted from freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ jay windley * university of utah * salt lake city jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ...there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of > repeated lives on earth. there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion, clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation. i don't remember which one it is off of the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: jesus is talking with the apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come, elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come, but they did not recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. can anyone offer a reasonable alternative interpretation? i would be very interested to hear it.

i just thought i'd share a nice experience before my exam today. i was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change i might have. i had a dollar or so that i gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (i generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at mcdonalds or something) - i offered her some "spiritual gifts," as i called them, rather than gifts of money. i talked of how great i felt that god had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. she talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all i know), but that they felt a very special love in the lord, an unselfish kind of caring. it warmed my heart to know that 2 people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are indeed very rich. a good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more, more; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought. -- doug fowler: dxf12@po.cwru.edu heaven is a great big hug that lasts forever "and when that one great scorer comes to mark against your name; he writes, not whether you've won or lost, but how you played the game" --grantland rice

likewise post-ascension. i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him. it was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in gethsemane (since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed. comments on the above warmly appreciated. jason albert [there may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin". the original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call jesus fully human, because he didn't sin. i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation. i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human. i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human. i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism. i agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical. there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian. i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents, i thought he got the better of them. however, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance, and that nestorius was at the very least "rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "the christological controversy" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own. as regular usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong. furthermore, he did say some things that i think are problematical. he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet. in it he says "to attribute also to [the logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others. those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ... these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood." it's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity. but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have "to some degree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying. of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the logos' participation in these things. but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all. nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area. you say "i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus's human nature was in heaven." i don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine. it's the divine logos that is eternal. --clh]

a few points about mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth: one piece of evidence for mary's assumption into heaven is the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. some christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of peter, mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of mary, the greatest of the saints. why? because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven. although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being crowned in the heavens. of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the church. the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to christ. jesus, perfect god and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly. under the law god gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave. one last point: an ex-catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary did not die. this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe. the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die. in fact, the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die. this would make sense: christ died, and his mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death. brian finnerty
i posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to have appeared on the newsgroup, and i haven't had a reply from the moderator. we were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. please excuse me if you have seen this before... should christians fight? last week alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there are such things as "justifiable wars". i have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as i go. i haven't answered all his questions yet, and i know what i have here is on a slightly different tack, but possibly i'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post some more info soon. our duty to our neighbour: do good to all men (gal 6:10) love our neighbour as ourselves (matt 22:39) act the part of the good samaritan (luke 10) toward any who may be in trouble. we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm (even medical corps of the army etc). christians are by faith "citizens of the commonwealth of israel" (ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that "god rules in the kingdoms of men", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith. we are to be "strangers and pilgrims" amongst the nations, so we are just passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). we are not supposed to "strive" or "resist evil" (even "suffer yourselves to be defrauded") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up god's kingdom. our duty to the state. "render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar's and unto god the things which be god's" (luke 20:25). "let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. for there is no power but of god; the powers that be are ordained of god. whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of god" (rom 13:1-2). "submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake; whether it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men" (1 pet 2:13-15) these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command, but it is equally clear from acts 5:19-29 that when any ordinance of man runs counter to god's law, we must refuse submission to it. the reason for this is that we are god's "bond servants" and his service is our life's task. an example of the type of thing is in col 3:22-23 where bondservants were to "work heartily as unto the lord" - so also we should work as if our boss was god - i.e. "pressed down, shaken together, and running over"... oops - a bit of a side track there... in the contests between the nations, we are on god's side - a side that is not fighting in the battle, but is "testifying" to the truth. when we believe in god and embrace his promises, we become "fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god", and are no longer interested in associations of the world. think of this in relation to unions etc as well. paul tells us to "lay aside every weight" that we may run "the race that is set before us", and if we are wise, we will discard any association which would retard our progress - "thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ. no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier" (2 tim 2:3-4). one of these entanglements he warns about is "be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers". one of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about god (in this case the army). the principle comes from deut 22:10 - remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one unclean under the law. these ideas are strongly stressed in 2 cor 6:13-18 - i suggest you read this. the yoking also has another aspect - that of servitude, and jesus says "take my yoke upon you", so we are then yoked with christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. we have already seen that we are bondservants of christ, and paul says "become not ye the bondservants of men (1 cor 7:23 rv). an example from the old testament: the question is asked in 2 chr 19:2 "shouldest thou help the ungodly...?". the situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers. jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. here are the facts: 1. he had made an affinity with ahab, who had "sold himself to work wickedness before the lord" (1 kings 21:25). 2. when asked by ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said "i am as thou art, my people as thy people" (1 kings 22:4) - an unequal yoking. 3. he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the lord (trying to do the right thing), he found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil association he had made. god says to us "come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing, and i will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters" (2 cor 6:17). this is more or less what i have found out so far - i'm still looking into it, as i don't think i've answered all the questions raised by alastair yet. heres a summary and a few things to think about: the christian in under command. obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with christ (john 15:10,14). total dedication to this course of action is required (romans 12:1-2). disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his followers (1 pet 2:7-8). we are to be separated to god (rom 6:4). this involves a master-servant relationship (rom 6:12,16). no man can serve two masters (matt 6:24,13,14). all that is in the 'kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to gos (1 john 2:16). christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. if christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another master. strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to anyone but god. the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 tim 2:24) - this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives. there is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 cor 10:3-4), but with god's armour (eph6:13-20). i'll probably post some more when i've had time to look into things a bit further. -- gideon king | phone +64-3-479 8347 university of otago | fax +64-3-479 8529 department of computer science | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz p.o. box 56 | dunedin | next mail preferred! new zealand |
heres the life of st. maria goretti, posted with kind permission of the editor of the australian catholic magazine "morning star". hope you like it. put up with anything to prevent sin st. maria goretti maria was born on october 16th 1890 to luigi and assunta goretti, the eldest daughter in the family of seven. she was a cheerful girl, always imitating her parents. she had but one disire, but one wish: to receive our lord in the blessed sacrament. the date was finally set for little maria to receive our lord on the feast of corpus christi. for maria, time seemed like an eter- nity as she slowly neared the great day. when it finally arrived, fr. jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the mass and give the children their first holy communion) delivered a sermon on	the immense love of jesus christ for them and the great love we should have in return for him. he then warmly urged them to die rather than commit a mortal sin. maria humbly approached the altar of god and received the holy eucharist.	her only sadness was the thought of her father's absence, who died some time beforehand. as for the	rest of the day, maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is until 				 -4- her thoughts changed to when she could go next to holy communion. thus ended the happiest day of maria's life. over the next twelve months, maria had changed from a giggling little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. as her mother went out into the fields in place of her husband,	maria took on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties. she was doing this not only for her own family, but also for the serenellis, a father and son who lived with the goretti's, owning a share in the farm. although maria was poorer than all the other children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. in all thi ngs she did the holy will of god. during the month of june, alessandro serenelli(the son)	twice made advances upon maria when he chanced to be alone with her. on both occasions maria managed to struggle free of alessandro's strong grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she even uttered a word to her mother. from this day on, maria	lived in terror, fearing lest alessandro attack again. on july 5th 1902, alessandro left work in the fields to "get a handkerchief," as	he claimed. he went to the storeroom beneath the house where maria, who was outside on the landing with the baby, could hear him fumbling about in with tools. she wondered what he was doing. it was later learned that he was sharpening a 91/2" blade. he went to the house and called for maria. she told him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. he stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. mar ia instantly realized what he was up to. "no, no, no! do not	touch me! it is a sin, you will go to hell!" at this point alessandro held the knife over maria's chest, who was now on the floor. "will you or will you not?" maria gathered all her energy.	"no i will not,	alessandro, no!" she had chosen her martyrdom over sin, god over satan. overcome with rage, alessandro plunged the knife into maria's breast fourteen times. finally he came to his senses and thought maria was dead. frantically he threw the knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room. the crying of the baby teresa	on the landing brought the	attention to assunta and the father of alessandro. as the baby was unattended and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house to find maria, who, covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door. when asked what happened she said alessandro stabbed her. "he wanted to make me do wrong and i would not." the ambulance arrived, then the police who took alessandro	away. as	the ambulance	carried maria to the hospital, a large crowd followed on foot. the doctors at the hospital held no hope for poor little maria. the same fr. jerome who gave maria her first communion 				 -5- came to administer the last rites and to give her holy viaticum. he asked maria if she would forgive her murderer. "yes. for the love of jesus i forgive him. i wish for him to one day join me in	paradise. may god forgive him, for i alread y have." maria died at about three o'clock. alessandro was tried and found guilty of maria's death but because of his age he was sentenced to only thirty years in prison. after eight years of being a violent prisoner and show- ing no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the midst of a field of flowers, maria holding out a bunch of white lilies to him. soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging god's par- don for the grave sin he had committed. he later gave testimony in	maria's beatification in 1947. less than three years later, on ju ne 24th 1950, maria was canonised. assunta goretti was the first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation. may st. maria goretti help	us to	be pure and grant us the strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin. saint maria goretti, pray for us. by brendan arthur -- internet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au viva cristo rey !! long live christ the king.
could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views children born out of wedlock? in particular i'm interested to know if any stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents. i'm especially keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical book the mormons keep in salt lake city. if this is an issue on which the "official" position has changed over time, i'm interested in learning both old and new beliefs. e-mail or posting is fine. all information or pointers are appreciated. elliotte rusty harold		department of mathematics elharo@shiva.njit.edu		new jersey institute of technology erh0362@tesla.njit.edu		newark, nj 07102

(hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...) a few times lately when i've observed some either out-and-out sinful activity, or just some self-destructive activity, i've gotten a strong impression that many folks really don't know any better. christ's pity on the crowds as being "like sheep without a shepherd" rings true to me. if these folks don't have a clue, do i bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way? worse still; have i expressed judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any positive relationship whereby i might pass along anything positive? i _know_ i've got something to repent about on that score. anyway, it's a real interesting question. -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ .......... .. . . . . . university of nebraska - lincoln . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grace . . . . . . . . . . . . happens .

i deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce. in article <may.7.01.10.03.1993.14583@athos.rutgers.edu> crs@carson.u.washington.edu (cliff slaughterbeck) writes: > >along the way, she was married, happily, to a wonderful and >supportive husband and gave birth to two sons. still, everything was not >perfect for jane, since she could never open up the deepest part of her >soul to her husband. she always found that she could be much closer to >her women friends than to her husband, as good and loing as a husband as >he might be. she struggled very much with this until at the age of 38, she >decided that she was a lesbian. when she came home to announce this >understanding of herself, her husband told her that he had come to the same >understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that >realization in her own time. her children ages 9 and 11 at the time were >also extremely supportive of her. as the youngest put it, "that just >means that you love people very much." jane and her husband agreed to >divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the >extended family to this day. >one of the interesting things that jane said in this whole discussion was >"homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom." she found that >she was much more able to have a deep, committed relationship with a woman >than a man. sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole relationship. >the key thing is how one interconnects with other people. she made a >specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man, >since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years. (take a few >seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications!!!) i have thought about the implications, and it is scary. we have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman. if we accept that it is legitimate for jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more "deep, committed relationship." marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed. is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde? the real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort. hold fast to the faith. has not the lord repeatedly compared his relation to his people as a faithful and enduring husband? we learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial. my spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. if it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to god!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations. that's life...the lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my "needs." the idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple "grows apart" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that i feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise. we have become so petty and small-minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight! i praise the lord for guiding me to marry my wife. she married me anyway despite the possibility that i could have a terrible illness. and it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, but had i known i wouldn't have cared either. and maybe i'll be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down. a married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the lord, not divorce and run away from them.
i was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple ceremony within the last fifty years.... also, why do you think they were made (revelation, assimilation to mainstream christianity, etc.)? i know that the god makers was published quite a while ago. could rituals have been changed since then? i am also very interested in the influence of freemasonry on early mormonism, especially in the smith family and in the nauvoo settlement. info on any new studies would be appreciated. thanks, freddie eaton llcoolj@athena.mit.edu
can someone cite biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than leviticus? so far, when i ask, around here, i get the verses from leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-). later, max (bob) muir [the list was posted not long ago, as i recall, aside from lev, commonly cited passages are: the story of sodom. note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong. i take an intermediate position on this: note that sodom is referred to elsewhere in the bible for its sinfulness. it doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality. rather, i think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. however from what we know of jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described. (it almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.) but this story is not specifically about homosexuality. in the nt, the clear references are all from paul's letters. in rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry. homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry. there are a number of arguments over this passage. it does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. so it's not what i'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. but it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards homosexuality. the other passages occur in lists of sins, in i cor 6:9, and i tim 1:10. unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean. there have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as "wanton", and that another may be specifically "male prostitute". again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that paul shared the ot's negative judgement on homosexuality. jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant. the context in jude involves angels. since those who were almost raped in sodom were angels, it seems likely that "strange flesh" refers to intercourse with angels. as you can see, the nt evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the bible. conservatives note that the passages from paul's letters imply that he accepted the ot prohibition. this is enough for them to regard it as having nt endorsement. liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship? what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?). thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the gospel. this is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various greek words. but it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant. what it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the gospel. this appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. this is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between protestant and catholic in the 16th cent, and one where both sides believe that the bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses. that makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely... --clh]
a listmember (d andrew killie, i think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god: > any god who works that way is indescribably evil, > and unworthy of my worship or faith. nobuya "higgy" higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others): > where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god's > behavior? it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god's actions. who is the clay to talk back to the potter? but we find a contrary view in scripture. when god proposes to destroy the city of sodom (genesis 18), abraham says: + suppose that there are some good men in the city. + will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + far be it from you, lord, to do such a thing! + shall not the judge of all the earth do right? i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + shame on you, lord, if you do such a thing! there are those who say that the definition of "good" is "whatever god happens to want." but if that is so, then the statement that god is good has no meaning. it simply says that god does what he wants. that being the case, no one can either love or obey god because he is good. the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful. just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey god, because he has the power to punish you if you don't. this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis 18 and to christianity in general. any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of god) meaningless. however, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result. when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us. moreover, leaving the scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, i find that nature is often very different from what i might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity. (origen said: "those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature.") now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of god. on the contrary, their absence would be such an argument. suppose that i am watching bobby fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, i find myself nodding and saying: "good move! just what i was expecting him to do. same move i would have made if i were playing." that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself. given that he is better, i expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, "now, what do suppose induced him to do that?" or even, "boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!" similarly, if god understands the workings of the universe better than i do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake. one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess game. if fisher wins, i revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. however, if he loses, and particularly if i can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought. with god, on the other hand, i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions. therefore, my grounds for judging that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** in the book of genesis, we read that joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt. there he eventually became viceroy, and when there was a famine in canaan, he was able to provide for his family. when his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: "do not worry. you meant to do me evil, but god turned it into good." i once heard a rabbi speak on this text. he said: the history of the jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion, or the people, or both. but, amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism. the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family. but in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them. the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like a misfortune for them. but in fact, if they had stayed in canaan, they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture. their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a disaster. but god used it to bring them out of egypt, and into the promised land. here the people built a temple, and regularly offered sacrifices. but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea, destroyed temple and city and countryside, and deported most of the people to babylon. you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion. but it was not. living in canaan, the people had been under constant danger of assimilation. again and again, they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice. the babylonian captivity put a stop to that. never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry. neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had a foothold among them. nor is that all. judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances. the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice. during the captivity, with the temple gone, the jews invented the synagogue, a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures. they came to realize clearly, what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea, that god is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the controller of the land of canaan, or the patron of the jewish people, but the creator of the world, and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere. time passed, and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians, and then that of the greeks, or rather the macedonians. the ruler, antiochus epiphanes, was determined to stamp out judaism, and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death. again, one might think that this would be the end of judaism. but it was not. the people met for worship, and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss that. before this time, the torah, the so-called five books of moses (genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy) were the only books read and studied in the synagogue. if it had not been for antiochus, the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether. his hatred for judaism saved them. [other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.] some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady. when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it, everyone expected that julie, who had been so magnificent on stage, would play the same role in the movie. instead, the studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast audrey hepburn. julie andrews was naturally crushed. but she later realized that if she had played the screen role, she would have been type-cast for life as an elize doolittle type. it would have been a disaster for her. as it was, walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins, and she won an oscar for it. at the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking at walt disney, she said, "and now, my special thanks to the man who made all this possible -- jack warner!" it was the most memorable line of the evening. in a similar spirit, we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism, and kept it alive to this day, beginning with joseph's brothers, and continuing with two pharaohs, with nebuchadnezzar, with antiochus epiphanes.... after the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, "you were talking about the holocaust, weren't you?" he answered, "if that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, i was talking about it to you. but i would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it." i assume that he meant that, without the holocaust, there would have been no state of israel. someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god's doing -- that he stirred up joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the israelites were in egypt, god hardened pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about. i suggest another way of looking at it. consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. but the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. the sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: "how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art." in reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. if the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. so, if joseph's brothers had not sold him, god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people, but he would have done so in another manner. if judas had not betrayed jesus, if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus, but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god, if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion, and therefore no redemption, and therefore no salvation. not so. god did not need judas' sin to redeem us. if judas had done right, then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself. we do not know how, just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station, and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--i am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid). thus, we may say both (1) that god used, say, the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not god's doing, and that pilate would not have thwarted god's plans by behaving justly and courageously. what, then, are we to make of the place where god says to moses, "i will harden pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go"? some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet with god pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of god in him. i suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this: "if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. my purposes will not be thwarted. if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. if he does not, i will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me." to return to the question that started this all off. is it possible that the serbs, in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia, are instruments of god's will? first point. what they are doing is wrong, just as what joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what judas did was wrong. they intend it for evil. if god somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment. second point. of course, god will bring good out of it. but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right. yours, james kiefer
hi damon, no matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation from nothing, or creation from something. there are no other alternatives. and if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan. if it was random, i am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do. therefore i am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme. i call that intelligence god. i also prefer the "creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner. there is obviously no way to prove either or neither. we are and we must have come from somewhere. choose whatever explanation you feel most comfortable with, damon. you are the one who has to live with your choice. shalom, len howard

(if all else fails :-) >show me where i'm wrong. 	you're not wrong! it is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as i will explain below. "that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture, except the canonical scriptures, and the canoncial scriptures are - genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, deuteronomy, joshua, judges, ruth, four books of kingdoms [being 1&2 samuel and 1&2 kings], two books of paralpomenon [being 1&2 chronicles], job, the psalter of david, the five books of solomon [being proverbs, ecclesiastes, song of songs, wisdom of solomon, and [misatributed to him] the wisdom of jesus son of sirach], the books of the twelve (minor) prophets, isaiah, jeremiah [being jeremiah, the lamentations, baruch, and the letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], ezekiel, daniel, tobit, judith, esther, two books of ezra [being ezra and nehemiah], two books of maccabees. and of the new testament: four books of the gospel, one book of the acts of the apostles, thirteen letters of paul the apostle, one letter of the same to the hebrews, two of peter the apostle, three of john, one of the apostle jude, one of the apostle james, one book of the apocalypse of john." 	-council of hippo, statute 36, (393 ad) 	this same list was promulgated again at the third council of carthage (397 ad), and at the sixth council of carthage (419 ad) - at which council the same list was enumerated with the words "because we have recieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in the church." which ought to quiet those who assert "in the name of holy scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the church," as the episcopal church does in removing the deuterocanon from the realm of scripture. (though the episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the church, they are not counted as scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma. the lutherans hold out similarly.) 	earlier mention of the so-called apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below i inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers. "and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the hebrew alphabet].... it is to be noted also that by adding to these tobias and judith, there are twenty-four books, corresponding to the number of letters used by the greeks." 	-st. hillary of poitiers, "commentaries on the psalms," prologue, 15 (365 ad) "the twenty-two books according to the hebrews are .... jeremiah, with lamentations and the letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is maccabees." 	-origen, "commentaries on the psalms," psalm 1 (245 ad) "divine scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful .... says most excellently [baruch 3.16-19 follows]." 	-st. clement of alexandria, "the instuctor of children," 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 ad) "....i learned accurately the books of the old testament ... proverbs of solomon, and also wisdom ..." 	-st. melito of sardes, fragment found in eusebius' "history of the church," and dating from crica 177 ad, book 4, 26, 14 "it is likewise decreed: now, indeed, we must treat of the divine scriptures: what the universal catholic church accepts and what she must shun. the list of the old testament .... wisdom, one book; ecclesiasticus, one book .... tobit, one book .... judith, one book; of maccabees, two books." 	-st. damasus i, pope, "the decree of damsus," section 2 (382 ad) 	i would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the church has always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed by various persons. for if disputes involving the new testament deutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. hebrews, james, 2 peter, 2&3 john, jude, revelation) in protestant eyes, than neither should it disqulaify the old testament books. and i must point out that the jews only drew up their canon in 90 ad, 60 years after the founding of the christian religion upon the cross. why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon? as early as 150 ad, st. justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the canon of scripture by their removal of certain books. protestants apparently prefer to think that god's revelation was limited by a decree of the jews in the ordering of their (the jews') faithless canon, and that he could not use other people, like the apostles, in drawing up the canon. the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint, as some 80% of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint, and not the hebrew. and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon.

peir-yuan yeh asks: >i wonder if the ot is not exactly like jewish history. are they the same >or part of them are the same? how about torah? are the first five books >of ot as the same as torah????? yes, yes, and yes. jewish history as recorded in the old testament and as shown by archaeology are the same. kings, revivals, temples, and all. the torah, as far as i know, is the five books of moses. then come the prophets (all the prophets, plus joshua, judges, 1&2 samuel, 1&2 kings) and the writings (psalms, proverbs, lamentations, ruth, esther, ezra, nehemiah, ecclesiates, song of songs, 1&2 chronicles, job). and the veracity of isaiah, which you quoted to your moslem friend is quite well known. a complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 bc, and is kept in a museum in israel. it was found among the dead sea scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the old testament, as they date back to around the time of christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in hebrew was from around 900 ad. your moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so. if jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been god, for only the death of god could atone for the sins of all humanity. and as isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty god." and if he was god, then he must have rose, for as st. paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him. and if jesus rose from the dead, your moslem friend would have little reason to be a moslem. which is why he denies the authenticity of the old testament. andy byler

(luke 22.20), the cup represents the new covenant and holds the blood of redemption). the fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the catholic church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the church shows the crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the holy sacrafice of the mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as malachi predicted in malachi 1.11, "from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation, for my name is great among the gentiles, says the lord of hosts." and so we acknowledge what st. paul wrote "for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the lord's death until he comes." (1 corinthians 11.26) 	you are quite right about the identification of "babylon the great, mother of all harlots" with rome. i think we simply disagree as to what time period of rome the apostle john is talking about. andy byler
hal heydt writes: >that was only the fall of the *western* empire. the *eastern* empire >continued for another 1000 years--and a key element in it's fall was >the *christian* sack of constantinople. note that i said the fall of rome, not of the empire. the roman empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in constantinople. the main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of constantinople by the men of the 4th crusade (who were not christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the christian city of zara in croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of mazinkert. after the turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the empire fell, the inability of the empire to hold onto the rim of anatolia, with the ottomans and rum seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history. the sack of constantinople only hastened the inevitable along. for if the greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the crusaders when they came to do battle with the saracens in the 1st-3rd crusades? because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the cause of the empire and christendom in doing battle with the turkish hordes in anatolia, edessa, lebanon, palastine, and syria, the some hordes who were to later sack constantinople, and overrun a third of europe (the balkans, hungary, the ukraine, the caucasus, etc.) andy byler

vera shanti noyes writes; >this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination. >am i correct? i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all >choose whether or not we will accept god's gift of salvation to us. >again, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved. of course i believe in predestination. it's a very biblical doctrine as romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages). furthermore, the church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning. but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will. men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of god. however, unlike the calvinists and jansenists, i hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god (1 timothy 2.4). for god must give enough grace to all to be saved. but only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven. this does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell. 							 ^^^^^^^^^^^ people who are saved are saved by the grace of god, and not by their own effort, for it was god who disposed them to himself, and predestined them to become saints. but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish. thus, they were deserving of god;s punishment, as they had rejected their creator, and sinned against the working of the holy spirit. >yes, it is up to god to judge. but he will only mete out that >punishment at the last judgement. well, i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those he can't bless in the next life, he blesses in this one. and those he will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins. every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 samuel 12.13-14, david's sin of adultery and murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.) and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god's judgement is quite prevelant in the bible. sodom and gommorrah, moses barred from the holy land, the slaughter of the cannanites, annias and saphira, jerusalem in 70 ad, etc. > if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more >innocent? we should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u.s. or even the u.n. involved? i do not think so, but i am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general. but in the case of bosnia, i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a "just war." "blessed" after all, "are the peacemakers" was what our lord said, not the interventionists. our actions in bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us. andy byler
eugene bigelow writes: >doesn't the bible say that god is a fair god [sic]? if this is true, how can >this possibly be fair to the infants? what do you mean fair? god is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. as all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf romans 5.12, psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven. hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the god against whom they, with the whole of the human race except mary, have sinned. which is why jesus said, "truly, truly i say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and spirit" which is the true meaning of born again (john 3.5). thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from god and exlcuded from heaven. as st. augustine said, "i did not invent original sin, which the catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy."

now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays, so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish- speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language. in addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals. so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those meetings. as for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities. >has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action? the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of latin? indeed not! see my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article. however, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted. i'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping. >rather i believe it has been enhanced, for paul exhorts us to become as >one of them that we might reach them. thus, if a person or group of >people feel more comfortable "among their own", shall we not give them a >place where they can feel comfortable [with their heritage] and still >l[ove god?] {[my guess - aaron]} you have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't. yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality "christian" friendships outside your nationality (and your denomination). we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage. however, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples. >this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going about things in the wrong way. and names like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe, although not as much as before. i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite. i know that it's hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and i am working to make it happen. however, what might be a smaller step towards unity, would be taking the word "african" out of your denomination's name. then perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "methodist episcopal" part also, and simply be part of "the church". >with regard to inclusivity, i note tht your .sig emits from mit. as you >know, the 'tute is religiously and culturally diversified, and not >everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english, much >less american culture. what shall be the conduct of the campus churches >then: shall there be one church, for the sake of unity?

marida ignacio writes: still, the angel gabriel's greetings was: "hail mary, full of grace, the lord is with you. blessed art thou amongst women". even mary was confused about this greeting. there are various explanations for her reaction to the angel's greeting. one is that she grasped what the angel was getting at, that she was to be the mother of the messiah. and knew what this entailed, all the suffering. this gave her a moment's pause.
regarding the consequences of the original sin: catholics believe that what adam primarily lost by his sin, for himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace. this is basically a share in the divine life. take a rock and make it able to talk: what god does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. it makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature. this is the "everlasting life" that the new testament speaks of. what christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race. he instituted the sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered. the absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from heaven. the nature of heaven is such that it's impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace. to use my example, it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk. neither can human beings live in heaven without sanctifying grace. this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since both have souls. infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot enter into heaven. they too need this form of life in them, or they cannot enter into heaven. turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the catholic belief in sanctifying grace. unless baptism causes some change in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on the practice. yet infant baptism was probably practiced by the apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the church shortly thereafter. there is evidence for infant baptism in the new testament itself: 1 cor 1:16, acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also acts 11:14. it is known for sure that at least one disciple of the apostle john was baptized as an infant: st. polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his martyrdom). st. justin martyr mentions men and women baptized as infants. there is direct evidence in st. irenaeus's "against heresies", and in tertullian's "on baptism". all these so far mentioned are in the first 170 years after our lord's death. after that, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.
the following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as "de sacramentis", usually attributed to st. ambrose of milan, and the canon of the traditional catholic mass of the roman rite. the conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late 4th century. taken from "the mass of the western rites", by the right reverend dom fernand cabrol, abbot of farnborough, 1934, without permission. excerpted from chapter vi: the mass at rome, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. the paragraph at the end is from the book, not me. sorry about the long lines. joe buehler ----- text of de sacramentis roman canon roman canon (about 400 ad) (1962 ad) (english translation) te igitur ...

jek@cu.nih.gov () james kiefer writes: (stuff deleted) [first point. what they are doing is wrong, just as what joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what judas did was wrong. they intend it for evil. if god somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment. second point. of course, god will bring good out of it. but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.] so what you're saying then, is that god exercises direct control, or influence upon humanity. he doesn't control our every thought or action, but takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turns it into something good. it seems to me, that this idea conflicts with the belief that god gave humans free will. as far as i can determine, it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. if god were to exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be impeding upon someone's free will. unless, of course, you believe that god did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sort of conditional free will. something that allows us to make our own choices and control our own lives except when god wants to use us to fulfill some good purpose of his own by "hardening our heart" or controlling us in some other way. i hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly catastrophies or things like the aids epidemic and make comments about god's will. i have a very difficult time understanding why people believe that god controls anything that happens on this planet. except, possibly when being asked to through someone's prayer. according to the bible, pharoah was going to let moses' people go after one or two plagues, but god kept hardening his heart so moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the egyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children. so then, god impeded upon pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet. god did this not just to free the hebrews, but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion. i suppose from the hebrew's point of view, this could be seen as turning something bad into good, but i'm sure the egyptians didn't see it this way. all of your examples of how god turned something bad into something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over another. after all, it's only good based upon your point of view. why does god, who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity, play favorites?

woo! so far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of the `whore of babylon' in rev 17 & 18: a) the united states of america b) mho db) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who corrupt and oppress human society c) historical jerusalem d) historical rome dare i suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? how about * the prophecy reveals god's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * that god's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that city's special call, it still rejected god's grace at the decisive time (rev 11:8? - also isn't rev19:24 equally suggestive of rome as jerusalem?) * that the usofa is guilty of many of the crimes of rome/babylon (a) and is equally subject to god's judgement * that the good book(tm) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created. (b) clever, huh? (<-- flame here!) no need to argue at all! i think mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between rev 17/18 and rev 21/22 - the mortal jerusalem chosen by god but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation and the new jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by god's grace. eg details like rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf rev 22 the single stream in the new jersualem `the river of life flowing from the throne of god and of the lamb.' rex - didn't understand your post - what's the relevance of babylonian mystery religions to all this? please elaborate your ideas about ot & the book of rev? why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual' interpretation of rev? i'd mail, but i can't get thru: 	unknown or illegal user: reflex@fnal.fnal.gov something you're not telling us?
what is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal suffering? if it is biblical, please reference. here's my train of thought: if god is using the earth to manufacture heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain yield, and a certain amount of waste. the yield goes to heaven, and the waste is burned (destroyed) in hell. why is it necessary to punish the waste, rather than just destroy it? peace and joy, dale wyttenbach

"you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination. also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion." lev. 18:22-23. i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. i know of no new testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention, intercourse with animals. do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the bible condemns bestiality as a perversion, and if so, why? that is, what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful? could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently? can one be a christian zoophile? by the way, i myself am subject to sexual desires that i did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful, so please understand that i am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternative orientations". i do believe, however, that one should read the bible with an attitude of "what is the bible trying to say" and not "what do i want the bible to say." i choose not to give in to my "perverted" sexual desires because i believe the bible tries to tell me, whether i like it or not, that such things are sin. it is frustrating at times, and i have had days where it really got me down, but i don't blame god for this, i blame the sin itself. - mark [there's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote. both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that "homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute. that doesn't meant that i think all the biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things. i think your argument from fornication is circular. why is homosexuality wrong? because it's fornication. why is it fornication? because they're not married. why aren't they married? because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony. why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony? because homosexuality is wrong. in order to break the circle there's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong. --clh]

[on secrecy in lds ceremonies. --clh] i think christ summed it up quite nicely when he said something about "casting pearls before swine." why tell people things that are most sacred to you when all they will do with it is belittle it. you have to be little to belittle.
i hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net before, but i'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that "the assumption of mary" would be better phrased "our assumptions _about_ mary." in all the time i've been reading about mary on this group, i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, scriptural foundation. i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ's parents as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god's working, beyond doubt. but the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human desire. only christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even he knew temptation, albeit without submitting to it. i also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the holy parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god's grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being. i won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" mary, etc., since folks have told me otherwise about that, but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god's incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings. -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ .......... .. . . . . . university of nebraska - lincoln . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grace . . . . . . . . . . . . happens .

without quoting at length from the preceeding post, i'd just like to say that i find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with issues like the holocaust and bosnia that asserting that "god is punishing them." the activity of god is always _redemptive_, which means "restoring what has been lost, broken, or distorted." so, god does not _will_ the brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but is nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend, and redeeem. revdak@netcom.com

: you might want to re-think your attitude about the holocaust after : reading deuteronomy chapter 28. on the contrary, after the holocaust, i would be _very_ cautious about my interpretatoin of deuteronomy 28. not everything that happens is in accordance with god's will. (you might guess which side of the predestination issue i am on.) i will never _assume_ that evil is punishment by god, especially when i am speaking of the evil that falls on _someone else_. for my own life, i will work to discern the hand of god in the evil that befalls _me_. see the discussion earlier on luke 13. revdak@netcom.com (unreconstructed arminian)
hey folks, i'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before. i'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot: what morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? in normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your actions. but if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an oobe, it seems like a morality applies. now, there seem to be 3 alternatives: 1) dreams and oobes are totally mental phenomena. in this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts. 2) dreams and oobes have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') evidence for this is that often dreams and oobes are sometimes done in common by more than one person. a mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. in this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and oobes as does in waking life. 3) like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and oobe environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe different) moral laws apply there. so... there it is. is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative? respond by post or email. thanks very much *dt* ======================================================== .

*yawn* excuse me, i don't recall any portion of my post in which i called christians arrogant quote me, if i did. i do remember calling christianity "silly" and then following that up with information that i was nine years old when i thought that. i also said that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god's existence. i define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", btw. also, i subscribe to a.a as i mentioned and we see fundies of all types there, so in answer to your question: "no." finally, i'd hardly call christianity "beseiged" in this country. i seldom see christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having christian bumper stickers. i don't know for sure, of course, i only say i haven't seen it happening. what i have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people who claim to be christ's followers. i know that this sort of thing isn't practiced by the majority of christians, but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and i don't see comperable victimization of christians. >now i have a question for bob. why in the world would any self-respecting >atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group? the implication being that i am not self-respecting, of course. i'm not a student of psychology, btw, but i am a student of creative writing and linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. also, if the implications i see are improper, please let me know. i'm here because i'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be. did it occur to you that i _don't_ think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life? have you read my other posts here or did you see "atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve your respect? aw, geez. i'm sorry, i probably am getting my back up a little too high, here. it's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. i figure you should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to your question. now, the smoothed feather version: i seek all sorts of knowledge. that's why i came to my university. yes, i am looking at your religion (well, sorta, i have no idea what *kind* of christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view. i've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because i genuinely don't know the answers to them, but when i saw the question directed at atheists i figured i would answer. after all, you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), but without an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive. i'm hoping people really want to know and i was trying to show that i actually checked out several religions and i actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and i actually think about these things. instead, i'm still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken" people are atheist. 	try it from the flip side: i posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists. i offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. why are religions so successful? because there is so much suffering in the world, which "breaks" people. it's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another reason i'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies :). >i have a >difficult enough time keeping up with it, and i think i know something ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >about the subject. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything about christianity. probably jumping at shadows again, but i think my reaction is somewhat justified. after all, the first post suggested that atheists are "broken", hostile people. this post confirms that someone else believes it. > >bob reminds me of my roommate. in order to disbelieve atheism, he says ^^^^^^^^^^ >he will need to be proven wrong about it. well, he got me there. i am a strong atheist, because i feel that lack of evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies lack of existence. however, i haven't met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him. call me a "seeker" if you like, i don't. _weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. some atheists simply say "i don't believe in any god" rather than my position: "i believe that no god(s) exist." for the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve, because they don't actively believe in atheism. (if you think this is confusing, try figuring out the difference between protestants and methodists from an atheist point of view :). this is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in something (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). guess what? my atheism ends the moment i'm shown a proof of some god's existence. is that really too much to ask? >well, i don't even waste my time trying. well, i guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. why the supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) is it because you yourself are unconvinced? :) > i tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest. note that i can only speak for myself. if you find faith to be honest, show me how. i have been unable to reconcile it so far. maybe that's how i'm "broken"? i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it. if you accept that, you are of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think. all i ask for is proof of the assertion "god exists". logical or physical proofs only, please. then we'll discuss the nature of "god". >in response, he tells me he will say an "atheist's prayer" for me. prayer?! uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :) >good luck, bob. and, best regards. good luck to you, as well. and, again, i apologize if the inferences i made were inaccurate. >-- >randal lee nicholas mandock >catechist >gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu muppets and garlic toast forever, max (bob) muir [note that abbreviation of quoted pasages is not always the fault of the poster. i sometimes do it in order to get a posting by the 50% rule in inews. --clh]

the cited passages are covered in depth in a faq for this group. that particular faq (i've forgotten the author) discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support. perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the faq on this topic? btw, this issue, while dealt with before, is very timely. one of the major presbyterian churches in california (st. andrews -- a megachurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the synod, which covers all of southern ca and hawaii) until support for a pro-homosexual lobbying group (the lazarus project) is terminated. [this came from a news report on cnn yesterday -- corrections welcome.] 					tim [i think it's time for me to post the faq. this is an issue throughout the presbyterian church. on the other side, one of the major churches in cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders, and has ignored presbytery instructions not to do so. and the church in rochester where the judicial commission said they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an "evangelist". these situations, as well as the one you describe, do not appear to be stable. this will certainly be a major topic for the general assembly next month. if the church can't come up with a solution that will let people live with each other, i think we're end up with a split. clearly neither side wants that, but i think we'll get pushed into it by actions of both sides. --clh]

but now once at the consummation he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 27 and inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this comes judgement; 28 so christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him. the first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ's sacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind. rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his "christianity and reincarnation". the thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death. the "once" is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity of christ's deed. one thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that christ incarnates more than once. but the comparison to the human experience - die once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just "judgement". the word for judgement is "krisis". hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation. at this point, i would just emphasize again that the passages that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death. what should be considered seriously is that the bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the last day. if you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable. and there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as matthew 11:14 and john 9:2. we can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. but what i wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike hindu, buddhist and "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through christ; the resurrection of the body, and the last judgement. taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective. e.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things. not that i propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their creator and redeemer. there are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence. there are those who deeply believe that the things of which the bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with. but christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) could not bear yet. this idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process. the bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from genesis to revelation. now, salvation (healing) becomes, not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning. and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become its fulfullment. gerry palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

>if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the bible >ever say so. it never comes right and says "only people that know >right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised." this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. it assumes that if the bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something, then that must mean that you do need to do it. i know there's a specific term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. however, if it were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; if the bible doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be ok, which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question i've often pondered. if slavery is immoral (which i believe it is, can i assume that everyone else in this group does too?), why doesn't jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it? owning slaves was common practice back then. paul speaks about everything else that is immoral. he apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. why doesn't anyone mention slavery? if god's morals are eternal and don't change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today.

while this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of christianity gerry palo has made some comparisons to asian religious beliefs on this topic which have simplified the asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation. there are significant differences in the idea of karma among hindus, jains, buddhists (and even among the various buddhist traditions.) to refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally incorrect in the buddhist and jain traditions. karma is considered to be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape a person's predilections for future intention and action and produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite -- "reward" has nothing to do with it. both jainism and buddhism are atheistic so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments. karma is usually described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof. in fact "as you sow, so shall you reap" is found in the pali canon as i recall, the metaphor of natural growth is explicit. hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are i believe much more deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being theistically inclined. in point of fact, the theravadin buddhist tradition of southeast asia considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics of karma without the element of free will. also in eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth, which is essentially absent in western considerations. isn't origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among christian thinkers? what were his views, and how did he relate them to the christian scriptures? jack carroll

someone referred to my faq essay on homosexuality. since it hasn't been posted for some time (and i've modified it somewhat since the last time), i'm taking this opportunity to post it. there is another entry in the faq containing comments by some other contributors. they can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality. it contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than i give here, though primarily from a conservative point of view. ---------------------------- this posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and christians. this is a frequently asked question, so i do not post the question each time it occurs. rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion. it summarizes arguments for allowing christian homosexuality, since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it. the most common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can a christian justify being a homosexual, given what the bible says about it?" first, on the definition of 'homosexual'. many groups believe that there is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction to members of the same sex. this is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity. homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable. however in a lot of discussion, the term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex. this is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups. in this paper i'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex. i haven't heard of any biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate. i think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual. this is often called a 'homosexual orientation'. it is not known whether it is genetic or environmental. there is evidence suggesting each. the best evidence i've seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes. one of them is probably genetic. there are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual. the best-known is exodus international". the reports i've seen (and i haven't read the detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the presbyterian church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that these programs have very low success rates, and that there are questions about how real even the successes are. but there certainly are people who say they have converted. however this issue is not as important as it sounds. those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by god. the fact that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict. if it's wrong, it's wrong. it may affect how we deal with people though. if it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it. one more general background issue: it's common to quote a figure that 10% of the population is homosexual. i asked one of our experts where this came from. here's his response: kinsey (see below) is the source of the figure 10 percent. he defines sexuality by behavior, not by orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from zero (completely heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual). according to kinsey, one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty. ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually. that was in 1948. the percentages held true in a followup study done by the kinsey institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early 80s or so, by bell and weinberg, i believe. i can't put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online information for kinsey's own study as it appears in iris, the catalog at rutgers: author kinsey, alfred charles, 1894-1956. title sexual behavior in the human male [by] alfred c. kinsey. wardell b. pomeroy [and] clyde e. martin. publisher philadelphia, w. b. saunders co., 1948. descrip xv, 804 p. diagrs. 24 cm. notes "based on surveys made by members of the staff of indiana 	 university, and supported by the national research council's 	 committee for research on problems of sex by means of funds 	 contributed by the medical division of the rockefeller foundation." 	 * bibliography: p. 766-787. other aut pomeroy, wardell baxter, joint author. * martin, clyde eugene, 	 joint author. subjects sex. * u. s. -- moral conditions. lc card 48005195 this figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the recent newsweek coverstory "is this child gay?" (feb. 24, 1992). a journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes kinsey's study, but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook...... i've seen some objections to the kinsey's study, but not in enough detail to include here. (if someone would like to contribute another view, i'd be willing to include it.) most christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong. not all, however. a few denominations accept it. the metropolitan community churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals. however the united church of christ also allows it, and i think a couple of other groups may as well. the episcopal church seems to accept it some areas but not others. in churches that have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that accept it (even among southern baptists, though the number is probably only one or two congregations). but these are unusual -- few churches permit homosexual church leaders. how carefully they enforce this is another issue. i don't have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others. as to the arguments over the biblical and other issues, here's an attempt to summarize the issues: the most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been john boswell: "christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality", u chicago press, 1980. the argument against is pretty clear. there are several explicit laws in the ot, e.g. leviticus 20:13, and in rom 1 paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality. beyond these references, there are some debates. some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant. e.g. the sin which the inhabitants of sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults. (there's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the entities involved were angels.) it was particularly horrifying because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong. (this is probably the reason lot offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked.) if you look through a concordance for references to sodom elsewhere in the bible, you'll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin. there's a jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests. at any rate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong. i do not discuss leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most christians do not consider binding. so unless nt justification can be found, lev. alone would not settle the issue. the nt references are all in paul's letters. a number of the references from paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague. boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not mean homosexual. here's what he says: the two greek words that appear in the lists (i.e. i cor 6:9 and i tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and /arsenokoitai/. unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean. /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing. boswell suggests "wanton" as a likely equivalent. he also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the church, including greek-speaking christians, was that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has vanished only in the 20th cent., as that practice has come to be less frowned-upon. (he cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the catholic encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.) he translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general. a more technical meaning, suggested by the early latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual male prostitute", but in his view paul did not intend it so technically. for a more conservative view, i consulted gordon fee's commentary on i cor. he cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate. however boswell warns us that in greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior. given what boswell and fee say taken together, i suspect that the term is simply not very definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it isn't a general term for homosexuality. while fee argues against boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same. the big problem with it is that the word is almost never used. paul's writing is the first occurence. the fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and "f**k" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action. examples of compound words formed either way can be given. in theory it could refer to rapists, etc. it's dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that "goodbye" is a religious expression because it's based on "god by with ye". however since boswell, fee, and niv seem to agree on "homosexual male prostitute", that seems as good a guess as any. note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something which fee and boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation). in my opinion, the strongest nt reference to homosexuality is romans 1. boswell points out that rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods. one could argue that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual. however i find this argument somewhat forced, and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what paul meant. however i am not convinced that rom 1 is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for christians. what paul is describing in rom 1 is not homosexuality among christians -- it's homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness. despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, i'm sure paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex. given his description of their situation, i rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless. so yes, i do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality. but in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a specific feature of homosexuality. my overall view of the situation is the following: i think we have enough evidence to be confident that paul disapproved of homosexuality. rom 1 seems clear. while i cor 6:9 and i tim 1:10 are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases. on the other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject. rom 1 is really about idolatry. it refers to homosexuality in passing. the result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to scripture. for those who look to scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition. for those whose approach to the bible is more liberal, it is not surprising that they regard paul's negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the gospel. as readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described. there's not a lot i can do as moderator about such a situation. a number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above. however in fact i'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses. the real issue seems to rest on the question of whether paul's judgement should apply to modern homosexuality. one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with. he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong. he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act "straight" and fail, and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality, which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man. it is unfair to take paul's judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions. another is the following: in paul's time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that christians would not find acceptable. it was part of temple prostitution. among private citizens, it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves. i'm not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some reasons to think so. the ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner. it was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner. (this is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful. his customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.) this supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal. clearly christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children, slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners. (however fee's commentary on i cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way. thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far. homosexuality may have been discredited for jews by some of these associations, but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children.) some people have argued that aids is a judgement against homosexuality. i'd like to point out that aids is transmitted by promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual. someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for aids. note that there is good reason from paul's general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative, apart from any specific statements on homosexuality. i believe his use of the genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what god ordained. however the way paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally. i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one. paul's tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. for example, while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms. for another example, paul obviously would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) remain unmarried. yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication. i believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views paul expressed in rom 1. one may believe that homosexuality is not what god intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still conclude that at times we have to live with it. note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. this doesn't mean that christians can stop working when we are saved. the question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness. if you're willing to consider the latter approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it. the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. this is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality. if you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it. clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult. however these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality. (many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality. this includes aids. i take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to christian heterosexual relationships.) in the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow christians who are in this situation. i've also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for "conversion". (aside from the presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an faq that summarizes our readers' reports on this question.) the evidence is that long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles. the danger in advising christians to depend upon such a change is clear: when "conversion" doesn't happen, which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy. paul recognized (though in a different context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and i think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement. the practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality. maybe homosexuality isn't god's original ideal, but i can well imagine paul preferring to see people in long-term, committed christian relationships than promiscuity. as with work -- which genesis suggests wasn't part of god's original ideal either -- i think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god's love with each other. there's an issue of biblical interpretation underlying this discussion. the issue is that of "cultural relativism". that is, when paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time? conservative christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the bible becomes subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative? when looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism. there are a number of judgements in the new testament that even conservative christians consider to be relative. the following judgements are at least as clear in the bible as anything said on homosexuality: - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in 	the ot -- it's not in the nt, but i mention it here because 	until relatively recently the church did consider it binding 	on christians) - prohibition against swearing oaths - endorsement of slavery as an institution - judgement of tax collectors as sinner we do not regard these items as binding. in most cases, i believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism. briefly: - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific 	agrarian society that the bible was trying to build, 	but not to our market economy. - few people believe that american judicial oaths have the 	same characteristics as the kind of oaths jesus was 	concerned about - most people believe that paul was simply telling people 	how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as 	an institution - for people believe that the irs is morally equivalent to 	roman tax farming the point i'm trying to make is that before applying biblical prohibitions to the 20th cent., we need to look at whether the 20th cent. actions are the same. when christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. until fairly recently christians prohibited taking of interest, and many christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed. (indeed, slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between god and human beings -- christians are often called servants or slaves of god.) i am not trying to say that everything in the bible is culturally relative. rather, i'm trying to say that *some* things are, and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the bible, that ends the discussion. we need to look at whether the action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the bible was talking about. if christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding, i'm willing to listen. those who claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above). one thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates. when you consider the weakness of the biblical evidence -- some laws in leviticus, a passage in rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among christians seems rather out of proportion. this should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply biblical involved. this is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the biblical arguments as conservative christians are to find biblical arguments. but i can't help feeling that the bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources. this is a dangerous situation for christians. on the other side of the issue, i would like to note some problems i have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented. one of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined. i.e. "god made me homosexual", and i have no choice. i think "god made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable. but i don't see it as an argument for acceptability. many people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug addiction may turn out to be as well. that doesn't mean it's ok. most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong. some people get angry easily. others tend to be arrogant. others tend to be attraced to women who are married to someone else. homosexuality (if we view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these other things. if we are going to follow god, we all end up at one time or another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular temptations that cause us problems. none of us can sit back and say that because god made us the way we are we can just relax. as jesus said, we all have to take up our cross daily. this concept of dying to self (which also appears throughout paul's letters) seems to suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we are called on not to accept. paul's letters and the experience of christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and the battle against it is lifelong and difficult. the fact that homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's ok. maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self. but i'd like to make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle somewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all christians have to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.
it troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of original sin. this is primarily a catholic doctrine, with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism. even among, its supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell. it's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine. however, if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth. let's now take a more complete look at scripture. colossians 2:11-12 "in him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god, who raised him from the dead." in baptism, we are raised to a new life in christ (romans 6:4) through a personal faith in the power of god. our parent's faith cannot do this. do infants have faith? let's look at what the bible has to say about it. romans 10:16-17 "but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for isaiah says, 'lord, who has believed our message?' consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of christ." so then we receive god's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god's word preached. kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to god's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life. ezekiel 18:20 "the soul who sins will die. the son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." if you read all of ezekiel 18, you will see that god doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam. ezekiel 18:31-32 "rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted, and get a new heart and a new spirit. why will you die, o house of israel? for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the sovereign lord. repent and live!" the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit. kids cannot do this. acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we will then receive a new spirit, the holy spirit. then we shall live. now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it. romans 5:12 "therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--" sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned. death came to each man because each man sinned. note that it's good to read through all of romans 5:12-21. some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing. let's look at one such. romans 5:19 "for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous." through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner. in the same way, through the obedience of jesus, each will be made righteous. we must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from adam. otherwise the bible would contradict itself. i encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn't all fit together. psalm 51:5 "surely i was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sinning. david himself was a man after god's own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband. all that david is saying here is that he can't remember a time when he wasn't sinful. he is humbling himself before god by confessing his sinfulness. his saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole. the bible, being inspired by god, isn't limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did jesus (john 16:25). for another example of hyperbole, see luke 14:26. now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc. certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling is always that they don't know any better. let's look to see if the bible agrees with my gut feelings. isaiah 7:14-15 "therefore the lord himself will give you a sign: the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him immanuel. he will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right." now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about jesus. if they don't, then point them to matthew 1:23 and find a new leader. jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human babies. yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong. we see that he did grow and become wiser in luke 2:40 and 2:52. the implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong. since we know that jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose the right instead of the wrong. jesus himself was baptized, albeit with john's baptism, not as an infant, but as a thirty-year-old man (luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized (luke 3:23). immediately afterwards, he was tempted by the devil (luke 4:1-13; matthew 4:1-11; mark 1:12-13). thank you for your attention. moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while. perhaps you would like to make a faq out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up. feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final faq. sincerely, aaron cardenas aaronc@athena.mit.edu [i think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your response. first, original sin is not a catholic-only doctrine. it was held by luther and calvin as well, and is still present in one form or another in the lutheran and reformed traditions. second, saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it. the original baptist theology included original sin, and some baptists still hold it. and there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original sin. among protestants, the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among catholics. protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of god's acceptance of us, rather than our acceptance of god. in traditional protestant theology, god's grace precedes our response, and is applicable to children. there are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that god accepts even children. --clh]

[note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together. first, your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one. (in this group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.) you seem to be suggesting the jesus is god's son in a physical sense, with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother. i consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently. the virgin birth says that jesus' birth is god's responsibility. but it doesn't imply that god's sperm was involved. indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that god used joseph's genetic material. second, jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father. in a trinitarian context, the term son refers to the eternal logos, who is a part of god. the son didn't come into existence with jesus' birth. jesus is the incarnation of the son. so his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated. rather, it's the son who was incarnated. --clh]
>there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion, clearly makes >a positive inference to reincarnation. i don't remember which one it is off of >the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: jesus is talking with the >apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can >come elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come, but they did >not recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering >to john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus` time, that elijah would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die). however jesus was referring to john the baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john (remember elijah didn`t die) but that john was a similar prophet to elijah. john was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through israel preaching the coming kingdom. the verses that describe him (in mark`s gospel) can be linked to ot references about elijah. hence john was similar to elijah and jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the suffering servant in isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself. a brief reply but i don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff. suffice to say there is a very strong explanation. rick. ________________________________________________________________ richard johnston queen`s university 73 malone road belfast belfast northern ireland bt9 6sb u9245669@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk ________________________________________________________________
from: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (d. andrew byler) >does anyone now where an english translation of the long recension of >the acts of the apostles can be found? 1] an english translation of this can be found in: "the acts of the apostles, translated from the codex bezae, with an introduction on its lucan origin and importance", j. m. wilson (london, 1923). 2] another work that might be useful is: "the acts of the apostles, a critical edition with introduction and notes on selected passages", albert c. clark (oxford, 1933; reprinted 1970). (this is an edition of text of acts that makes the assumption that the text in codex bezae is the more authentic. i don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: "the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in acts", eldon j epp (cambridge, 1966). 4] the most recent reference i found was an edition in french from the early '80s. (i can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find. so if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: "a textual commentary on the greek nt", bruce metzger (united bible society, 1971). metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of the greek nt. it contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the ubs3. furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in atcotgnt (the majority of these occur in acts). in particular in the introduction to the section on acts metzger writes: "[an attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an english translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by western witnesses ... since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). >i understand that one of the early codexes, vaticanus and siniaticus has >this version of acts. it would be interesting to know what the >differences are between the long and the short forms. 6] most of the copies of the text of acts that we have (including the ones in vaticanus and siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or alexandrian) version. the longer version to which you refer is usually called the "western" version and its main witness is the codex bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] as far as size, the difference is that in clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by westcott and hort (a typical alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] to answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. the main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the alexandrian). the western text seems to be given to more detail. there are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy. if there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not. n

heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance. the most beautiful virtues this story is an excerpt taken from the basket of flowers by johann christoph von schmid in a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there lived an upright	and intelligent man named jacob rede. he was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val- ley. after living many, happy years together, jacob's wife	died, leaving him alone with only one friend...his daughter mary. even as a child mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in years, her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm. her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness, that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel. mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour- ite flowers were the violet, the lily and the rose. jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender. when	she once, early in march brought the first violet to him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said: let the modest violet, my dear mary, be to you an image of humil- ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret. it clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to bloom in retired grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain- ing hidden beneath the leaves. may you also, my dear mary, be like the retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to attract the public	eye, but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace. one morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array, jacob said to his daughter, as he pointed out a beautiful lily, which	was beaming in the morning sun: let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem of purity. look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! the whi- test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals: they are like the snow. happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain. but the purest of all colours is also the hardest 				 -5- to preserve pure. easily is the petal of the lily soiled;	touch it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind. in the same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence! then pointing to a rose he said: let the rose my dear mary, be to you an emblem of modesty. more beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl. it is a sign that she is still pure of	heart and innocent in thought. happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to blush, as	she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger. the cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue, while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and	wan, and go before their time to the grave." among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others. it was an apple tree, not much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in the middle of	the garden. mary's father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. once it blossomed earlier	than usual and with unusual luxuriance. the tree was one mass of blossom. mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it. once, when it was in full bloom, she called to her father and said: look father, how beautiful! was there ever such a lovely mingling of	red and white? the whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers! the next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more	upon the tree. but what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. they were all become brown and	yellow	and when the	sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground. mary wept bitter tears at the sight. then said the father: thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth. oh my child, never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right! behold in the example of the apple tree an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way - if the hopes your conduct hitherto has	raised	in my	heart should vanish, not merely for a day or year, but for life. ah, then how much more bitter would be the tears which i would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks! life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes i should 				 -6- go down sorrowfully to my grave. as he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; mary was deeply moved, and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them. under the eyes of a father so loving and	wise, and amid the flowers of her garden, mary grew daily in stature and intelli- gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a lily and retiring	as a violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom. happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of	his garden rewarded his diligent toil; but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example. jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in a bunch and gave them to mary with the words: the lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one to	the other; both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren- dered still more lovely by being together. in the	same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and cannot be separated the greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought of the presence of god -- internet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au viva cristo rey !! long live christ the king.
"hate the sin but love the sinner"...i've heard that quite a bit recently, often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isn't that important. my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity. i would think not. hate begets more hate, never love. consider some sin. i'll leave it unnamed since i don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin. now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. if we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the stronger our hatred of it will become. eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. in addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin). after enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). hate builds up and drives people away from god...this certainly cannot be a good way to build love. in the summary of the law, christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors. he doesn't say anything about hate. in fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. so, how are christians supposed to deal with the sin of others? i suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. we need to ask god to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love with theirs. only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. the best way to love someone is to pray for them. - scott -- this is my signature. there are many like it, but this one is mine. scott holt 		internet: scott@prism.gatech.edu georgia tech 				uucp: ..!gatech!prism!scott office of information technology, technical services

(some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.) in situations where welfare assistance is provided through our church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the gospel standards and provide for themselves. however, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. as a former bishop of mine said, "children are always worthy before god." >i'm especially >keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on >bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical >book the mormons keep in salt lake city. i am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards" in this context. latter-day saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity. if you use genealogical material or software produced by the church, you may notice a section for "temple ordinances." within that section there should be a spot for signifying "bic" which stands for "born in the covenant." the children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are "born in the covenant" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity. supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents). >if this is an issue on which the >"official" position has changed over time, i'm interested in learning both old >and new beliefs. e-mail or posting is fine. all information or pointers are >appreciated. i can't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances, but it has been accepted for the ~15 years i have been in the church. i would tend to discount any admonitions from the church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the lord's plan to recover what we have done wrong the church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure. a idler

i have enrolled in "the history of christianity" at a college here in st. louis. the teacher of the class is what i consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of christianity is. his definition is tied directly to that of the trinity and the catholic church's definition of it and belief in jesus christ is not sufficient to call one's self a christian. while his saying it doesn't make it so, i nevertheless feel insulted (or am i just neurotic? :^) ). i would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship. so, is there common definition of what christianity is? as the previous discussion of the trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames, i am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames. regards, -- larry autry silicon graphics, st. louis autry@sgi.com [often we get into discussions about who is christian. unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions. starting from the broadest, commonly used definitions are: a historical definition people who accept christ as lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definitions 1) by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use. this would include any group that developed out of the christian church, and continues within the same broad culture. e.g. some unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with. yet it's clear that that group developed from christianity, and people from very different backgrounds (e.g. hindus) would likely see them as part of christianity. this is not a definition most christians like, but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts. 2) accepting christ as lord and savior is a test used by many christian groups for membership, e.g. the southern baptists and presbyterian church (usa). i would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to christ, so that someone who accepted christ as one of many gods would not fit. it's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine. by this definition, groups such as arians would be viewed as heretical christians, but still christians. in the modern context this would include mormons, jw's, and "oneness pentecostals". they would be viewed as heretical christians, but still christian. in practice i believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the apostle's creed. 3) the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition, which includes all of the major strands of christianity, but excludes groups that are felt to be outside "historic christianity." this is of course a slippery enterprise, since catholics could argue that protestants are outside historic christianity, etc. but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon. the attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of christianity agree are key. obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement. a mormon will regard the lds church as a major strand, and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs. but i think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance. 4) finally, some people use definitions that i would say are limited to a specific christian tradition. e.g. some evangelicals only consider someone christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience, and some i've even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church. i think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used. a lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for. if you're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll probably use definition 1 or 2. if you're using it normatively, i.e. to say what you believe the christian message is, you'll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4. --clh]

andy byler writes on the biblical basis for the dogma of the immaculate conception: + i will put enmity between you [the serpent] and the woman, and + between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall + crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel. + -genesis 3.15 + he who commits sin is of the devil ... -1 john 3.8 + hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the lord is with + thee ... -luke 1.28 in the hebrew of genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine. + he shall crush your head, and you shall bruise his heel. the latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar. andrew stated that kecharitomene means not just "full of grace" but "having a plenitude or perfection of grace." the word is used elsewhere in the new testament only in ephesians 1:6 + unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath + graced us in his beloved son. (rheims-douay translation) i cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies anything as strong as andrew suggests, nor does the ephesians passage suggest that the verb means "to preserve from any taint of original or actual sin from the first moment of existence." i should like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not from s writer who is discussing luke 1:28 at the moment. yours, james kiefer

gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives. i wrote that the apostle paul, in romans 9, speaks of god as choosing jacob over esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet. clearly, paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. for if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born." daniel cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for god to hate easau when esau has done nothing bad? i reply that in hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. as an example, consider the saying in matthew 6:24 + no man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one + and love the other, or.... now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. but it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. a dog that always comes when either billy or bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. it cannot give first priority to both. one must take second place. in our original example, second place means that jacob, not esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of christ. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** eugene bigelow mentions matthew 11:14 which says of john the baptist: + and if ye will receive it, this is elijah, who was to come. i take this to mean that john was an elijah-like figure, dressing and living like elijah, preaching like elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that elijah would prepare the way for the messiah. i do not think that he was elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (john 1:21). yours, james kiefer
this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the "johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of taize (pronounced te-zay) in france. name of proposed newsgroup: ========================== soc.religion.taize (unmoderated) purpose of the group: ==================== the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in france. many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others. this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly "johannine hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each month. a "johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given bible passage, followed by some questions for reflection. any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here. we are not interested in theological debate, and even less in polemics. no expertise is required! the idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own life-journey. the idea of "johannine hours" was born in taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible's message in the midst of their daily life. because of work or studies, it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. there, in silence, we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ. during the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if, in some biblical expressions, we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ. the idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of christ, not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply. perhaps those who read and think about the "johannine hours" in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others. the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing, which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network. background of the taize community: ================================= the following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the taize (pronounced te-zay) community. "a parable of communion": august 1940, with europe in the grip of world war ii, brother roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost abandoned village of taize, in eastern france. his dream: to bring together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time. centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal refugees, especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation. an international and ecumenical community: taize's founder spent the first two years alone. others joined him later and at easter 1949, seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy. year by year, still others have entered the community, each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation. today, there are 90 brothers, catholics and from various protestant backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia, africa, north and south america. the brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no capital. the brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work. in 1966, sisters of saint andrew, an international catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming people in taize. taize and the young; the intercontinental meetings: young adults, and less young, have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since 1957. hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search. intercontinental meetings take place each week, sunday to sunday, throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week. the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity. the meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week. three times every day, the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church of reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too small. "a pilgrimage of trust on earth" the community has never wanted to create a "movement" around itself. instead, people are called to commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood, their city or village. to support them in this, taize has created what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". at the end of each year, the pilgrimage has a "european meeting" which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for several days in a major city. there have also been meetings in asia and in the united states. every year, brother roger writes an open letter to the young. usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year. note: discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news.groups. for any further information contact: brother.roy@almac.co.uk brother.roy@almac.co.uk -- . 1st 1.10b #332 . taize-community, 71250 taize, france
edgar pearlstein asks (fri 7 may 1993) whether the supreme court, or any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of religion. the universal military training and service act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. it defined "r t & b" as "an individual's belief in a relation to a supreme being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." in the 1965 case of united states v. seeger, the supreme court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit theists. justice tom clark, delivering the court's opinion, said: we have concluded that congress, in using the expression "supreme being" rather than the designation "god," .... the test of belief "in a relation to a superme being" is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in god of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a supreme being" and the other is not...." my immediate reference is the first freedom, by nat hentoff, (delacorte 1980, dell 1981). yours, james kiefer

"khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. the babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems. this was the way in which osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than nimrod. it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of osiris. but what could have led to the union of a masonic body with these mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building? now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, egypt stood to babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the masonic art? the strong presumption is, that nimrod must have been the man. he was the first that gained faim in this way. as the child of the babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of ala mahozim, 'the god of fortification.' osiris, the child of the egyptian modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.' this strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in egypt with every physicall characteristic of nimrod. i have already noticed the fact that nimrod, as the son of cush, was a negro. now, there was a tradition in egypt, recorded by plutarch, that 'osiris was black'......." hislop it was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin. i mean real leopard skin. he told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin. (the reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!) nimr-rod from nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "to subdue." it is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves. any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard. it is interesting that the druids of britian also show, or should i say hide, this representation. they, however, worshipped the "spotted cow". i'll stand by my statements. masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all find their source in babylon, the great harlot. sorry peter, i do not mean to be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that masonry doesn't find its origins in egypt. of the masons i have personally talked to, all refered to egypt as their origin. why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted? -rex

(david hammerslag) writes: >this paragraph brought to mind a question. how do you (mormons) reconcile >the idea of eternal marriage with christ's statement that in the ressurection >people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. 20)? well, here is something i wrote some time ago in response to a similar question. i hope it helps: [begin repeat of previous post] as for the scripture mentioned i agree that it does seem to be a problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general. luke's version has jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven. it almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation. (matthew and mark both omit this statement.) i think the accounts are not as clear as they might be. let's have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means. the scriptures involved are mat 22:23-30, mark 12:18-25, and luke 20:27-36. what happened was that the sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, thought they could trap jesus. they made reference to the "leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children. the children would be considered children of the deceased, just as though the woman's first husband had fathered them. it seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband. however, the sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow. they seem to imply that the leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask, "whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?" at this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody's wife, it is the first husband. after all, had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father. it is possible jesus was refering to this when he says, "ye do err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of god." (mat 22:29, compare mark 12:24, phrase not in luke's account). anyway, the sadducees ask, "whose wife will she be in the resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?" jesus answer is that, "in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage..." (mat 22:30) "when they rise from the dead they neither marry..." (mark 12:25) "they which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry..." (luke 20:35) all 3 accounts go on to say, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent. i find this last not very helpful since the bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like. (some ministers claim that they are sexless, different that humans etc. but i can find no biblical support for this.) i think what jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in matthew's and mark's accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection. this goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth. however, we do believe that a marriage performed by the authority of god can be binding in eternity. in fact, the first marriage appears to have been performed by god himself before death entered the world (in the garden of eden). what therefore god hath joined together, let not man put asunder. (mat 19:6) jesus also told peter and the other apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven (mat 16:19, 18:18). i believe that this also refers to marriages performed by the proper authority.

i wrote that i thought that 2 peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of scripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is merely the private opinion of the writer." tony zamora replies (sat 8 may 1993) that this in turn implies that it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either. i am not sure that i understand this. in one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation. if reliable historians tell me that the athenians lost the pelopennesian war, i cannot simply interpret this away because i wanted the athenians to win. facts are facts and do not go away because i want them to be otherwise. in another sense, every statement is subject to private interpretation, in that i have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent. even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing, i still have to decide, using my own best judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. this is not arrogance -- it is just an inescapable fact. yours, james kiefer

>[there's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage >you quote. both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that >"homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to >have a meaning like homosexual prostitute. from what i understand of my experience in looking up this word, and discussing it with a greek-literate individual, the meaning of the word is rather clear. basically it literally means "he who beds with a man" or "he who has sex with a man." the burden of proof is on the pro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning. one can speculate all day long that it might mean something else, but we need evidence before we create new doctrines, and get rid of the historical understanding of the meaning of this word. link hudson.

"god, thank you for making me the way you did. i know that you never do anything second best. yet with all that you have given me, i have been so unthankful. you've given me power to resist the devil. i have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do. i have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so. lord, with all you've given me, i have been completely unfaithful and i do not deserve your forgiveness. and, yet your love for me is so boundless that you would give yourself to die for me to save me. as terribly evil as i am, i deserve to go straight to hell, yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life i've led. lord, please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring glory to your name instead of insult. lord i'm so sorry for my wrongs. please help me to change." : : i think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they don't want to be wrong. if i find someone arrogant, i typically : don't have anything to do with them. for me, i've often found it hard to tell the difference. often times, the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company. when i'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, i certainly don't feel like being confronted by my wrongness. were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness, i'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me. at the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about living my life arrogantly as i wish. however, were someone to confront me silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private, i'd feel broken down and challenged to seek god for help in changing from the error of my ways. the hard part is getting to the point to where i can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not. it isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one's ability to serve god. it's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering god's creation in our lives instead. : but we should examine ourselves [i hope i typed this back in right] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions. for instance, : many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person. as if : we needed a reason to feel insulted. but after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult. just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that : reaction the appropriate one. it is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions. : sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character. the devil is the accuser of the bretheren. he would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong. the devil's aim is to get us into as much misery as he can. just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons. the way the devil gets under the father's skin is by hurting those that the father loves so much. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 	"i deplore the horrible crime of child murder... 	 we want prevention, not merely punishment. 	 we must reach the root of the evil... 	 it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt 	 from the dreadful deed... 	 no mater what the motive, love of ease, 		or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, 		the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed... 	 but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her 		to the desperation which impelled her to the crime." 		- susan b. anthony, 		 the revolution july 8, 1869

before you finalize your file in the faqs (or after), you might want to correct the typo in the following: > kinsey (see below) is the source > of the figure 10 percent. he defines sexuality by behavior, not by > orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from zero (completely > heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual). it seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with "homosexual". as a personal note, i guess i differ with you on the question of work entering human life as a result of sin. > note that in the > creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. before the fall (gen 2:15) "and the lord god took the man, and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it." which i would call "work". for me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added at the fall (i take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the work for sustenance). in a way, some view "work" as a blessing (ecclesiastes is a fun book! - for melancholies). i hope i do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further. well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and i guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose "it summarizes arguments for allowing christian homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a faq. i wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define). > the danger in advising christians to > depend upon such a change is clear: when "conversion" doesn't happen, > which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling > excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement > of life-long celibacy. perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid heterosexual. could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it was worth"? [this depends upon the person. in some cases i think the answer is no. even with those who could, consider what you're asking. i assume we're talking about marriage -- i certainly would not want to suggest sex outside that. you're talking about a permanent commitment to a kind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can live with. there may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but i wonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner. i have a cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation. we found out later (after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexual identity. his family (conservative christians) knew it, and pushed him into getting married. he continued having problems, and they were near divorce. she died in an accident whose circumstances some of the relatives consider odd. he has since had a sex change operation, and has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold a job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of grandparents consider irresponsible. i hope you can understand why i am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage. i really liked my cousin. this is sort of an emotional issue for me. again, it may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation that needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed ideology. --clh]

"in the western church the canon of both testaments was closed at the end of the fourth century through the authority of jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the principle of tradition), and more especially of augustine, who firmly followed the alexandrian canon of the septuagint, and the preponderant tradition in reference to the catholic epistles and the revelation; though he himself, in some places, inclines to consider the old testament apocrypha as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority." this history goes on to say that augustine attended both the council of hippo and of carthage. it is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to the fourth session of the council of trent. the footnote lists various synods which endorsed lists of canonical books, but then says "the tridentine list or decree was the first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration on the canon of the holy scriptures." which leads one to think that the rc canon was not official until trent. thus my previous erroneous statement was not entirely groundless. it is also interesting to note that the council of trent went on to uphold "the old latin vulgate edition" of the scriptures as authentic. which, i would suppose, today's catholic scholars wish the council had never said. also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical and canonical books--in contrast to (eerdman's statement of) the fourth century views. david wagner a confessional lutheran
i recently came across this article which i found interesting. i have posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue. i realise it is rather long (12 pages in wordperfect) by may well be worth the read. except for the first page (which i typed) the rest was scanned inusing omnipage. some of the f's have come out as t's and visa-versa. i have tried to correct as much as possible. about the author peter hammond is the founder of frontline fellowship, a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in southern africa. he has also made several visits to many east european countries. frontline fellowship news issn 1018-144x praying for justice (by peter hammond) to those involved in ministering to christians suffering persecution the imprecatory psalms are a tremendous source of comfort. and those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon god has entrusted to us in the imprecatory psalms. the imprecatory psalms early in my christian walk i encountered the prayers for judgement in the psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them. prayers such as: "break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for his wickedness ..." psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which i had accepted. yet psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for god ("the lord is king for ever and ever; the nation will perish from his land" 10:16, and "why does the wicked man revile god? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who suffer ("you hear, o lord, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more." 10:17-18) nevertheless, i grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for god to judge the wicked as: "pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "o lord, the god avenges, o god who avenges, shine forth. rise up, o judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve." 95:1-2; "break the teeth in their mouths, o god; ...let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... the righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. then men will way, "surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a god who judges the earth.'" 58:6-11 certainly i wanted god to be honoured and yes i was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil - but could i actually pray for god to "pour out his wrath" on the wicked? the scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies. rather they are to be prayed in christ, for his glory and against his enemies. the psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil" and "are a disgrace in the eyes of god. your tongue plots destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise deceit. you love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth." 52:1-3; "they crush your people ... they slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5- 6; "with cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish." 83:3; "you hate all who do wrong. you destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the lord abhors." 5:5-6. to those unrepentant enemies of god the psalmist declares: "surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5; "surely god will crush the heads of his enemies ... of those who go on in their sins" 68:21. and the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "then it will be known to the ends of the earth that god rules ..." 59:13; "to proclaim the powers of god" 68:34; "all kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him " 72:11; "who knows the power of your anger? for your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you. " 90:11 yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 psalms include imprecations (prayers invoking god's righteous judgement upon the wicked) such prayers are rare in the average western church. however, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common. praying against the persecutors amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of marxist angola i found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for god to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the church. i was shocked - yet it was biblical (even the martyrs in heaven pray "how long, sovereign lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" revelation 6:10). the initiator of the communist persecution in angola was agestino neto. described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", neto had been installed by cuban troops as the first dictator of angola. he boasted that: "within 20 years there won't be a bible or a church left in angola. i will have eradicated christianity." yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not christianity that was eradicated in angola but agestino neto. neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in moscow. in romania i learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of god judging the persecutors of the church in answer to prayer: * a communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack. * another communist party official ordered that all the bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be turned into toilet paper. this blasphemous project was in fact carried out. but the next day when the official was medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal cancer. he died shortly afterwards. * on another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day. * when an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order. at gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church. in desperation, the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to dismantle the structure. yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local christians to pray for him, that god would not judge him. he emphasised that he had nothing against christians and was only obeying strict orders. the building was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship. "they were all seized with sear and the name of the lord jesus was held in high honour... in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power. " acts 19:17,20 nicolae ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "the antichrist is dead" in the streets. many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of romania. another persecutor of the church who challenged god was samora machel, the first dictator of marxist mozambique. samora machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960's. he pledged his soul to satan and vowed that he would destroy the church and turn mozambique into the first truly marxist-leninist state in africa. thousands of churches in mozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained and padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. missionaries were expelled, some being imprisoned first. evangelism was forbidden. bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of christians, including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again. a month before his sudden death samora machel cursed god publicly and challenged him to prove his existence by striking him (machel) dead. on 19 october 1986, while several churches were specifically praying for god to stop the persecution in mozambique, machel's soviet tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm. the plane crashed 200 metres within south africa's boundary with mozambique. amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of malawi were discovered and published. not only had god judged a blasphemer and a persecutor, but he had also saved a country from persecution. in the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor god to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of kenneth kaunda. this was done on 31st october 1991 when fredrick chiluba (a man converted to christ whilst imprisoned for opposing kaunda) was elected president of zambia and covenanted to make zambia a christian country. it is recorded in history that the wicked mary, queen of scots, declared trembling and in tears: "i am more afraid of john knox's prayers than of an army of ten thousand". on 3 april 1993 the secretary general of the south african communist party chris hani was shot dead. from the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr. certainly it was not the death and resurrection of christ jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of south africa this easter, but the assassination of chris hani. the stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in south africa in 1992, yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the sa communist party than for all the thousands of other victims. indeed the sa government, the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 south africans murdered since 2nd february 1990 when the anc, sacp and pac were unbanned! yet as a member of the anc revolutionary council since 1973, deputy commander of umkhonto we sizwe (mk) the anc's "military wing" - from 1982, and chief of staff of mk from 1987, chris hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians. as jesus warned: "all who live by the sword will die by the sword " matt 26:52. after personally confronting hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in washington dc (where he publicly declared his support for fidel castro, col. gaddafi, yasser arafat and saddam hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") i told him that i was a christian and, while i didn't hate him, i did hate communism and i was praying for him - that god would either bring him to repentance and salvation in christ, or that god would remove him. he responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist. several other people also prayed that god would either bring hani to repentance or remove him. similarly several churches in america have begun to pray the imprecatory psalms against unrepentant abortionists. in one town 8 abortionists were struck down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer, within months of these public prayers for god to stop these killers of preborn babies. some praised god for his righteous acts of judgement and quoted: "when justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers " proverbs 21:15. others were shocked that any christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked. yet the apostles prayed imprecatory prayers (acts 13:8-12; galatians 1:8-9; 2 tim 4:14-15) and so did our lord (matt 11:20-24). what then should our attitude towards the imprecatory psalms be? should we be praying the psalms? to tackle these thorny issues i would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "war psalms of the prince of peace - lessons from the imprecatory psalms" by james e adams, (published by the presbyterian and reformed publishing company): our lord jesus christ & his apostles used the psalms constantly in teaching men to know god. the new testament (nt) quotes the old testament (ot) over 283 times. 41% of all ot quotes in the nt are from the psalms. christ himself alluded to the psalms over 50 times. the psalms are the prayer book of the bible. 1. are the imprecatory psalms the oracles of god? some christian commentators & theologians reject these psalms as "devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "not god 's pronouncements of his wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of jesus' teaching that we should love our enemies. " yet 2 tim 3:16-17 declares: "all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. " (see also 2 peter 3:15-16). the fact that something in the word of god is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration. to make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of god. do we imagine ourselves to be holier than god? wrong ideas of god have led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to "clean up" god's word according to their own ideas of what is proper. they have forgotten that it is god alone who must determine what christianity is and what is suitable for his church. the essence of what many have done is to question the authority of god's word (like eve's original sin of listening to satan's question "yes, hath god said... ?"). the psalms are part of god's revelation of himself and his attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the nt as the authoritative word of god. those imprecatory psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy" for the church are the very psalms christ used to testify about himself (eg: mark 12:36; matt 22:43-44) and which the apostles used as authoritative scripture (eg: acts 1:16-20; acts 4:25; heb 4:7). see also: 2 samuel 23:1-2. ch spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory psalms, (especially ps 109): "truly this is one of the hard places of scripture, a passage which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the lord would speak to us therein. " the rejection of any part of god's word is a rejection of the giver of that word, god himself. 2. who is praying these psalms? christ quoted the psalms not merely as prophesy; he actually spoke the psalms as his own words. the psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our lord. he used it as his prayer book and song book - from the synagogue to the festivals and at the last supper. on the cross christ quoted from the psalms - not as some ancient authority that he adapted for his own use, but as his very own words - the words of the lord's anointed - which as david's son he truly was. "father, into your hands i commit my spirit" ps 31:5 "my god, my god, why have you forsaken me?" ps 22:1 in his ministry christ foretells what he will say as the judge on the day of judgement, and he quotes the psalms in doing so! matt 7:23 "then i will tell them plainly, 'i never knew you. away from me, you evildoers'. " ps 6:8 in heb 10:5 the apostle attributes ps 40:6-8 directly to christ although nowhere in the gospels is christ recorded as having said these words. similarly hebrews 2 : 12 attributes ps 22:22 directly to christ despite there being no record of his having spoken these words while on earth. clearly the apostles believed christ is speaking in the psalms. christ came to establish his kingdom and to extend his mercy in all the earth. but let us never forget that jesus will come again to execute judgement on the wicked. david as the anointed king of the chosen people of god was a prototype of jesus christ. acts 2:30: "being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of christ. " david was a witness to christ in his office, in his lite, and in his words. the same words which david spoke, the future messiah spoke through him. the prayers of david were prayed also by christ. or better christ himself prayed these psalms through his forerunner david. the imprecatory psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of god, of his indignation against wrong doing, and his compassion for the wronged. 3. but what about the psalms of repentance? christ is also the lamb of god, the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins. christ in the day of his crucifixion was charged with the sin of his people. he appropriated to himself those debts for which he had made himself responsible. our lord was the substitution for the sinner. he took the sinners place (isaiah 53). "god made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of god. " 2 cor 5:21 in history the psalms, especially the imprecatory psalms, have been understood to have been the prayers of christ by: st augustine, jerome, ambrose, tertullian, luther and many others. all the psalms are the voice of christ. christ is praying the imprecatory psalms! all the psalms are messianic. it is the lord jesus christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. it is only right for the righteous king of peace to ask god to destroy his enemies. these prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of king jesus. his prayers will be answered! god's word is revealed upon all who oppose christ. anyone who rejects god's way of forgiveness in the cross of christ will bear the dreadful curses of god. he who prays psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when he declares to those on his left: "depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. " matt 25:41 all the enemies of the lord need to hear these psalms. *god's kingdom is at war.* the powers of evil will tall and god alone will reign forever! "with justice he judges and makes war...out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. he will rule them with an iron sceptre; he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty...king of kings and lord of lords. " rev 19 : 15 4. are jesus' prayers contradictory? what about jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us (matt 5:44)? christ is of course the loving and merciful saviour who forgives sin; but he is also the awesome judge who is coming in judgement on those who disobey his gospel. "god is just. he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled...this will happen when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. he will punish those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus. they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. " 2 thess 1:6-10 jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and he has power on earth to execute judgement upon his enemies. in the psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot god. even in the n.t. & in the gospels we see imprecations. "woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! you brood of vipers! how will you escape being condemned to hell ? " matt 23 in matt 26:23-24 christ quotes from ps 69 and 109 to refer to his betrayal by judas. we also need to acknowledge that christ's prayers of blessing are not for all. in john 17:6-9 it is clear that christ is only praying to the elect of god - those who have: "obeyed your word"... "accepted" god's word ... and have "believed ". (see luke 10:8-16 - those who reject the message of god's kingdom will be judged.) 5. may we pray the imprecatory psalms? martin luther pointed out that when one prays: "hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done " then "he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say: 'curses, maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. may they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground' . " to pray tor the extension of god's kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: dan 2:44: "the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. " * advance and victory for the church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness. * there is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. the church cannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for god's kingdom. god's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being destroyed. god's will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil. the glory of god demands the destruction of evil. instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of god. note psalm 83 where the psalmist prays against those who "plot together" against god and his people: "cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name o lord... do to them as you did to midian, as you did to sisera and jabin at the river kishon, who perished at endor and became like refuse on the ground. " the story of sisera in the book of judges (chapter 4 and 5) provides a vivid example of god's judgement on the wicked. sisera "cruelly oppressed the israelites for twenty years" and they "cried to the lord for help" judges 4:3. in response to those prayers: "the lord routed sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot... all the troops of sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. " judges 4:15-16 the account then goes on to describe how sisera escaped to the tent of jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. the song of victory by deborah and barak celebrated the crushing of the head of sisera in graphic detail (judges 5:25-27). and it is this that psalm 83 implores god to again do to his enemies.. "as you did to sisera ..." 6. the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience the imprecatory psalms are fully consistent with the law of god: "if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name - the lord your god - the lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. he will bring upon you all the diseases of egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. the lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this book of the law until you are destroyed...because you did not obey the lord your god ... so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. " deuteronomy 28:58-63 the covenant god made with his people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account: "the levites shall recite to all the people of israel in a loud voice: "cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and sets it up in secret. " then all the people shall say, "amen!" " "cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother... "cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone... "cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads... "cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow... "cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly... "cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. "cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the law by carrying them out. then all the people shall say, "amen!" " deut 27:14-26 the new testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting christ is the curse. "if anyone does not love the lord - a curse be on him. " 1 corinthians 16:22 (see also: romans 12:19-21; hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26- 31; 12:14-29.) 7. how can we preach these prayers? the church of jesus christ is an army under orders. scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the commander- in-chief. but we have a problem: those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so. how then can we expect to be a united, effective army? is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? if the church does not hear the battle cries of her captain, how will she follow him onto the battlefield? pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the church's commander, never withholding or changing his words. one whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders. the pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army. there's no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn't agree with his commander's strategy. when jesus christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission, he told them to proclaim the coming of god's kingdom (lk 10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to god's rule in their lives. jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). but we must consider what he said they should do if their message were rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against god's rule - "but when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its 'streets and say, 'even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. yet be sure of this: the kingdom of god is near"' luke 10:11. what would be the result of that denunciation? i tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for sodom [on which god sent fire from heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that town (verse 12). immediately jesus added curses on korazin, bethsaida, and capernaum tor their rejection of his message (verses 13-15). he then explained to the disciples the great authority he had given them: "he who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me " (verse 16). this is the fundamental basis tor calling down god's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion against god's authority expressed in his law and the ministry of his servants. we need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the prince of peace. only then will the church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle. if we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable. like psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience. the eternal truth is that god cannot be mocked. whatever a man sows - that shall he reap (galatians 6:7). the curses pronounced on disobedience in deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in samaria (2 kings 6:2&29) and in judea (ad 70). the wrath of god upon covenant breakers is real. the "i" of the psalms is jesus christ. the "we" of the psalms includes those of us in the lord jesus. the enemies are not our own, individually, but those of the lord and of his church. the psalms are ot christ as prophet, priest, and king. they record christ's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. as christ is the author of the psalms, so, too, is he the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. god will answer the psalmist's prayers completely in jesus christ on the final day of judgment. while on earth jesus foretold the day when he will say: "but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" luke 19:27. a fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey jesus as king and lord. hearing expositions of these war psalms of the prince of peace will remind his people that god's kingdom is at war! the kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of jesus christ, a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part. you must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of god, including "the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god " eph 6:17. that battle- readiness also involves "pray(ing) in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n eph 6:18. christ teaches his army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of god as the psalmist did: "pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name" ps 79:6. to deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for god's justice. those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers. "let the saints rejoice in his honour and sing for joy...may the praise of god be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against them. this is the glory of all his saints. praise the lord. " ps 149:5-9 prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. one weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted. we handicap the army of god when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that he has given us. it is at all times a part of the task of the people nf god to destroy evil. if you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword anew, and go forth to do battle in the name and for the glory of jesus - until "the knowledge of the lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea" hab 2:14. the full book "war psalms of the prince of peace " is available, at r25, from frontline fellowship, po box 74 newlands, 7725 rsa. permission to reproduce those wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of ff news are encouraged to do so. we only request that due acknowledgement of the source be mentioned and that a copy be sent to us.
	what we call today the "old testament" was being written up to approx- imately 168 bce, according to most modern scholars. aside from the book of daniel, the whole ot predates alexander (the great). these books were written (predominantly) in hebrew. 	there were also other books being written at about this time and later by greek-speaking, or "hellenistic", jews. these books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as "apocrypha". 	before the closing of the writings, the third part of what is today called the canon, all of the books were in use by jews of the day. however, there were those who reckoned (based on zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased. this faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day. they also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from god. 	by the time of c.65 ce, another faction had entered the mess. christians had come in claiming that their writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship. therefore, the palestinian jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of ben sira (sirach) onward were not sacred writings. they justified this from zech. 13. in particular, they said, the writings of the christians (called heretics) were not inspired. 	at about 90 ce, they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the council of jamnia. a few books (ecclesi- astes, song of songs, esther) made it in after that date, but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of ben sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the christian and hellenistic writings. 	jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by jews of his day and because they were (except for sirach) not found in hebrew in his time. his criterion for separating them from the other pre-christian writings was not based on 'inspiration'. 	there is plenty more to say, but i do not have time. 	the passage you quote concerns the book (rev.) in which it is found. 						frank d.
note: the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (frank daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to daniels@math.ufl.edu 	i am unable to post to the bitnet groups. 	here is a capsule history of the shepherding/discipleship movement in the churches of christ (i.e. crossroads/boston): 	i could trace the movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its roots go back that far, but these were really "influences" on the movement, and not the actual movement, per se. 	i will start in c.1920. 	in that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in nearly every area (due to segregation). modern pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon. here, there was great fanaticism, emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the holy spirit. 	many 'white' protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism. by the 1940s, the evangelical movement was in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it. 	when the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 1960's), many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and by what was going on there. this spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's. in 1969, even the catholic church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups...still evident today. 	the churches of christ are (and were) a very conservative protestant group. when the influence from outside began to reach the cofc in c.1965, it was generally not appreciated. conservative groups are very strongly resistant to change, and the new movement was very different from the cofc status quo. 	the magazines put out at that time by cofc folks tell the story as it unfolds. new ideas came into the cofc. there was a big push to reach out to college students, young adults, and teens. some called this the campus evangel- ism movement. emotions, generally not highly regarded in the cofc at large, played a more important role in the new movement. in some places, people began to speak in tongues (as their pentecostal predecessors did). 	this was met with extreme criticism from within the churches of christ. in some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or for advocating the "holy spirit movement", another name for the new branch. the term "underground church of christ" also came into use because these people had to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised). 	there were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never really caught on). one of these was the 14th street church of christ in gainesville, fl. campus ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th street, and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism. they also seemed to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking. 	in october of 1967, the 14th street congregation hired chuck lucas to be its campus minister. by 1970, he would move to being the congregation's (lead) minister. in the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with many other groups. they held bible discussions at daytona beach during spring break. they organized talks in the fraternities on the university of florida campus. they also worked with uf sports people. 	in 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed. when it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer appropriate). it became the crossroads church of christ from then on, a name that would become legendary. 	by this time, crossroads was basically the only cofc whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement. while they didn't start it, they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going. 	by 1975, none of the other churches of christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at crossroads. 	crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require attendance at all church functions. it was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of your problems, pray, and get help from. the concept was called prayer partners, which later became discipleship partners and also later became mandatory. the leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while. 	the book called "the master plan of evangelism" was a strong influence on chuck lucas. he (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission. crossroads was growing in number, and numbers became very important (some would say all-important). 	a person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual". evangelism meant inviting people to crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them converted, then you were "spiritual". there were sermons about how if you bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services. everyone at your job ought to receive invitations. since these people needed jesus, you should be "aggressive"--don't take 'no' for an answer. 	if you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or "unspiritual". 	by the end of the decade, the prayer partner system was integrated into a structure. the elders and ministers were on top (like a big pyramid). then the group leaders, bible study leaders, and members. everyone who came in had someone placed over them. 	it is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about crossroads began to circulate. the problem with rape on the university of florida campus was tremendous, but crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem. there were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy" evangelistic tactics. crossroads was considering the other churches of christ to be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated them. 	by this time, crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100) where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but also they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and "reconstructing" [reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities. by this time, the crossroads movement was underway. 	a group was sent to the 30-member lexington church of christ in boston, ma. the team was headed up by kip mckean, who had been converted out of a fraternity by crossroads (in gainesville). kip held a still stronger view of church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the evangelist(s), and not so much in the elders. he had been fired in 1977 from the congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over- one christianity. [called this by critics] 	in the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want to be a part of the new congregation. they left. but others began coming into the new boston church of christ. 	ah, but i'm ahead of myself. 	at crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on the members. many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but they were not achieving the results that were so important. the numbers were dropping. from 1978, crossroads membership declined steadily. the leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely "unproductive" and "unfruitful". the "fruit" passages in the nt were interpreted as referring to new converts. if you were not bearing fruit, said john 15, you would be cast into the fire! [boston still teaches this.] 	if you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church and convert him). if you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor. and if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding. the logical arguments continue in this vein. 	in 1985, chuck lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to recurring sins in his life. these struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them. for by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most crossroads members and those outside. [if you have contact, your focus should be on converting them. bring them to a bible study.] 	chuck's replacement was joe woods, who was fully supportive of the boston system. as boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' sessions for other ministers. joe went to boston to be trained and returned to cross- roads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that boston and kip mckean were now emphasizing. eventually, in fall of 1987, the elders at crossroads (now 2 in number--dick whitehead and bill hogle) made a decision. boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in boston. the elders refused, citing their belief that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-boston churches of christ). perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the movement. the group now numbered about 800, while boston was now larger (in membership). 	the churches of christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation. at crossroads, they taught what was called 'lordship' baptism: you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized. you had to 'count the cost'. at boston, they took this a step further. if at some time you became "unproductive", then your spirituality was suspect. people would begin to ask you if you really understood what you were getting into. anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid: they hadn't counted the cost properly. they still had to be baptized. others called this "rebaptism", and crossroads didn't approve of this practice. 	when crossroads announced that it would not follow boston, many of its members left crossroads and went to movement-related ministries, which were now called discipling ministries. you were either discipling (evangelizing) or you were "dead". they also used the nickname "movement of god" for a while. 	by summer of 1988, crossroads was withdrawn from the movement and now stood alone. they had few to no allies in the mainstream churches of christ, and now none in the movement. 	boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following. they sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities, which usually meant that they split the church there. they stopped acknowledging other churches of christ as christians and began to call themselves the "remnant". the "remnant" of the jews in the ot are those who are saved by god. it was felt that the "remnant" today represents all the christians. sometimes they would simply call their movement "the church". 	they usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the other churches of christ that boston did not recognize their existence. many campuses have now formally forbidden boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints. in some cases, it has been documented that boston ministries have lied to university officials in order to continue to have access to the campus. any resistance that they experience is termed "perse- cution", which all true christians are expected to experience. are you really a christian if you're not being persecuted? 	the numbers at boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989. since then, they have fought to remain steady. i have heard a tape of kip mckean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the great commission (their life's purpose) as god commanded them. their christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience. 	crossroads once was called a cult. boston is now recognized by the cult awareness network and other national and international groups as a cult, under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ. the term "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of those techniques. the techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other shepherding discipleship groups. [robert jay lifton, margaret thaler singer, and many others have written about the topic.] these techniques include guilt motivation, emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others. 	i have no particular axe to grind against the movement. i have numer- ous friends who are still part of the movement. i have never had a 'falling out' with anyone in the movement. i disagree with many things which they teach. i recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system. i hold no loyalty to the mainstream churches of christ and do not defend their mistakes either. 	i want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar, the leadership of the boston movement are as much victims of the system as the members. we do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people. the leaders believe what they teach, and they feel accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members. when members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel personally responsible as well. the leaders are not out for money or power. they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime. 	i have said too much, but there is much more to say. there are many examples i could give and quotes from other sources (including boston bulletins) that i could include. but this is too long already. you may post this if you so desire. 						frank d. | "answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him." | | "answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit." | | (proverbs 26:4&5) [believe it or not, questions about the boston church of christ are among the most commonly asked. in order to avoid having s.r.c. dealing with this on a continuous basis, i allow discussion only periodically. by now i've got a 150k faq file (which has both sides, by the way). this gives enough addition information on history that it seems worth posting and adding to the faq. --clh]

ok, what's more important to gay christians? sex, or christianity? christianity i would hope. would they be willing to forgo sex completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, etc? if not, why not? heterosexuals abstain all the time. (it would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life) to tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of henry the viii starting the church of england in order to get a divorce (or is this a myth). note that i am not denying that gay christians are christian. -- darin johnson djohnson@ucsd.edu -- toy cows in africa

[1 cor. 6:12] which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before god. a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break. some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. it is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of god's messengers. i won't deal with the exegesis of leviticus, except very tangentially. fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means. there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus, most of which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine them. they just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and which ones are "ritual." well, i have news for you. any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the "ritual law" which no christian i know feels applies to us. i'm dead serious here. when people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating insects. on what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in leviticus is not a part of the ritual law? for those christians who *do* think that *some* parts of leviticus can be "law" for christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you "pick" one and ignore another. i frankly think the whole effort misguided. reread paul: "no doubt i am free to do anything." but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the great commandment of love for god and neighbor. if you cannot go through leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy. in this context, it is remarkably offensive to say: >i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. well, la-ti-da. so what? this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape. i know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality. it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut. if you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world. if *you* want to address bestiality, that is your business, not mine. and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings. you want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so. jesus and paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and all else depends on that. gay and lesbian christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues. christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of usenet and the world, and all they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in total ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is. such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ. why, for god's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnations? is that loving your neighbor? god forbid! is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or condemn others? christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in paul that you are so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do. why, for god's sake? 	"for god did not send the son into the world 	to condemn the world, 	but that the world might be saved through him. 	whoever believes in him is not condemned, 	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 	for refusing to believe in the name of god's only son. 	now the judgment is this: 	the light has come into the world, 	but men have preferred darkness to light 	because their deeds were evil. 	for everyone who practices wickedness 	hates the light, 	and does not come near the light 	for fear his deeds will be exposed. 	but he who acts in truth 	comes into the light, 	so that it may be sh0own 	that his deeds are done in god."	john 3:17-21 for long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected. some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of god's light. blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified. however, we have seen the truth, and the truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not we who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us. -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7
some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on numerology. (that's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another. i can never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to prove.) somebody posted a long article about numerology in the bible, saying things like "this proves the intricate planning of the scriptures, else these patterns would not appear". then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the other numerology posts. stuff like "the word `numerology' adds up to 28, and the word appears 28 times in the posting! such elegant planning! further, the word `truth' also adds up to 28; the writer is using these numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!" (these examples are made up by me just as examples.) i really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing that these patterns can be found in just about anything. however, i did not save a copy of it. i do not remember the author. i'm only 90% sure that it was posted to this newsgroup. but, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the author is reading here, i wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.

this week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on ot, nt and intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue. i have refered you to the faq files, which i find out, no longer contains them. they are too long for me to mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the faq file. because of the renewed interest on this subject, i will type, with permission, an article by james deyoung. i think it is one of the best articles that i've read todate from the conservative position. i can't post it all at once, so it will come piece meal and not daily. after i'm done retyping the entire article, i will make it available for the faq file. talk to clh. also, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these: rexlex@fnal.fnal.gov lexrex@almond.fnal.gov loren senders@admail.fnal.gov the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai, with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b. deyoung professor of new testament western conservative baptist seminary portland, oregon traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 cor 6:9 and 1 tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex, specifically homosexualitiy. some restrict the term's meaning to "active male prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation, namely "homosexuals." more recently the definition "homosexual" has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term "homosexuals" is anachronistic. in addition, criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. a concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world. the foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. finally, this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it from the lxx of lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline (i cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 tim 1:8-11). ************************************* introduction coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy. as part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used twice by the apostle paul (1 cor 6:9, i tim 1:10), has received vigorous scrutiny. this issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements. more particularly, the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation. this study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution. several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word. three authors, bailey, boswell, and scroggs, have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the ministry. footnotes: _______________________ 1. for convenience sake, the term "homosexual" is used to encompass both same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior. the meaning of this term is one of the main considerations of this study. 2. these times are differnt from just over a century ago. then p fairbairn (pastoral epistles [edinburg, 1874) 891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it is a "term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent." unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and study. the present writer endorses the pauline authorship of the pastoral epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see donald guthrie, new testament introduction, [4th ed; 1990] 621-649, for an extensive discussion and citation of supporters of the pauline authorship). 3. for example, see scroggs' influence on m. olson, "untangling the web," the other side (april 1984): 24-29. for a study suggesting a further prohibition of homosexuality in the ot, see a. phillips, "unconvering the father's skirt," vt 30/1 (jan, 1980) 38-43. for a bibliography of other sources dealing with arsenokoitai, see the wisondisc religion indexes (ny: h. wison co., 1987).

(much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony get known.) what we have in the 40 day literature, the egyptian ceremonies, and certain native american ceremonies is almost certainly not exactly what jesus taught. 2. certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the situation, much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the audio-visual tools now available.

how many people have lied or sinned in other ways? >but in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a >reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a >specific feature of homosexuality. why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality? paul describes "men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts. sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying god as god and being thankful. still, their acts were shameless. >homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases. on the >other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the >subject. rom 1 is really about idolatry. it refers to homosexuality >in passing. is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the new testament? scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer. being ruled by the spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the spirit. the word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways. i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus. if the law is reflection of god's character and true holy nature, then those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem. if homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by god, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in leviticus. this condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case. furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime! is every sin elaborated on in the new testament? take a look at i corinthians 5. paul said that one of the corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. there is a prohibition against having your father's wife in leviticus. no other new testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.) notice that paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife. notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either. and there was no pagan coustom mentioned in i corinthians either. as a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the gentiles. it was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not. >one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds >of questions we are trying to deal with. he encountered homosexuality >only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >wrong. he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act >"straight" and fail, and he had never faced christians who are trying >to define a christian homosexuality, which fits with general christian >ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >relationship between god and man. it is unfair to take paul's >judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >judgements on these questions. one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because paul probably did face this and other problems. sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power. is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex? i doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. god is greater than all of it. another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of god to intervene in this kind of situation. how many people have been set free from sin by the power of god? sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. that is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not god's willingness and ability to change a sinner. any program that uses formulas may fail. what people need is the power of god to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin. >i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is >not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one. paul's >tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating >holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues >to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to >avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. >for example, while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat >meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about >which they had personal qualms. i don't see how you come to that conclusion. paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult. take the example of eating meat offered to idols. paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat. yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others. but paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough. paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof." (romans 13:14) then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others. suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts. since others consider it to be a sin, then using paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex. paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual "marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin. >for another example, paul obviously >would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) >remain unmarried. yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly >would rather see them married than in a state where they might be >tempted to fornication. yet marriage itself is not a sin. marriage is holy in all- and something that god ordains, and paul recognizes this. > note that in the >creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. this >doesn't mean that christians can stop working when we are saved. actually, adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. after he fell he would have to toil over the ground. >the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often >fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from >psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when >attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. that is why we are dependent totally on god- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it. we all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else. >but i can well imagine paul >preferring to see people in long-term, committed christian >relationships than promiscuity. as with work -- which genesis >suggests wasn't part of god's original ideal either -- i think such >relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god's love >with each other. i'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion. it's like saying, "how should i kill myself, with gun or aresenic? what about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats? would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them? what about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them? in all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease. but this only deals with physical aspects of the question. whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death. >cent. actions are the same. when christian homosexuals say that their >relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul >would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of >argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. the issue that is most often addressed in scripture seems to be the actual act. second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving relationships?" there are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love." (btw, i am one who believes in refraining from making oathes. also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners. that's certainly not explicit. jesus didn't tell zachias to quit his job.) link hudson. [i'm reluctant to comment in this in detail. our basic concepts of the intention of jesus and paul are greatly different. as i indicated in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and i still think they are significant), it does seem clear that paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong. what you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the bible. i'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist christians is even harder than between protestants and catholics in the 16th cent. since you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions. sometimes discussion is still useful. i've seen some very interesting work on paul done by jews. obviously they don't agree with him, but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant. but i don't see much sign for hope here. in talk.religion.misc there's an axiom that by the time hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible discussion is gone. on this subject, when sleeping with goats is invoked, i don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing. --clh]

david hammerslag asked: 	how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage 	with christ's statement that in the resurrection people will 	neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. 20)? several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed, but most lds scholars whose opinions i have studied take more or less one of the following three positions: (1) jesus was talking to a group of people (sadducees) who were trying to trip him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa- tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they didn't believe in). these people -- and those associated with them ("now there were with us seven brethren", matt. 22:25) -- would not be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage. hence, the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni- ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not have this blessing. (2) jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married. the latter activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of before then. (3) the account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic gospels) is missing something that would make its real meaning clearer. note that we (lds) do not believe in biblical inerrancy, so we do not in general feel obliged to reconcile each and every bible text with modern revelation through joseph smith and other latter-day proph- ets. nor are we particularly upset that the account in question was not significantly revised in the "joseph smith translation" or "inspired version" of the bible, since we do not believe this work was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the jst con- stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the kjv. -- rich wales <richw@mks.com> // mortice kern systems inc.

----- begin included message ----- the following teaching is brought to you on behalf of malcolm smith ministries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of god. if you would like more info on the ministry, and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial, e-mail to randy hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com. love in the morning (psalm 90:14) by malcolm smith moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of israel. a generation before the time of its writing, the people of israel had stood at kadesh, gateway to canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than god's way. they refused an adventure of faith in god which would have given them canaan, the homeland of promise. god honored their decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. the young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. the lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness. moses described it as ending each year with a sigh (v. 9). the fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence. whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years. the only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb, who had stood against the nation at kadesh and had god' s promise of one day entering the land. the forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. the new generation, those who were children at kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. in the light of this, moses prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over. all these years, as moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden. his was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at kadesh. the problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their god. if asked. "who is your god?" they would have described him as the god who is power. when aaron had created their concept of god in an idol. he chose a calf. or young bull--a symbol of power, of virility. in their minds, god was the young bull who had impaled pharaoh on his horns and gored egypt's gods as he led israel to sinai. but when man worships a god of power, his miracles grow thin and even boring. after miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the god of almightiness becomes "ho-hum --what' s next on the miracle menu?" and a god of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. he might be all they need, but then...who knows? if he has all power, he has a right to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. the only person these people had known who had absolute power was pharaoh, and men's lives had hung on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. they believed god could work his wonders on their behalf, but they did not know him and, so, could not trust him. israel had a god based on what he did, his acts; moses knew the heart of god, the motivation behind the acts. from the day of his encounter at the burning bush, moses had been fascinated by god. at sinai, he asked to be shown his glory...to know who he really was. he had seen what god had done; he wanted to know who god was. this request was granted, and moses was given a glimpse of god's glorious person. he had come to know the heart of god as compassion and lovingkindness (exodus 34:6,7). the word "lovingkindness" is not to be understood as a human kind of love. it speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant. it can only be understood as the love that says, "i will never leave you nor forsake you." lovingkindness is as tenacious as a british bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.and it is not human romantic love, based on feelings and rooted in emotions. it is a love of covenant commitment and, therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. god's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of his being to seek our highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. god does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses his feelings of love toward us...we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with us! if that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause him to reject us. he is love, and he loves us because of who he is-- not because of who we are. he does not love what we do, but he is committed to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. he will not let us go. his is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us-- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. it is saying to the recipient, "for as long as we shall live, i am for you." the god who has revealed himself to man through scripture and, finally, in jesus--in his coming, and in his death and resurrection--is the god who is lovingkindness. thus he loves us and gives himself to us...he will never leave us nor forsake us. tragically, many believers have never seen him as love; they see him as power. no one will come to faith by just seeing miracles. miracles point to who he is, and that is when faith springs in the heart. israel did not see god as lovingkindness; they saw his acts of power. moses knew his ways, the kind of god he was, and the love that he had for these people. because of their total lack of understanding of his love, they could not trust him to be their strength in taking the land. faith is born out of knowing the love he has for us; it is the resting response to the one who gives himself to us. he is not the force, and to call him the almighty is to miss his heart. he is love who is the almighty and the infinite force. if man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. but the power that issues from love demands faith in the person of love himself. the forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the god of love. at this point, with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that god promised, moses prays verse 14. the language moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. it is waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for, protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. suppose we were to ask, "what has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" our questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. the child was conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. the parents' love is unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance. so god is love. he loves us unconditionally, spontaneously. we were conceived in his imagination and fashioned after his image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the lord jesus. it is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love. the child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. it is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if it survives, will have severe emotional problems. and a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god. moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in the love of god. and will receive all his promises and blessings with joy and gladness. significantly, moses prays that they will be satisfied with his love. "satisfied." in the hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. it is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water. moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of god. that sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman. when we are satisfied in our deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems disappear. man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane. apart from god, man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in religious exercise. but man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living god. only in knowing god's love will the rest of life make sense. as the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken, moses prayed this psalm. i find it fascinating that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his love. considering the awe with which the people held moses. one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. but moses knew better. god is the only one who can make known to us his love. we won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him. nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us god feelings. it is god, himself, the lover, who must open our eyes and satisfy us with his love. this prayer is man, in helplessness, asking god to make the love he is real in our hearts. moses' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in the book of judges. but it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the holy spirit, who pours out the love of god in our hearts (romans 5:5). in the history of the early church, we read of the holy spirit "falling upon" the believers. this is an ancient expression that, in modern english, means to give a bear hug. it is used in luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on his neck and kissing him." the holy spirit is god hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being. this is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes. moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved. the world, and much of our religious training, has taught us to perform in order to be accepted. we have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance and love from others, and from god. we now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn...to be still and let him tell us we are loved: to let the holy spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of god. we come in stillness to think on and repeat his words of love to our minds. which have been jaded with the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." we begin to realize that he loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. i challenge everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your eyes, by celebrating the god of love and praying this prayer. you may not feel anything, but something always happens. i was x-rayed the other day. i did not see or feel anything, but i noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls. they know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected. so it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved. such experiential knowledge will produce, according to moses, "joy and gladness all our days." joy is the result of a life that is functioning as god intended us to function when he made us. you might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. man' s highest performance is to rest in the love god has for him... the hum will be joy, and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life. stop wandering in the wilderness. be satisfied with his love and, in joy, day by day, receive all his promised blessings. ----- end included message -----

"essence" in the platonic sense does not have any referent as far as i can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways. so, to attribute an 'essence' to god is to attribute to him something that does not exist!! thus the orthodox platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of god in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence', thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address. thus, to me, the unity of god must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one. -- sarima@teradata.com			(formerly tdatirv!sarima) or stanley.friesen@elsegundoca.ncr.com [i think one can read augustine as saying something consistent with your comments. his "de trinitate" -- which has been very influential in the west -- defines the distinction among the persons relationally. you're probably at one extreme of orthodox views, but i'm not sure your views are necessary incompatible with the trinity. --clh]

(12.5-6) my understanding of this silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronaut's air-line to his spaceship. when a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken: astral projection can be dangerous! bulle, i think, reports a case of a yogi off on an oobe who was found dead in his apartment, with no apparent external cause. barney resson "many shall run to and fro, & knowledge shall increase" (daniel)

	from: dhammers@pacific.? (david hammerslag) 	how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with 	christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither 	marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. 20)? footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the book of tobit. tobit is in the septuagint. goodspeed published it in a book called "the apocrypha". most any bookstore will have this. at any rate, the jews of christ's day had this book. it is a story mostly centered around the son of tobit who was named tobias. there was a young lady, sarah, who had entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. the brothers all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage. tobias was entitled to have sarah for his wife (3:17) because tobias was her only relative and "...she was destined for [tobias] from the beginning" (6:17). tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. the seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. that does not eliminate tobias, her eighth husband. tobit is a fun and interesting story to read. it's kind of a mythical romance. it's a little shorter than esther. the lds also have scriptures that parallel and amplify luke 20. most notably doctrines and covenants 132:15-16.

until recently i always understood the term "kingdom theology" to mean the theology of the kingdom of god, but now i have discovered that there is a new and more specialized meaning. i gather that it is also called "dominion theology", and that it has to do with a belief that christians must create a theocratic form of government on earth before christ will come again. i have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but i am told that it is a very widespread belief in the usa. can anyone give me any more information about it? here are some of my questions: 1. is it the teaching of any particular denomination? if so, which? 2. where and when does it start? 3. are there any particular publications that propagate it? 4. are there any organizations that propagate it? ============================================================ steve hayes, department of missiology & editorial department univ. of south africa, p.o. box 392, pretoria, 0001 south africa internet: hayesstw@risc1.unisa.ac.za fidonet: 5:7101/20 steve.hayes@p5.f22.n7101.z5.fidonet.org faq: missiology is the study of christian mission and is part of the faculty of theology at unisa

(marty helgesen) writes: when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the church may investigate it. if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god, it will be approved. that means that it can be preached in the church. however, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from god. a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at fatima and lourdes. (i suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox catholics in good standing.) it may be a bit much to say that a catholic is free to deny what happened at fatima. that's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying that a catholic is free to deny that hong kong exists. what a catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of fatima, without being called a heretic. you can be labeled other things for such an offense, but not a heretic. theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like fatima and lourdes. things revealed by god through jesus christ or his apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of god: total and unswerving. fatima and lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history. perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the church. "approval" of an apparition by the church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the catholic faith. i personally think of private revelations as our lord's way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history. he gave us all the doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what he gave us. catholic devotion to the sacred heart was a result of a series of apparitions to st. margaret mary alacoque, for example. the problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our lord into someone without a heart. the fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the church (we are living it), and what to do to save the most souls possible in such a situation.

(aaron bryce cardenas) writes: romans 10:16-17 "but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for isaiah says, 'lord, who has believed our message?' consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of christ." so then we receive god's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god's word preached. kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to god's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life. catholics view the effects of baptism slightly differently, and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies. they believe that baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby. this change in the baby's soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without baptism. since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant. but as the child gets older, the gifts of baptism come more and more into play. ezekiel 18:20 "the soul who sins will die. the son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." if you read all of ezekiel 18, you will see that god doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam. adam was given a number of gifts by god. the chief among them was what catholics call "sanctifying grace". (in the new testament, the word used for this is "charity".) by his sin, adam lost this grace. he didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole human race. because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his descendents. that's why catholics baptize babies. through his original sin, adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents. christ instituted baptism to give it back to everyone. babies are not being punished for anything they personally did; they are simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter heaven.
although simplistic i have always liked the fact that "a christian is one who not only believes in god, but believes god." after all the name was first given externally to identify those who "preached christ and him crucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before god. god said this was his son -- i belive him. -- scott dittman email: sdittman@wlu.edu university registrar talk: (703)463-8455 fax: (703)463-8024 washington and lee university snail mail: lexington virginia 24450 [it's certainly a good things for christians to follow. but as a definition it may be a bit hard to apply. --clh]

poram@ihlpb.att.com writes: on these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god. to quote unger's bible dictionary on the apocrapha: 1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred scripture. 3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture. 4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling. first, to point out the obvious: while #4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the ot (or for that matter the nt) that doesn't, on some issues, in some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests. second, one factor the deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition. i don't recall the exact dating of all of the books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the canonical books (i.e. daniel). furthermore, while the deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in greek, they are clearly deeply _hellenistic_ in nature. both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons. these may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have shown, i think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity. nichael ;(and (funcall (get 'smurfy-smile-icon 'like-predicate) 'lisp) (sys::honk))

(this is an edition of text of acts that makes the assumption that the text in codex bezae is the more authentic. i don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: "the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in acts", eldon j epp (cambridge, 1966). 4] the most recent reference i found was an edition in french from the early '80s. (i can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find. so if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: "a textual commentary on the greek nt", bruce metzger (united bible society, 1971). metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of the greek nt. it contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the ubs3. furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in atcotgnt (the majority of these occur in acts). in particular in the introduction to the section on acts metzger writes: "[an attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an english translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by western witnesses ... since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). >i understand that one of the early codexes, vaticanus and siniaticus has >this version of acts. it would be interesting to know what the >differences are between the long and the short forms. 6] most of the copies of the text of acts that we have (including the ones in vaticanus and siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or alexandrian) version. the longer version to which you refer is usually called the "western" version and its main witness is the codex bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] as far as size, the difference is that in clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by westcott and hort (a typical alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] to answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. the main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the alexandrian). the western text seems to be given to more detail. there are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy. if there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not. n

in the course of discussing the sabbath with some folks, i came across something that was completely new to me, and i thought i'd offer it for comment. to keep this as brief as possible, let me state my observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever wants to can comment on it. basically, what i think i've observed is that the phrase "the ten commandments", as used by moses, is not a reference to ex. 20:1-17, but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from ex. 20:1 through ex. 31:18. that is, the phrase "the ten commandments" should more accurately be translated "the ten discourses", of which the passage we call the "ten commandments" is really only the first. i'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though i was sure. arguments supporting the above idea: 1) there aren't really ten commandments in ex. 20:1-17. in order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods. that is, verse 3 commands to have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse 4. you can't violate verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with only nine "commandments". i could go on at length about this, but for now i'll just stop with this summary. 2) there are ten speeches between ex 20:1 (the beginning of the traditional "ten commandments") and ex 31:18 (where god actually gives moses the two tablets with the ten commandments/discourses written on them). i break these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; 25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; 31:1-11; and 31:12-18. in most cases, each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase, "and the lord spoke to moses, saying..." the exception is ex. 21:1, which begins "now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them..." 3) the word translated "commandments" in the phrase "the ten commandments" isn't really the word for "commandment", its the word for a speech, or an utterance. it's a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements; for instance, when combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is translated "chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the chronicles of x?..." the word for "commandment" is freely used throughout the books of moses, and perhaps it is significant that when moses spoke of the ten x's, he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command. 4) god tells moses that he is going to give him the stone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (ex 24:12), yet he does not give moses the tablets until he has finished all ten discourses on mount sinai. if the ten commandments were only ex. 20:1-17, it is not immediately clear why god would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to moses. on the other hand, if we have the ten discourses written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that god would not give moses the tablets until he had finished delivering all ten discourses. 5) when moses did get the tablets, he found that both tablets were written on both sides (ex. 32:15). if these ten "commandments" were only the first 17 verses of ex. 20, god would have had to have written in large letters! not that he couldn't have, of course, but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal- sized letters. 6) in ii cor. 3, paul seems to specifically single out the "commandments written on stone" as being the "ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and "the ministry of condemnation." with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath, it is difficult to see why paul would refer to the commands in ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type commandments. this is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from ex 20 through ex 31. arguments against this idea: the main argument against this idea, aside from the fact that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that in dt 5:22, moses says, after quoting the commands in ex. 20:1-17, "these words the lord spoke...and he added no more. and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me." this appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets. that was my first impression, anyway. however, after some thought, i noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase "these words." if moses meant "these words *which i have just related to you* were spoken by god" etc., then that would mean that only the traditional "ten commandments" were on the stone tablets. if, however, moses was making a parenthetical comment--"these words *which i am now telling you* were spoken by god" etc.--then that's quite different. i did note that in the dt 5 account, moses tells of being given the stone tablets before telling of the people asking moses to represent them before god, whereas in the exodus account, the people asked this of moses between the first and second discourses, several days before god gave moses the stone tablets. this reinforces the idea that moses' remarks in dt 5:22ff were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a strictly chronological account of when god wrote what, and at what point he stopped adding to what was on the tablets. summary: all things considered, i find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in ex 20 are really only the first of what moses regarded as the ten discourses of god. i don't know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before; it's brand-new to me. so, while i lean towards accepting it, i would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer. - mark

several replies to my post have said that i should get to know christian homosexuals before judging them. i maintain that i was not judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong. i would like to look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical evaluation of the people who responded to the side of christianity and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals but i know that many are from their e-mail responces). i don't normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but since i have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point i will. so far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because i don't have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling. if you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you who are homosexual christians show me the diffrence. in christ's love, bryan

on 20 april, stephen mcintyre writes: > i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in > heaven knowing that even one man would spend his "eternal life" > being scorched for his wrongdoings.... stephen, i suspect that when you and i use the word "hell," we have different concepts in mind. when you encounter references to heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, i trust that you do not suppose (or suspect christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the concept of heaven is all about. why then should you suppose that about the "fires" of hell? have you read the novel atlas shrugged? do you remember the last description of james taggart, sitting on the floor beside the ferris persuader? this comes close to a description of what is meant by hell in my circles. if the image of fire is often used in this connection, there are two reasons that occur to me. the first reason is that it conveys the idea of hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read atlas shrugged, a smaller audience than those who have played with matches). the second reason is the history of the hebrew word "gehenna," one of the words translated "hell" in the new testament. it refers to the valley of hinnon, outside jerusalem. in early days, it was a place where the canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive) to molech. later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of jerusalem. "to be cast into gehenna" or "to burn in gehenna" thus became a metaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless." lest you think that identifying hell with the fate of james taggart is my own private fancy, i commend to you the book the great divorce, by c s lewis. it discusses heaven (no harps) and hell (no flames). it is shorter than atlas shrugged, and available at most bookstores and libraries. yours, james kiefer

"christianity in crisis" by: hank hanegraaff "controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin. controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command." -dr. walter martin dr. walter martin personally selected hank hanegraaff to succeed him as president of the christian research institute -- the largest evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. in this skillful, careful treatment of an explosive subject, hanegraaff documents and examines how the beliefs of the word of faith movement clearly compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic christian faith. for the first time ever, this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic. in this book, hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the word of faith movement as e.w. kenyon and the twelve apostles of "another gospel" (gal 1:6-9) (kenneth e. hagin, kenneth copeland, benny hinn, frederick k.c. price, john avanzini, robert tilton, marilyn hickey, paul (david) yonggi cho, charles capps, jerry savelle, morris cerullo, and paul and jan crouch). the book is now available through harvest house publishers and should be in most christian book stores soon. you can order a hard-back copy through cri for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail mark-ups. the christian research journal, which is a quarterly publication by cri has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, "what's wrong with the word faith movement?" this is a good article that will inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your book arrives. if you are interested in receiving the journal yourself, you can order it from cri at the number above for $14 a year. it is the best source of the most-accurate and well-researched info in christiandom today.

let's look at what the bible has to say about it. i don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not. certainly they *can*, as the example of john in utero proves. i find the translation of col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the kjv and rsv put in terms of christ's cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh. also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with christ by faith. who says both are by faith? this interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless. like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience. baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of god. it imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy. > >romans 10:16-17 "but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for >isaiah says, 'lord, who has believed our message?' consequently, faith >comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word >of christ." > >so then we receive god's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the >gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god's word preached. kids >are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to >respond to god's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot >be raised in baptism to a new life. do you teach a child to pray the lord's prayer?

[continuing with dr. deyoung's article-] survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai d.s. bailey d.s. bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai. he takes the term in i cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who engage passively in such acts.*4 however, he insists that paul knew nothing of "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion" (38). hence bailey limits the term's reference in paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as "homosexuals." bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in source]. paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt's translation "sodomites" best represents paul's meaning in bailey's judgment (39). bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers. j. boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of john boswell.*5 whereas the usual translation*6 of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, boswell gives it a passive sense. in an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic evidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes." his argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity. hence the term, according to boswell, designates a male sexual person or male prostitute. he acknowledges, however, that most interpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make their bed with, men." boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting. he argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes ("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such as paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance. his point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning. more directly, he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective (343). yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-. boswell next appeals to the latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects. the greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci; the corresponding passive would be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), boswell affirms. he claims that arsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute," since by paul's time the attic words pornos ("fornicator") and porneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the lxx, had been adopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication."*7 in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus, plato, aristotle, and plutarch, and from the jewish writers philo and josephus, boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of paul" (346).*8 he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo-lucian, sextus empiricus, and libanius. he subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions of homosexual relation" (346)*9 among christian sources in greek, including the didache, tatian, justin martyr, eusebius,*10 clement of alexandria, gregory of nyssa, and john chrysostom. chrysostom is singled out for his omission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers (348).*12 cited are tertullian, arnobius, lactantius, and augustine. the last named uses "circumlocutions." other latin writers include ausonius, cyprian, and minucius felix. the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation. by the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife (353). having surveyed the sources, boswell concludes, there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter, and every reason to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353). it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes. he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of "gay inclination," "gay relationships," "enduring love between persons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism" (112, 166-17). ________________________________________________________ 4. d.s. bailey, homosexuality and the western christian tradition.

from bit.listserv.christia zane writes... from: facn34b@saupm00.bitnet (zane of dhahan) >newsgroups: bit.listserv.christia subject: christianity in crisis date: wed may 12 14:43:19 1993 "frank, first of all, thanks for all of the great scripture verses. it was a pleasure to read them." my reply... you are welcome, zane. zane... "i am sure nothing that i will say will change your mind about it... but i would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you. i mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you have read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your christian life?" my reply... (1) when i first became a christian, i entered into the word/faith movement. it was easy. i wasn't grounded in the word of god and sound doctrine. when i visited christian book stores, the cheapest books i could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by hagin and others. consequently, i began receiving hagin's monthly magazine (and they still send it to me), and also copeland's (also, still sent to me). it wasn't until i read a booklet by jimmy swaggart called _hyper faith: the new gnosticism_ that i began to realize the teachings i were partaking of were error. i started reading the bible more and studying more. sure enough, jimmy was right in many points. as part of my experience, i am alerting christians, particularly new christians, that these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the bereans did in acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with scripture! (2) my brother in law was involved in a word/faith "cult" in my area - it's leader is real good friends with benny hinn. rather then going into much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and has now fallen into atheism. i'm still praying for him (phil. 1:6). (3) the assistant pastor at the church i teach adult sunday school in has been a `follower' of copeland for 15 years. he has thousands of tapes by the faith teachers. in the class recently, i quoted several of the teachers' heretical statements to his surprise. since then, i've been able to talk to him at length about these issues. (4) the leader of the women's group at my church is a benny hinn `fan'. recently, i found that she has been lending _good morning, holy spirit_ to women in the church. that prompted my quotes in sunday school, as well as my lending cic to people in the church. i'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies. what heresies? a. jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became one with him. b. jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone. c. jesus was dragged to hell after his death, was beat and abused by satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement. satan was ruling over him there. d. jesus was `born-again' in hell. e. jesus died spiritually, lost his divinity, and reassumed it after the resurrection. f. we are gods. these are heresies. documentation will be provided re: these teachings upon request. zane... "or what does it do for you? is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating joining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved from all of that?" my reply... it wasn't _christianity in crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by swaggart that i mentioned above. but cic is much, much better - tremendous documentation and insights. zane... "i don't have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it is at best un- profitable for christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting." my reply... why do you call it "heresy hunting"? "hunting" implies it isn't readily accessible or available. this movement is the fastest growing movement in christendom. hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets. hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than swindoll and dobson combined. fred price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the usa. doesn't sound like much "hunting" is needed. it is scriptural to expose doctrinal error. i gave some verses to you before. more can be given. most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal, practical) in the churches. the early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy. it's not a new thing. remember luther? zane... "i would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un- documented opinion." my reply... (1) if you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated. (2) read ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body. eph 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting.... disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's caused by error. zane... "there are many who probably give no place for seeing the scriptures as documenting a spiritual development or growth in its writers - but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end." my reply... most scholars believe paul wrote 2 timothy last. let's examine his admonitions to tim to ascertain how mellow he had become... 2ti 1:13-15 hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in christ jesus. that good thing which was committed to you, keep by the holy spirit who dwells in us. this you know, that all those in asia have turned away from me, among whom are phygellus and hermogenes. 2ti 2:15-18 be diligent to present yourself approved to god, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. but shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. and their message will spread like cancer. hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2ti 2:24-26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if god perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will. 2ti 3:6-9 for of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. now as jannes and jambres resisted moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was. 2ti 3:12-17 yes, and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution. but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. but you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus. all scripture is given by inspiration of god, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of god may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2ti 4:2-5 preach the word! be ready in season and out of season. convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. but you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 2ti 4:14-15 alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. may the lord repay him according to his works. you also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words. zane... "the picture i have of paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears, the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves." my reply... act 20:26-31 "therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the blood of all men. "for i have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of god. "therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood. "for i know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. "also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. "therefore watch, and remember that for three years i did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. zane... "for all the warning paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf.... - but i will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him - everyone in asia wasn't it ?" my reply... paul mentioned names... 1ti 1:18-20 this charge i commit to you, son timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are hymenaeus and alexander, whom i delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. 2ti 1:15 this you know, that all those in asia have turned away from me, among whom are phygellus and hermogenes. 2ti 2:16-18 but shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. and their message will spread like cancer. hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2ti 4:10 for demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for thessalonica--crescens for galatia, titus for dalmatia. 2ti 4:14-15 alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. may the lord repay him according to his works. you also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words. so did john... 3jo 1:9-10 i wrote to the church, but diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. therefore, if i come, i will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. and not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church. jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines... rev 2:14-16 "but i have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam, who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the children of israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality. "thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans, which thing i hate. 'repent, or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. rev 2:20-23 "nevertheless i have a few things against you, because you allow that woman jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. "and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. "indeed i will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. "i will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that i am he who searches the minds and hearts. and i will give to each one of you according to your works. zane... "i question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others. maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...with no worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain... i would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less." my reply... i won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others. but even if they had bad motives, remember what paul said... phi 1:15-18 some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will: the former preach christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel. what then? only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, christ is preached; and in this i rejoice, yes, and will rejoice. zane... "if we want to be true to the admonitions of scripture - many of which you list - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines, i suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the cross." my reply... please explain. zane... "secondly, i suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships - which in the strict scriptural sense is the local city-church." my reply... if heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure. unfortunately, heresy is being taught not just in copeland's church or hagin's or hinn's or price's, but all over the radio, in print, etc. no pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church. it's imperative that leadership be made aware of this, and cic does just that. also, let's examine a passage of scripture... * eph 4:11 and he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, * eph 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of christ, these ministry gifts that the lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church, but for "the body of christ". paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message. he was also a teacher - 1co 4:17 for this reason i have sent timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the lord, who will remind you of my ways in christ, as i teach everywhere in every church. 1co 7:17 but as god has distributed to each one, as the lord has called each one, so let him walk. and so i ordain in all the churches. also - 1co 12:28 and god has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. * eph 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ; notice that the "five-fold" ministries are going to be around "till" the church is in "unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man". this, i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns (see 1cor. 13:9-12). but god wants the body to continue on maturing. what hinders maturity and unity of the body? * eph 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, it's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church "by the trickery of men" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when christians are "tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine". the "five -fold" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundaries ("pastors" appear responsible for their individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their struggle to equip the body. all believers are called to do this to a degree... jud 1:3-4 beloved, while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. for certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ. zane... "if you'll notice, in scripture the heresy hunters that went from church to church and area to area, were the "bad guys" and they went after the "good guy" namely paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic." my reply... they were themselves heretics trying to discredit paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught! zane... "let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason. and we are here for the reason. and let's hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs." my reply... yes! 2ti 2:24-26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~ god perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will. amen! frank -- "if one wished to contend with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand." job 9:3
ezek 22:26 god seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane. this brought to my mind a sermon i heard recently in which the speaker said "god's second name does not begin with a d" referring, i believe, to use of god's holy name and titles as swear words. i was also reminded of the experience of moses at the burning bush when god told him "take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." these and other texts seem to imply that god's people must treat holy things differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference" between holy and common things. the obvious questions are what makes something holy? and how are christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things?

the following was published in the may 15th rocky mountain news. i guess i have some real ethical problems with the practices at this church. i understand that baptism is an overriding factor. i also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed. unfortunately, this is becoming more typical of congregations as the second coming is perceived to approach. there is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any cost' style of theology. i wonder where trust in the lord fits into this equation? baptisms draw parents' ire -- children at church carnival in springs told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious rite. by dick foster -- rocky mountain news southern bureau colorado springs -- outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a baptist minister. doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the cornerstone baptist church, where there would be a big water fight, free balloons, squirt guns and candy. before that may 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized. in many cases they consented, although they or their families are not of the baptist faith. the baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including paulette lamontagne, a methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent. 'my understnading was they were going to a carnival. i feel that's a false pretense,' said lamontagne. her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized. cornerstone church officials defended their actions. 'we take our instructions from the word of god and god has commanded us to baptize converts. no one can show me one passage in the bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized,' said dan irwin, associate pastor of the cornerstone baptist church. church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because 'they didn't ask,' irwin said. many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were members of the cornerstone church. police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action. ------------------------------------------- aren't these the same behaviors we condemn in the hari krishnas and other cults? [i think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions. first, i'm not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required. this would be extremely difficult, because of the clear commandment to obey parents. but if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents' consent, i might be willing to do it. however this would be a serious step, and would warrant much careful discussion. the problem i find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody's consent. whether you believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a christian community. if there isn't a commitment from *somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of the church, the baptism appears to be a lie. furthermore, it is likely to raise serious practical problems. what if the child is from a baptist tradition? normally when he reaches the age of decision, he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized. but he already has been, by a church claiming to be a baptist church. so does he get rebaptized? neither answer is really very good. if not, he's being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith. --clh]

i'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which i've been thinking about: what was the process used to divide the bible into verses. i believe jerome divided the new testament, but i've never seen any discussion of *how* he did this. it seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for example, making each sentence a verse.

(i imply no moral judgement here about jack's innate sexual orientation, n.b.) maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive. van kelly vek@research.att.com

this might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which i have begun reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, i will conclude here as well. a week ago, i managed to find time to consult a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library, and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek words for love as used in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the jewish scriptures. the principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover." this cluster occurs just where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation) of israel as faithless spouse to yhwh. the verses in question are hosea 2:5,7 & 10; jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; lamentations 1:19; and ezekiel 16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22. 	[ hosea seems to have originated this usage, which jeremiah and 	 ezekiel picked up; lamentations is dependent on, though not 	 likely written by, jeremiah. ] the "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is evident. so too in english, unless you complement it with a phrase like "of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship. there is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see that standard greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the hebrew! :-) more interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later koine usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say), _eromai_ (ask), there is an error in codex vaticanus (normally, a very valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd context -- 2 samuel 20:18, where the meaning *must* be "say." in addition to the above (and the uses i have already mentioned in proverbs), esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, 	kai e:rasthe" ho basileus esthe:r -- and the king loved esther and, rather more interestingly, 1 samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan: 	kai io:nathan huios saoul e:[i]reito ton dauid sphodra 	-- and jonathan, saul's son, loved david intensely 	[ i'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which i 	 don't yet have a reasonable ascii convention for. ] (the relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of the hebrew text in the hellenistic period makes no bones about using the "erotic" verb in this context. given the quite general usage of _agapao:_ for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone would mean, but it does disambiguate the relationship, as far as this translator goes!) -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7

dhammers@pacific.? (david hammerslag) writes: >this paragraph brought to mind a question. how do you (mormons) reconcile >the idea of eternal marriage with christ's statement that in the ressurection >people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. 20)? here is the short answer: because only certain marriages are recorded in heaven. now for the long answer: in doctrine and covenants section 132, the chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes, plural marriage), the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other marriages is revealed. when "the children of this world marry, or are given in marriage" when they receive "the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage" (luke 20:34-35). jesus was simply teaching that marriages "until death do you part" are not in force after death. however, the doctrine and covenants continues describing eternal marriage. d&c 132:19 and again, verily i say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise, by him who is anointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity ai] and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. the lord told peter "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (matt 16:19). do you doubt that peter was given the power to perform sealings? peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were "heirs *together* of the grace of life" (1 peter 3:7). "in order to obtain the highest" (degree of celestial glory), a man must enter into this order of the priesthood" (d&c 131:2). when a man and wife are sealed they truly become "one flesh" because their eternal "increase" (destinies) are enjoined completely. our father has an eternal companion (and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law) who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here. there is no scriptural basis for this doctrine. if fact, the only mention of our mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the church: o my father i had learned to call thee father, through thy spirit from on high, but, until the key of knowledge was restored, i knew not why. in the heav'ns are parents single? no, the thought makes reason stare! truth is reason; truth eternal tells me i've a mother there. why don't we hear more about our mother? 1. because our father presides under priesthood authority (which is not a calling for her); 2. because we don't all (necessarily) have the same mother it would be confusing for worship; 3. because our father wishes to withhold her name and titles because of how some people degrade sacred things. a idler
on thursday 6 may 1993, dave davis writes: > i'm leaning... sirach... is more directly referenced by james > than job or ruth is... in any nt verse i've seen. it would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from sirach and from james. job 5:13 ("he taketh the wise in their craftiness") seems to be quoted in 1 corinthians 3:19. james 5:11 ("you have heard of the patience of job"), while not a quote, implies that james and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named job who exhibited exemplary patience. it is possible that the story they know is not that found in the hebrew bible, but rather another similar and related story. (one has the same problem with direct quotes.) again, matthew 1:5 ("boaz begat obed of ruth") tells us that matthew knew a story about a woman named ruth who married a man called boaz and became the ancestor of david. since ruth is not mentioned in the ot outside the book of ruth, it seems likely that matthew was familiar with the book and respected it, and thought ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy. references like this do not prove that the nt writer considered his ot source inspired or inerrant or canonical. but neither do direct quotes. yours, james kiefer
on friday 7 may 1993, marty helgesen wrote: > public revelation, which is the basis of catholic doctrine, ended > with the death of st john, the last apostle. nothing new can be > added. every so often, the pope declares that some departed christian is now in heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the church. it is my understanding that roman catholics believe that such declarations by the pope are infallible. i see three possibilities: 1) the church has received a public revelation since the death of (for example) joan of arc. 2) the church was given a list before the death of st john which had joan's name on it. 3) there is no public revelation about joan, and roman catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or even that she is a historical character. yours, james kiefer
joe moore writes: > paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side. some think > it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? whatever the > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with christianity, > yet does that make his epistles any less? paul mentions his "thorn" (skolops, actually a sharp stake) in 2 corinthians 12:7-9 + and to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of + satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. three + times i besought the lord about this, that it should leave me; + but he said to me, "my grace is sufficient for you, for my + power is made perfectr in weakness." he does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral problem. one guess is that paul had a disorder of the eyes. he ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and his signature. at the end of the letter to the galatians, he says, "see, i am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "see what a long letter i have written with my own hand." if the former translation is adopted, it seems that paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters larger, and this suggests eye problems. again, he says to the galatians (4:13-15), + you know that it was because of a bodily ailment that i preached + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an + angel of god.... for i bear you witness that, if possible, you + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. perhaps this last line means simply, "you would have done anything for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)." but in that case, we would expect some wording like, "if i had needed them." "if it were possible" sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes. william barclay, in his volume on acts, makes a more specific suggestion. before paul preached in the highlands of galatia, he had been preaching in the coastal areas of asia minor. if he had had a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills. malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision. yours, james kiefer

let the word of christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to god. colossians 3:16 a reminder: these verses are from the new international version. as with any translation, faithfulness to the original hebrew and greek may vary from time to time. if a verse sounds a little off occasionally, compare it with another translation or with the original texts, if you are able to do so. god bless you, chuck petch
ever since i was a kid and learned to tell when i was in a dream i have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems. in my dreams i have done everything from yell at my mom to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual fantasies. i have deliberately done things that i would never do in real life. i understand the need to control ones thoughts, but i always felt that dreams were format free, no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes i would have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.) is this an incorrect attitude? rather than weakening my inhibitions, i could argue that i got certain things "out of my system" by experiencing them in dreams. by analyzing a dream i can determine if i have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream something will be exagerated that i can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not. i can't believe that other people don't do the same. it seems silly to attach moral significance to dreams. i think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences, which i have never had. contradictions welcome. chris mussack
this has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with. from a long article available through an individual on this newsgroup. about scripture being against homosexuality: ------------------------------------------ when we are less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian people, engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't even mentioned. [in the bible, tk] ------------------------------------------ this frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually), especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church. so, if my interpretation is different than theirs, i am homophobic! this can't be right. disagreement in interpretation of the bible and/or rejection of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia. ==================================== ted kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu) university of georgia, athens institute of higher ed.

[this was crossposted to a zillion groups. i don't intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt.sex, particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument. however i thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion there. --clh] i intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it. i intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement. i intend to also show that such a declaration can be made without there being a religious justification for morality, in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist. anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side, i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral, or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do so. i think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it. this should be fun to try and figure this out, and i want to try and expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where their ideas are standing. as i'm not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion, i will be posting an announcement of it to several, and if someone thinks of appropriate groups, let me know. if someone on here doesn't receive alt.sex, let me know and i'll make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as i'll use that as the main forum for this. by "exception to usual policy" is that i normally charge for this, but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on internet or bitnet. i decided to start this dialog when i realized there was a much larger audience on usenet / internet than on the smaller bbs networks. to give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger, this will begin on monday, may 24, to give people who want to make the response time to identify themselves. anonymous postings are acceptable, since some people may not wish to identify themselves. also, if someone else wants to get in on my side, they are free to do so. this should be *much* more interesting than abortion debates!

" for the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of sodom and by lot as *men*. furthermore we know from gen 18:20,21 that the lord had already found sodom guilty of grievous sin--before the angels visited the city. it is clear that the grievous sin of sodom and gomorrah involved homosexual sex. it appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square--which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity. it does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as michael would have us believe. ultimately our understanding of god's will for sexuality comes from the creation story--not solely on the story of sodom and gomorrah. he created us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female, "therefore a man will leave his father and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh." this marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which god blesses and sanctions. he regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church. but we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men, or between two women. everything else that we find in the bible about sexuality derives from or expresses god's will in instituting and blessing marriage. thus the levitical code, which was given only to the jews, forbade incest, homosexuality, bestiality; the ten commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape. the men of sodom and gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse (jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage relationship. thus also paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural', romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply paul's opinion, but because it was contrary to god's purpose in creating us male and female. michael> christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here michael> and in every corner of usenet and the world, and all they michael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously michael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in total michael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest michael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can michael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they michael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss michael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what michael> it is. really, have you no better response to `slander' than more slander? david h. wagner			"the day is surely drawing near a confessional lutheran		when god's son, the annointed, 				shall with great majesty appear 				as judge of all appointed. 				all mirth and laughter then shall 					cease 				when flames on flames will still 					increase 				as scripture truly teacheth." 				--"es ist gewisslich an der zeit" v. 1 				--bartholomaeus ringwaldt, 1586

fred gilham asks (may 11) whether it is true that kurt goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of god. yes, he did. he did not publish it, but it will be published by the oxford university press in german and with english translation in volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his collected works. meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an article by jordan howard sobel called "goedel's ontological proof" in the book on being and saying, edited by judith jarvis thompson (sp?), published by the mit press in 1987. professor c anthony anderson of the philosophy department of the university of minnesota has written an article, "some emendations of goedel's ontological proof," which appeared in the magazine faith and philosophy, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. it discusses some objections that various critics have raised against goedel's proof, and offers a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these objections. yours, james kiefer

[ i observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as 	 i have just described; but another thing that characterizes 	 human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not 	 only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the 	 quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. we are 	 in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of 	 social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ] yes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it is infected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond, and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity god has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away. satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love -- but in the edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with god's grace under the power of christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for christians (though we must be vigilant, even in christ, as the devil is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.) so, returning to the original question, what is more important to straight christians? sex, or christianity? paul, clearly, tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from christianity (though to be charitable to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the hard tasks of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for an immediate eschaton. since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together. and telling people *not* to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love. i would claim that only a very few saints have the capacity to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication, mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship. we are human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to the point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending not to be sexual beings. >christianity i would hope. would they be willing to forgo sex >completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, it depends entirely on context. if that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" i am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sins. there are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift, and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin. nothing i say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift. nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics, and indeed for all god's creation, that can develop to the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded in sex. but there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance; telling people that they have to have a particular gift (or else? what?) is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from god. to one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet another prophecy; and to still another teaching. the notion that some *particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies. -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7

hi everyone, i'm trying to find my way to god, but find it difficult as i can't hear god talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and i feel that i can't possibly get to know him until he does. maybe he _is_ talking to me but i just don't know or understand how to listen. some christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find god is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. this idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but i have a few questions. 1) how do you actually commit yourself? if i just say, "ok god, her you go, i'm committing my life to you", i wouldn't really feel that he'd listened - at least, i couldn't be sure that he had. so how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to god? 2) in committing myself in this way, what do i have to forfeit of my current life? what can i no longer do? i feel that i'm as 'good' as many christians, and i try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - i don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and i try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and i would say that i keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many christians. so what do i have to give up? 3) when committed, what do i have to do? what does it involve? what (if any) burdens am i taking on? 4) so then, what's the general difference before and after? i assume, that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it won't suddenly change my life the day i commit myself. so what happens? 5) how can i be sure that it is the right thing to do? how can i find out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?! thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. perhaps e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you. ben. <benha@castle.ed.ac.uk> <janet:benha@uk.ac.ed.castle> (20 year-old at university in scotland)

[as most people here know, i believe fundamentalist is sufficiently ill-defined that i advise using some more specific term. i think many people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution). while the original fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, i would think most people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original agenda. (it included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g. the virgin birth.) the term is now being used by the press to describe aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who are attempting to legislate religion. legalism is yet another ill-defined term. however there is some reason for its use in this context. in fact the common theological definition is the believe that salvation is through the law. i hope no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this view. however there is a basic difference in approach over what we expect to get out of the bible. the conservative approach expects to find specific behavioral rules. generally the posters advocating this approach talk about the relevant passages from paul's letter as god's law. the liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the culture and other things. it's easy to see why a liberal would regard the conservative approach as legalism. it's hard to know quite what other term to use. the issue in this case is not inerrancy, because no one is saying that paul made a factual error. rather, the question is whether his statements are to be taken as law. calling the positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology. i haven't seen any good alternative. --clh]

the blessed virgin mary appeared to catherine laboure, a nun of the sisters of charity on july 18, 1830 at rue du bac, paris. sister catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5 or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. the child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised the virgin mary was to be found awaiting her. our lady appeared to her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining to her life and to the future of france and the world. on november 27 our lady appeared again to catherine. she instructed her to have a medal struck. she told her that those who wore this medal would enjoy special protection from the mother of god and would receive great graces. in less than a year there were three more apparitions. in june of 1831 the medals were a reality. many reports were received by those who wore it. within two years of its issuing the medal was known as the "miraculous medal". catherine died in 1876. her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). she was canonized on july 27, 1947. her body lies in the chapel at the motherhouse on the rue du bac where she had her first meeting with our lady. the apparition on november 27 1830 was of average height and clothed in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor. above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent god's all knowing wisdom looked down on them. our lady's feet rested on a white globe and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was stepping on. in her hands was a golden ball that represented the world. great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed catherine an image of two hearts, the sacred heart wrapped in piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. the sword represented her suffering with jesus. the apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned that a dark era lay in the immediate future. it was the apparition leading up to the recent ones. our lady began to dispense secrets. and with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute with the forces of the dark. she told catherine "the times are evil. misfortunes will fall upon france. the throne will be overturned. the entire world will be overcome by evils of all kinds." refer to books on st. catherine for more of our lady's messages. a copy of the medal is also available in catholic bookstores. i will post other marian events every few days or so including the ones happening today which are still under investigation. these postings serve only to introduce you to these events. please look more into them and understand the reason for the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- mark ashley |disclaimer: my opinions. not harris' marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com | the lost los angelino |

"if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will i require at thine hand. nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." even though the d&c prefaces this commandment with "parents have children in zion" i believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children whatever good principles they understand. however, lds parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly. a idler

(which, i should say at the outset, i find somewhat plausible; i certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way of construing this problem passage.) i'm going to set aside for the moment the question of whether paul might have coined this usage, to look at the more tractable question of what it means. for this there are, in principle, two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external. that is, we can look at the text of paul's letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that paul might have relied on, or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to paul's meaning. the single worst problem with this word in corinthians is that there is no internal evidence for paul's meaning. he uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him some negative meaning. we are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formation of the word -- which is indeed the reason that de young (and others before him) have associated it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with other men, where verb is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" in leviticus, "bed" in greek). one problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) is not, as far as i know, used that way in greek. therefore, i offer one serious test which de young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected: 	o find a body of greek texts contemporary with paul (or not much 	 prior to his day) such that the _x-koitai_ formation implies 	 "men who have sex with x" [obviously, the "best case" is to 	 find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.] such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way. it is worth emphasizing that compound words are not in general under- standable by projecting what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots. existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or not original with paul in the specific case of x == _arse:n_) possible of comprehension by his readers. my "test" moves in the direction of external evidence. if paul does not in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage) or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering. external evidence, that is, texts other than paul's own and lexicographic or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into the picture. *if* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on paul, which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu- ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one has grounds for 	o denying that paul coined the word and	o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning do you see the problem? if paul coined the word, then he requires his readers to share enough context with him to comprehend his coinage and its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating de young's guess) understand him to be referring to the levitical "universal" prohibition of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where paul has emphasized at least to other congregations (and so one assumes to the corinthians -- how else to explain 1 cor. 6:12, and the corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the non applicability of torah law to his gentile converts!) among the considerations that make it implausible for paul to have coined the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old attic or ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be assimilated as _arre:n_. to me, this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage. what is paul doing inventing a word in obsolete attic formation? and if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no other.) i cannot emphasize enough that paul does not tell us what he means by this word. we (and his original readers) are guessing. they, at least, had a contemporary context -- and maybe paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person. but we have no trace of evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy. so -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word. and it seems to be exceptionally meagre. that is precisely the problem. i can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word: 	a) it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe 	 very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities 	b) it was a term of abuse used by jews about the awful homosexual 	 greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their 	 part with the leviticus passage) 	c) paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an 	 association with leviticus in his doing so. he may or may not 	 intend the word to have an explicit and universal application 	 with absolute and clear boundaries. [since none of his other 	 words in that list have such character, this last seems to me 	 about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses i'm advancing.] of these, i'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but i still have reservations about that, too. if the word never appears before paul, and in later uses has some evidence of depending on paul, then one can opt for paul's coining it. if it does appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places paul traveled.) in either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account paul's relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be from the greek or jewish communities, paul's relations are hardly straight- forward! there is, so far as i have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis. your guess is as good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things). but it remains -- so far -- guesswork. and i don't know about you, but i for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god. by all means be convinced in your own conscience about what paul is getting at -- as he says elsewhere on what was in his day a major controversy of somewhat this same character (romans 14:22-23) 	"hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and god -- and 	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going 	against his conscience. but anybody who eats in a state of doubt 	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done 	in bad faith is a sin." for my part, i cannot see any way to resolve paul's meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty of constraining paul's own intent. paul, like humpty dumpty (and me, and all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices -- and sometimes leave his readers puzzled. if that puzzlement leads you to god, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of paul's words have led some people), then paul's intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences. i have always found paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if i read him "in the large", if i can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again. i am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.) in my usual discursive way, i have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm that paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as the leviticus prohibition. my second point is to *stipulate* this hypo- thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for later christians. given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's meditation :-) -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7

consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh. what therefore god has joined together, let no man separate." matt 19:4-6 (nasb) but because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 1 corinthians 7:4,5 (nasb) > there are plenty of >laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus, most of >which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine >them. they just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and >which ones are "ritual." well, i have news for you. any anthropology >course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories >in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). >and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus >from the "ritual law" which no christian i know feels applies to us. i disagree... every law that is written in leviticus should be looked at as sin. that is why we have a need for a savior. i can understand someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the levitcal law, but i would hope that they would repent when confronted with it. >>i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the >>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. >well, la-ti-da. so what?

do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled. for the land has become defiled, therefore i have visited its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants. but as for you, you are to keep my statutes and judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you leviticus 18:24-26 (nasb) he is the lord... listen to what he has to say... nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals. we do love you, but we don't agree that what you practice is not sin. you have not truly repented of your sin. we hate the sin that is within your lives. i hate sin that is in my life. all christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives. confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. yes i agree with john 3:17, but i also know that jesus said, "repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" matt 3:17. if you don't agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?

the last time we discussed homosexuality, i asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the bible prohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone. put another way, the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that god says it is, with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral. no one could answer my question in either form from the bible. (i did get an interesting response based on roman catholic theology). however, i think now that i can at least answer my first question. link hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one's aunt. incest is held to be immoral in every society, that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage (and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. the bible is no exception. the trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous. societies differ as to how they define incest. genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but all the biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. why can't a man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is dead and that he has "married" her? how does this case differ from the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife. are these two cases parallel? does the bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps that god knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why. p.s. please don't bother writing me to tell me that i am a homophobe, as some did last time. my mind is not made up on these questions. you don't know whether i am homophobic or not. you don't know me. to call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks. -- stan armstrong. religious studies dept, saint mary's university, halifax, n.s. armstrong@husky1.stmarys.ca | att!clyde!watmath!water!dalcs!armstrng

[i don't know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself. the whole point of the trinity is that there's enough of a distinction within god that relationship is possible. this implies some sort of communication. i assume that in their "native" form, the father and son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't involved. but jesus is the incarnation of the son, i.e. the logos made flesh. when he's in a human form, his human actions are limited to human capabilities. so communication with the father takes the form of prayer. i don't see that there's anything problematical about that. it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation. --clh]

(mt. 19:4-6). i read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife (female) is a divinely-ordained union. in other words, the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by god--not by men, and not by the church, but by god. men are not supposed to dissolve this union, in jesus' words, because it is not something created by men. this is not circular reasoning, this is just reading god's word. i read in the bible that god ordained the union of male and female. i do not read of any similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females. granted, there have been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isn't caligula reported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that jesus refers to as "what god has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife. (pardon me for mentioning caligula. i know that's probably inflammatory, and i should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post. please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply.) anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the bible as divinely-ordained, and given a biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful? of course, i see now that first we need to ask whether the bible really condemns sex outside of marriage. you seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and other sins) are really wrong: >>i think we can all agree (with paul) that there are some kinds of >activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or >"reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation. we may >or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very >fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at >all "clear" but that paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest >in making them clear, leaving matters rather to our spirit-led decisions, >with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated >christian discussion of all these areas. alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all the rest was, in paul's day, what we would call a faq; i.e. the law, as the "tutor" appointed by god to lead us to christ, had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of god's people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death. perhaps paul didn't go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600 years he considered the question to have been dealt with already. perhaps the reason god's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct, new testament sexuality was because he did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality he had already established by the law. i'll discuss the law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but i just wanted to point out that the new testament's failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that god does not care about sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality! >homosexual behavior is no different. i (and the other gay christians i >know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and >child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly >"harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- >that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter >you cite [may i mildly suggest that what *paul* does in his letter that >you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?] > > "'i am free to do anything,' you say. yes, but not everything > is for my good. no doubt i am free to do anything, but i for one > will not let anything make free with me."

how do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives? is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior? i think you see that this is circular reasoning: why is it defined as sinful? because it is obsessive. what makes it obsessive? the fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful. or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns? once again, that's circular: why is it defined as obsessive? because the person wants it even though society condemns it. why does society condemn it? because it is obsessive. you seem to be trying to limit the bible's condemnation of "porneia" to only "perverted" sex acts, but i don't think you can really define "perverted" without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of. what, then, is paul condemning when he declares that "fornicators...shall not enter the kindgom of heaven"? >i won't deal with the exegesis of leviticus, except very tangentially. >fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your >assumption that you know what _porneia_ means. i think you misunderstood me: i was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of "porneia", i was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples. >there are plenty of >laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus, most of >which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine >them. they just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and >which ones are "ritual." well, i have news for you. any anthropology >course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories >in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). >and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus >from the "ritual law" which no christian i know feels applies to us. > >i'm dead serious here. when people start going on (as they do in this >matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what >do they know about it, huh?

i am glad you asked. would you agree that if god condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the law of moses, then this would show that god's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law? if i can show you from scripture that god punished the homosexual behavior of people who were *not* under the law of moses, would you agree that god's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the law? i've been having a private email discussion with a 7th day adventist on the subject of the sabbath, and my main point against a christian sabbath-keeping requirement has been that nowhere in scripture does god command gentiles to rest on the sabbath, nor does he ever condemn gentiles for failing to rest on the sabbath. this illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as "thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the (temporary, jews-only) law of moses, such as the sabbath. the point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary, jews-only law of moses. i on the other hand believe that it was labelled by god as an abomination for gentiles as well as jews, and that he punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile. here's why: back in genesis 15, god promises to give abraham all the land that was then in the possession of "the amorite"--kinda hard on the amorite, don't you think? but in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds: it seems god is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the iniquity of the amorite is not yet complete". remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law. what then was the iniquity the amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his being cast out of his own land and/or killed? go back and look at lev. 18 again. verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality. beginning in verse 24, god starts saying, "do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the nations which i am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_. for the land has become defiled, therefore i have visited its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants... for whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people." notice that god says the gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual law of moses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and their land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and homosexuality. flip ahead two chapters to lev. 20, and you will find these same "abominations" listed, and this time god decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying with another man as one lies with a woman" (lv. 20:13). their "bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in god's eyes, they deserved to die for having done such things. according to lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien [non-jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on penalty of being "cut off [by god?] from among their people." under the circumstances, i believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god objected only to the intended rape, and not the homosexuality, in sodom. since god took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay sex), i'd say god was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even by those who had nothing to do with the mosaic covenant. >for those christians who *do* think that *some* parts of leviticus can >be "law" for christians (while others are not even to be thought about) >it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to >determine why you "pick" one and ignore another. according to ii tim. 3:16, all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, i believe that even though we gentile christians are not under the law, we can learn from studying it. if a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the law (for example, in the case of sabbath-keeping). where god reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the law, then i conclude that god's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself. in the case of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by god as a defiling abomination for gentiles as well as jews, i.e. for those who are not under the law as well as for those who are. thus, i am not at all trying to say that gentile christians have any obligation to keep any part of the law, i am simply saying that god referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the law. if this is so, then i do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice god has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both jew and gentile.

what happened to "no doubt i am free to do anything"? i think you have a serious double standard here. when you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about homosexuality. not all people share your view. you claim not to know any sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist. they even have their own newsgroup: alt.sex.bestiality. are you going to accuse them all of being mere "jokers"? i notice you deleted the main point of my comment: the fact that the only biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical prohibitions against homosexuality. while there are some new testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none that condemn bestiality. one of your main points seems to be that christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" new testament statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all? i am quite serious here. if i am going to accept homosexuality as biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then i am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well. if the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well, i'm going to apply them and see what comes up. i'm not trying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous joke". i posted a question about how we should interpret biblical guidelines for christian sexuality, and i don't think such a question is "irrelevant" in a group called "soc.religion.christian". the bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context, and therefore i feel i have a good precedent for doing the same. >jesus and paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, >the central linch-pin of christian moral thought: we are required to >love one another, and all else depends on that. gay and lesbian christ- >ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get >in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues. i don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a side issue for me. i believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine whether god regards certain sexual acts as defiling. i can read in the new testament that "god has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the marriage bed is undefiled. i can read in the old testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the law. if gay christians can validly put aside the old testament standards of defilement, then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days. i don't think it's right to take just bits and pieces of the law and try and apply them to christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't. that was pretty much what you said earlier, right? you used different examples, but i think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the law to christians. >christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every >corner of usenet and the world, and all they ever do is spout these same >old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never >even read), in total ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with >the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can >manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great >emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even >taking the trouble to find out what it is. it was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction. i personally don't get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation; i'm afraid i naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude. please note that i have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse. i have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" nt condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of nt condemnation (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation. >such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ. >why, for god's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to >condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to listen >to before you start your condemnations?

> [quote from john 3:17ff omitted for brevity] this is an excellent question, and i pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer. i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia. why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations? why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals? is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought? a lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse. is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable? a lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable. do you feel that it violates the traditional judeo-christian standard of sexual morality? many people feel that homosexuality does. do you feel the bible condemns it? many people think the bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality. why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality? if you can honestly answer this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality. also please note that i am not in any sense condemning *people*. i am merely pointing out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual *practices* that the bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage. when i say i think adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor? when you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn others"? when you say other christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense? or are you and i both simply taking note about *practices* the bible brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to god? >for long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from >evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and >rejected. some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* >show a sinful shunning of god's light. blessed are those whose spirits >have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified. > >however, we have seen the truth, and the truth is the light of humanity; >and we now know that it is not we who fear the light, but our enemies who >fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow >it with the darkness of false witness against us. >-- >michael l. siemon i say "you are gods, sons of the >mls@panix.com most high, all of you; nevertheless > - or - you shall die like men, and fall >mls@ulysses.att..com like any prince." psalm 82:6-7 i'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs. if you mean that jesus is the truth, and that he accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then i agree. if we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a savior. our salvation in christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, and we can now do whatever we want. nor does christ's grace mean that those who refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant. i am speaking in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality. if the bible calls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for christians to call it sin too. as applied to christian homosexuality, i think the only definitive authority on christian sexuality is the bible. if you make a list of everything the bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, i think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best. the most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the new testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse. that is, from a gay perspective, the most positive thing you can say about the bible's treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it. that's it. jesus declared all foods clean, the council at jerusalem declared that gentiles were not required to keep the ritual law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted christian practice. you have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both jews under the law and gentiles not under the law, and you have some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum total of what the bible says about same-sex intercourse. i can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-i-want- is-ok, and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked. however, i do not think the bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to. in fact, i don't believe it says anything positive about your case at all. yes, i know the verses about loving one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is it? you know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for christians to do, since you say it is wrong for christians to condemn you. therefore, the issue is whether the bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin. even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verses, you are still left with the fact that the only thing the bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not. - mark [actually i don't think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia. i think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality. most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the law. they regard all of lev as not binding on christians. the argument is that there's no way in the text to separate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics. this does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor does it mean that they accept bestiality. it simply means that their sexual ethics does not come from the law, and particularly not from lev. --clh]

[the quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely clear to me what position loren is taking on it. just for clarity, let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic christological heresies -- monothelitism. that's the position that christ's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one will. in most cases (which i think includes this example), it was the human will that was regarded as missing. normally people who talk about christ's human nature as being "impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense. that is, they are using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual english sense of personality. in this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia". personally i think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the logos took on humanity fully. however it has never been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. athanasius). but the quotation above appears to be going farther than even athanasius went, into the realm of the overtly heretical. --clh]
[cont. dr. james deyoung; #3] r. scroggs robin scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word. scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a "hellenistic jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology." the term is derived from lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the lxx juxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents the hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male"). yet he believes that paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of hellenistic jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14). it was invented to avoid "contact with the usual greek terminology" (108). if this is true, scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in greco-roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it. it was meaningless to native-speaking greeks (108). scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from boswell's "learned discussion" (107). yet scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a male" to have a very narrow reference. with the preceding malokoi (i cor 6:9), which scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the active partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108). hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty. it certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109). this is scrogg's interpretation of the term in i tim 1:10 also. the combination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave dealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]" (120). it again refers to that specific form of pederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121). even "serious minded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty. he then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom 1. consequently paul "must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122). we cannot know what paul would have said about the "contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122). in relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in i cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in paul. the form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped. any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent. he concludes that paul "does not care about any specific item in the lists" (104). both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a "catalogue of vices," scroggs argues that the scriptures are "irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129). the "model in today's christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the nt" that "biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate. they should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . " (127). reactions to the new interpretations of arsenokoitai d. wright in more recent years the positions of bailey, boswell, and scroggs have come under closer scrutiny. perhaps the most critical evaluation of boswell's view is that by david wright. in his thorough article, wright points out several shortcomings of boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai. he faults boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as eusebius, the "apostolic constitutions," clement of alexandria, tertullian and origen (127-28). boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the leviticus passages (129). this is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes boswell's claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai). the lxx must mean "a male who sleeps with a male," making arseno- the object. wright also faults boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129). though boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: "no semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms" (131). wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender" (132). it is with boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. for example, aristides' apology (c. ad 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to boswell's discussion. boswell fails to cite hippolytus (refut. omn. haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites eusebius and the syriac writer bardensanes. the latter uses syriac terms that are identical to the syriac of i cor 6:9 and i tim 1:10 (133-34). next wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the greeks (134). sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia ("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136). clement of alexandria in protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the ten commandments as "you shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit adultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with boys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43). another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the sibylline oracles 2:71-73. it may be, wright observes, that the word was coined by a jewish pre-christian writer in a hellenistic setting represented by or.sib., book 2 (137-38). wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century ad writer teucer, in macarius (4th-5th c.), and in john the faster (d. 595) (139-40). the last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to boswell. wright next replies to boswell's contention that the term would not be absent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41). wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century ad since it did not exist before then, that the greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. didache) show no acquaintance with paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing scripture, and that boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). boswell's treatment of chrysostom in particular draws wright's attention (141-44). boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue. chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on rom 1:26. boswell has exaggerated chrysostom's infrequent use of the term. wright observes that boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity" (144). it is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the greco-roman world. wright also surveys the latin, syriac, and coptic translations of i tim and i cor. all three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning "homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45). none of these primary versions supports boswell's limited conclusion based on them. wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form. he believes that such lists developed in late judaism as hellenistic jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the greek world. this paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence. the term came into being under the influence of the lxx (145) so that writers spoke "generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides" (146). if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146). in summary, wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with judaism. the views of boswell, scroggs, and others who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies. [next: the questioning of wrights position by william peterson. after that, we get into the "good" stuff of historical & linguistic studies. this will include "symposium" by plato. if there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of paul, this will certainly clear things up. also we will review paul's use of lev18-20 in the nt and how, as for him, 1) the law was fulfilled, but not done away with, 2) lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the general. those who put forth that the ot no longer holds true today in our culture, should stick around for this one.] ___________________________ 13 r. scroggs, the new testament and homosexuality (phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. independently we came to the same conclusion. apparently the connection is made in e.a. sophocles, greek lexicon of the roman & byzantine periods (from 146bc to ad 1100). 14 see discussion, 101-4. he says the same thing about paul's language in rom 1:26-27 (128). but this is doubtful. see the more cautious words of p. zaas, "i cor 6.9ff: was homosexuality condoned in the corinthian church? sblasp 17 (1979):205-12. he observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai were part of jewish anti-gentile polemic. yet paul's wors at the end of the vice list, "and such were some of you," indicate that "paul is addressing real or potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by rote" (210). wright disputes zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry (147). 15 on boswell's treatment of rom 1:26-7, the article by r.b. hays, "relations natural and unnatural" a response to john boswell's exegesis of romans 1," jre 14/1 (spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique. 16 d.f. wright, "homosexuals or prostitutes? the meaning of arsenokoitai (i cor 6:9, i tim 1:10), vc 38 (1984):125-53. 17 in an unpublished paper, henry mendell, "arsenokoitai: boswell on paul," effectively refutres boswell's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. he finds the meaning to be general, "a male who has sex with a male" (4-11). 18 wright's endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers. 19 we also have noticed the same tendency by boswell to fail to cite all the references to sodom and sodomy in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. see j.b. deyoung, "a critique of prohomosexual interpretations of the ot apocrypha and pseudepigrapha," bsac 146/588 (1990):437-53. 20 in light of the claim made by boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, wright asks pertinently "why neither philo nor josephus use paidofthoria, nor josephus paiderastia, and why . . clement did not use the latter and chrysostom the former?" (152 n. 71) in a more recent article, "homosexuality: the relevance of the bible," evq 61 (1989):291-300, wright reiterates these same points. paul shows a "remarkable originality" in extending the ot ethic to the church (300).

a recent post bears the subject line: > re: serbian genocide work of god? the text contains 80 lines devoted to a defence of the doctrine of predestination as applied to the salvation of individuals. there is then a five-line post-script on the balkans. it is natural and easy to keep the subject line of the post that one is replying to, but when the focus shifts, keeping the same subject can cause confusion. this is intended as a general request. the post mentioned is just the handiest example. yours, james kiefer
meta-exegesis: conviction of sin, part ii let me return to the question, stipulating that paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the levitical prohibition of male-male sex. in order to bring out the problems most clearly, i'll also stipulate (what i think is far less plausible) that paul coined the term for this usage. the question i want to turn to is what that would mean for paul's readers and for later christians. this should be shorter than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within christ's body, and i am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow christians. my own biases (loosely characterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but i am not grinding an axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be hard to reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the gospel of christ. so; stipulating paul's intent, the immediate question is: how can his readers understand this intent? and following on that question, there is a second one: what is our proper action if we *do* manage to understand him? since paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st corinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to this question: +	a. paul (or apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has 	 conveyed to the corinthians the then-traditional jewish condem- 	 nation of homosexual behavior, and paul expects them to be 	 sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no 	 futher explanation. [i should note that there is no evidence 	 in the letter, or in 2 corinthians for such a supposition :-)] +	b. the spirit will teach us what paul means (or, if not paul, 	 what god means "behind" paul's inspired word-choice.) -	c. we *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre- 	 cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by paul, 	 in the same passage of the word _pleonektai_ ("those who have 	 more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from 	 its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word! the neb 	 translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards" 	 -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult, 	 so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!) the three positions more or less -- if i can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical catholic attitude towards tradition, one form of protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical demand for evidence. all three positions have strengths and weaknesses. _ad_ a:	it is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the 	community of christ's disciples and their successors, and that 	our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition. 	but it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this 	tradition until almost a century after paul, which is to say that 	we have access to the tradition only after several generations of 	possibly confused transmission. the scripture is itself our only 	documentation of the tradition in the critical era. _ad_ b:	if we are not born of water and spirit [to revert to john in an 	attempt to explain paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under- 	standing the gospel than nicodemus had; neither the traditions of 	men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit 	from blowing where it will -- the paraclete is a kamikaze. but 	the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit 	as our guide in scripture is that the wing of protestantism that 	takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent 	understanding supposedly derived from the "clear" word of god. 		[note: classical lutheran, calvinist and anglican thought 		constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even 		while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture; 		the more bizarre forms of "i will read scripture my way" 		are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" protestantism.] 	the main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no 	means for one person to convey to another what that one may feel 	*is* teaching received from the spirit; and history shows incredible 	conflict between christians on this point, each in his own mind 	"convinced" that he is led by the spirit. no one can seriously 	urge point b without some sense of its potential for setting christian 	against christian. to what purpose? _ad_ c:	the critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can 	reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open 	to all. the weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually 	possible. :-) 	[if i may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias; 	one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves" 	faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu- 	ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to 	address.] anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between "liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c. a catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that despite horrendous strains rome is not as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the protestant world will. and anglicans will (i predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position its due, but no more than its due. second question. suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual" christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible, that paul is refering to a flat, universal levitical prohibition against male-male sex. what then? again, we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer. but it's precisely where inherited traditions are not questioned that they're most dangerous. we have examples of christ questioning the pharisees and their use of tradition (despite his urging, in matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them). we have examples of peter, and more radically still paul, jettisoning the traditions that they were led by the spirit to call into question. jesus and peter and paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it to radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds: "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith" 							(matthew 23:23) and "on these two commandments [love god & neighbor] hand the whole law, and the prophets, also." 							(matthew 22:40) if there is a fundamental (because derived from christ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the torah to gentile converts (vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from jesus' reported words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge. all traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men. that god may lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction i will freely grant. but tradition is inherently human, and inherently corruptible (and given the fall, corrupt). nothing in it is immune to challenge, when the spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy and good faith. nothing may ultimately stand unless it does follow from love of god and love of neighbor. i am perfectly willing to grant that i could be blind to my own sin. that the spirit may have taught another what she refuses to teach me (or i am too dense to learn). that tradition *might* have value here. but what i *know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious christians appealed to justinian after an earthquake in asia minor, and scapegoated "sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense. if that is in accord with the gospel of christ, then i am no christian. that is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious. and i see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto usenet of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand. if that is the leading of the spirit, then i want no part of it. but what i have found in obedience to the lord is that i am, myself, totally dependent on the witness of other christians, for the truth that lives in the body of christ. and i say to all who doubt that gay christianity is from god what gamaliel said to doubting pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest church: 	"be careful how you deal with these people... if this enterprise, 	this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of 	its own accord; but if it does in fact come from god you will not 	only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves 	fighting against god." 							[acts 5:36...39] all i ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures with a mind and soul open to the spirit, and to the past history of our first christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and other readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor. then, study the evidence; learn the history of christians oppressing christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where jesus and paul tell us not to judge. and let the witness of the spirit in the lives of your fellow christians -- including those who are not of your preference in theology -- guide you towards god's truth. -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7 [there's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to whether you're speaking of tradition in paul's time or ours. i think there are two ways to use tradition. one is to say that when paul and his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition. that's what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly. we know that paul came out of a background that was rather puritanical on sex. everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background. the tone of his remarks on homosexuality in rom 1 is consistent with that background. even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that paul shares the common jewish rejection of homosexuality. but when you identify (a) with the catholic position, that's rather a horse of a different color. the catholic position involves a continuing church tradition. arguments specific to that tradition might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret paul's original meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the church fathers interpreted him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours. i think this is a somewhat different use of tradition. a radical protestant might be willing to use known 1st cent. tradition to illuminate paul's original meaning, but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be. --clh]

there is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the mormon writings. in the book in the book of mormon called the book of jacob, joseph smith wrote that it was an abomination to god for david and solomon to have many wives. later, when joseph smith wrote the doctrines and covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for david to have many wives. how do mormons answer this contradiction? link hudson.

''woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh" if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of god, must needs come but which, having continued through his appointed time, he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him ? fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet, if god wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the lord, are true and righteous altogether" with malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations. -- ___ bill rea (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--u--w--- | bill rea, computer services centre, | e-mail b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | university of canterbury, | or cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | christchurch, new zealand | phone (03)-642-331 fax (03)-642-999 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(note: christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda). you may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation, but i would argue that it's at least relevant. you can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't look at the incest association, because in fact there is no such association. if there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at it too. of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way. part of why there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results. --clh]

now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart. ipeter 1:22
i have been studying the bible now for about a year. i love it, but i am not very familiar with the different denominations, or traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups. i have heard various people (outside this news group) describe *idols* such as power, money, material possessions etc. these things are worshiped in some sense i suppose, but i never really gave idols much thought. until now... i have been reading the postings in this news group (which i just found a few days ago), and i have a question... first, i'm not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views on anyone else (i haven't been at this long enough to have any views other than i cannot get to heaven by being good, i must understand that christ bore my sins on the cross so that i could be saved and i need to repent, i.e. realize that every time i sin, i might as well stick a sharp stick in christ's side because he took the punishment for my sins, when he died on the cross). in my studies, mary never really comes up. i know who she is, but that's about it. it seems to me that a statue of mary could be considered an idol? do people pray to statues of mary? it sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself i'm sure) believe mary was sinless? wow... i hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about tongues (i'm reading "charismatic chaos"). i guess i'll study tongues in parallel with reading this news group. any help you can give me will be appreciated. ------------------------------------------- [i don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a different tradition than yours. this is a discussion between catholics and protestants. catholics generally believe that mary was sinless. protestants do not. the issue comes down to different sources of authority. protestants generally limit themselves to the bible as a source of doctrine. since this isn't in the bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), protestants don't accept it. catholics see continuing revelation through the church, though they believe the results are consistent with the bible. i interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about whether the catholic marian devotions are idolatry (an argument i am not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own. catholics are of course a major one, but by no means the only one. i generally consider the major traditions to be catholic, orthodox, and various subsets of protestantism. within protestantism, it's a matter of how finely you want to cut things. these days i think the major division is between those who accept biblical inerrancy and those who don't. there are also a number of major historical traditions, but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur. i'd identify the major protestant traditions as: lutheran, reformed, anglican (they're sort of halfway between catholic and protestant), wesleyan, baptist, holiness, pentecostal, church of christ but there are a number of others. historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and i think current trends in society and the church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical" perspective. but differences among these various traditions are still quite marked. i think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history. anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now. a church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and give a feeling for their nature. unfortunately i'm away from my library at the moment, so i don't have anything specific to recommend. --clh]

i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the "homosexual" issue and the "atheist" issue. please take no offense at these comparisons. the homosexual "feels" things that i admit i do not "feel". he learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences. that is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation. models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded. however, one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates his model. if that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel. the christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not feel. the christian accepts the christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean. once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his christianity. as a reminder, i am a christian, a catholic, i don't hate homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand them. i only compare them because they are both so foreign to me. am i as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me? or am i as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against attempts by society to deny his sexuality? or am i just out to lunch, again? chris mussack

(note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the congregation is very important here - this year is the 150th annivarsary of the disruption, where the church split on that very issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years). a couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained. in theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his session, or refused to work with a woman minister in presbytery, could be disciplined. in practice this has not happened, and i believe it is unlikely to happen. my personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation worked very well. we are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly. at this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of same-sex couples (after an edinburgh minister did so). our panel on doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year - the matter will be considered and debated then. hope this is interesting alison

continuing part #4 (i think); used by permission, the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai, with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b. deyoung w. petersen more recently wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction. in a brief 1986 study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word "homosexuals" as the meaning of arsenokoitai.[22] he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by "homosexuals" in i cor 6:9 and i tim 1:10. in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey, boswell, and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of bailey. he finds "homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic. "a major disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul's time (187-88). what is this "disjunction"? he bases it on historical and linguistic facts. accordingly, ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" in describing these actions. ancient society know nothing of the categories of "homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen, "everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23] in contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual" to desire and propensity. k.m. benkert, who in 1869 coined the german term equivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse or affectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189). petersen then proceeds to cite the "supplement to the oxford english dictionary," which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts. petersen's point is that by using "homosexuals" for arsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history "where no equivalent concept existed" (189). consequently the translation is inaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes female homosexuals" (19=89). prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure, either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence" (189). the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio "homosexual" is mistaken. yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds? the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen's position. the justification for translating arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence. since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul's usage, no historical settings earlier than his are available. yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul. the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to present-day concepts. peterson, bailey, boswell, and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be part of the definition of the term. they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind (boswell, active male prostitutes; scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times (bailey; petersen). the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate. attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under "linguistic grounds." in regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the homosexual condition exist before 1869? is it only a modern phenomenon? yet if it is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including ancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-christian and christian, not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of same-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex orientation or condition. petersen admits (190 n. 10) that plato in "symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancient ingnorance of this condition. he discounts this, however, believing that even here "acts appear to be the deciding factor." however, this is a very significant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition. the "symposium" of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition. [24] plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). hence "original nature" palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings. zeus sliced these human beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods. consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex. plato then quotes aristophances: each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two; and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him. all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are woman-courters; our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex, whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses. all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men: they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions. men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men's embrasces; these are the finest boys and striplings, for they have the most manly nature. some say they are shameless creatures, but falsely: for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome their like. sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men. so when they come to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom; they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days. a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind. well, when one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be induced to leave each other's side for a single moment. these are they who continue together throughout life, though they could not even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25] should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live, or even in hades, aristophanes says that each "would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time: (192e). several observations about this text are in order. lesbianism is contemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e). "natural interest" (ton noun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. the words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: (paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "to be born this," i.e., as homosexual. the idea of mutuallity ("the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) is present. aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). the concept of permanency ("these are they who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present. further mention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty, homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is recognizable. clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from actions. the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial; money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). they mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e). there are tow kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion" (186b-d). the speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), the desires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c). noteworthy is the speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects (200a-201c). desire is felt for "what is not provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack." this is the object of desire and love. socrates clearly distinguishes between "what sort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e). this ancient philosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature. his wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26] in summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato. petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not inclination or orientation. widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter. [27] biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction. in rom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desires of the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove paul's concern for disposition and inclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). even the catologues of vices are introdiced (i tim 1:8-10) or concluded (i cor 6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do." habits betray what people are within, as also the lord jesus taught (cf. matt. 23:28). the inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise to the other (cf. mt 5:27). petersen errs regarding other particulars too. transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients. it was practiced among canaaniteds, syrian, people of asia minor, as well as greeks, according to s.r. driver. [28] only a few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it. for example, seneca (moral epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman. philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women (the special laws iii, 37-41; see also his on the virtues, 20-21, where he justifies prohibition of cross-dressing). even the ot forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes (deut 22:5). petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the "new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior. these did not begin with paul (rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient greece and even non-christian contemporaries used them. plato, the test.naph., philo, josephu, plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts.

ok, let me see if i can get all this out concisely. i am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of christianity/churches there are. my husband and i come from very different, but completely christian backgrounds. i was a lutheran when i met him and he was a born and raised church of christ member. at first i agreed with a lot of what the c of c was about, i wanted to move from the liturgical based lutheran church to something a little more biblical based. however over the last year, i've been regretting changing to the church of christ for a number of reasons - for one thing i am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the bible are socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the christian doctrine. one of my sorest spots is the role of women. i believe that through mary and other women, chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the c of c the writings of paul are taken without exception and i am told that i am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, i am to submit to my husband in all things (if i hear that verse one more time....) and i am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting bible studies etc). the last straw was when the elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a real christian (i got told that nobody who voted for clinton should call themselves a christian). hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with. we are also don't agree with the c of c's dread of any new "movement" being led by the young people. so, we have been church hunting with no success. i want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( c of c really looked down on career women). christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their bibles to service. we are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation. if anyone can point us in a direction we'd be thrilled! i'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and even harder for me to stay churchless for long. any responses would be welcome the diel family [i would think somewhere in the baptist spectrum you might find what you're looking for. however the issue is probably more one of the flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the denomination -- baptists cover quite a spectrum. adult baptism sort of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum. historically that's been associated with movements that have the character you're trying to avoid. --clh]

[p. 199] there is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh". nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of sodom is the sin of homosexuality. the only place that the sin of sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in ezekiel 16:49 "this was the guilt of your sister sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, bit did not aid the poor and needy. they were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore i removed them when i saw it. for the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly. there are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se. revdak@netcom.com

hello. i just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country. i am not sure if it is going on also here in the us or any other country. in all these 4 1/2 yrs. i've been here in illinois, usa, i have not encountered it. may i just call it "traveling fatima" since i don't know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language. for certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/ statue of our lady of fatima is moved from one home (originating from owner) to another. this will stay with that family for one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our lady of fatima. the move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing' prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move. there will be the 'receiving' prayers at the next home to welcome our lady of fatima image there. it does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image. they may invite others (or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week. this image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner of the image. this is probably going on around there (philippines) right now (or somebody correct me when exactly since i forgot) and every year, this is part of our devotion to our lady of fatima. it has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a catholic and the image then is just moved next door. i am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives. most of our friends and neighbors there are catholics and practicing ones. i'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this practice will violate, whatsoever, before i go for it. thank you for any comments or help about this matter. -- -marida (maridai@ecs.comm.mot.com)

just a quick comment. as a baptist clergyperson, i find the idea of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and they seldom are regarding religion) offensive. the pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent. we do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert. if in fact the grace of god might work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or two. baptist believe in regenerate membership. did this church include these half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose? this kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not very christian, either. revdak@netcom.com

you forgot one thing "all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god". mark
dear fellow christians, 	i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which i am in. we had a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam. and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan. i said, "what??" i did not believe that, because i have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice, even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them (in my point of view, they don't sin as much as i do). how come if they were under satan, they could have such personalities. to tell you the truth, i don't know much about islam. but i know that they believe in god, they believe in the day of judgement. 	 	now i'm asking you what your opinions about islam and its teaching. important : i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not. 	 i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam. p.s: i post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian, and bit.listserv.catholic. in christ, our lord, smile......... 					 jesus loves you....... 	tabut torsina 	torsina@enuxhb.eas.asu.edu	 [let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam, since there's a group for that. but i suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam. indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-christians are saved is at the heart of it. the classic christian view, which i think most people believed until the last century or so, was that christianity (and of course judaism) was the only religion founded by god, and that all other religions worshipped false gods, and came from satan. this is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians (and possibly jews) will be saved. this need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are intentionally satanic. after all, in order to be an effective snare, satanic alternatives would have to be attractive. thus they might contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights. they would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through christ. if this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and i suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily relevant. the point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with it. it may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners may all be wonderful people. but if salvation requires being a follower of christ, it could still be a satanic invention. this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position. christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and nice. those are good things, and we should encourage them. but no one is able to do them enough to be saved. salvation requires christ. (please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms. there's a catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in different terms.) a religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways. but if it doesn't have christ, it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying. let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position. what i'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues. indeed it is now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other religions are satanic. most christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past. this is part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental god. christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to christianity. whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves. --clh]

not to change the subject, but how was fr. gobbi allowed at notre dame? notre dame is an anti catholic university. was this allowed to show that the crackpots at notre dame believe in freedom of speech? i am glad that they did allow him to speak. mike
easy vs. hard .....easy on who? i had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year. she said that when she and my father were raising we four children, they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their norwegian lutheran community. they felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems. in other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. they raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances. what happened was that i grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes. i believed in a loving god, and my concept of god never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that i may someday be held responsible for the things that offended him...sins that the "world" told me were ok. my parents are very good, honest and moral people. they raised four extremely honest children. yet, before coming to a more complete knowledge of god (which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment)i committed what i now believe to be many, many grave sins. i lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change...but i shouldn't have married to person in the first place ) and more.... my parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel. today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they *did* accept without a word. it takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear. you must be able to say what is hard, and say it as christ would, with love and compassion. it involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you. this life is "but dust". as long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority, we will fail god and fail those with whom we come in contact. i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who support the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality, or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving friend that these things are *wrong*. no one ever told me that what i was doing was wrong, and i saw multitudes around me living the same way i was and they seemed like good, decent people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..) it is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the holy spirit than it is to hear a loving friend. think about this the next time the holy spirit tells you that a friend is in error, but you don't want to "cause trouble". righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are we are christ's lips and hands on earth. don't be afraid to simply voice truth when the situation calls for it. say a fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance. in more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's keeper. in jesus and mary, elizabeth
