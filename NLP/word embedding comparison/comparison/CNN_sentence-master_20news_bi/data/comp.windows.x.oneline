(see guidelines for more info) x x	* you may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending x	 it to the contest email address. be sure to set 'fix' in the x	 ---entry--- section to 'n'. the corrected entry must use the same x	 title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected. be x	 sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. x x	* with the exception of the header, all text outside of the above x	 format may be ignored by the judges. if you need tell the judges x	 something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate x	 email message to the judges. x x	* information from the ---author--- section will be published unless x	 'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. x x	* to credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for x	 each author. each should start with ---author--- line, and x	 should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. x x	* the entry's remarks should include: x	 - what this program does x	 - how to run the program (sample args or input) x	 - special compile or execution instructions, if any x	 - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) x	 - information about any ---data--- files x	 - why you think the program is obfuscated x	 - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. x	 - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) x x	* do not rot13 your entry's remarks. you may suggest that certain x	 portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. x x * info files should be used only to supplement your entry. they x	 should not be required to exist. x x	 if your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- x	 section. if your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple x	 ---info--- sections, one per info file. you should describe x	 each info file in the ---remark--- section. x x 4) if your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: x x	 'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed x	 'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional x	 digit, followed by '.c' x	 your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's x	 title, possibly followed by a digit x x if your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your x entry's remark section. the makefile will be arranged to execute a x build shell script containing the 'build' information. the name of x this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed x by a digit, followed by '.sh'. x x if needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must x be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. x x 5) the build file, the source and the resulting executable should be x treated as read-only files. if your entry needs to modify these files, x it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file. if this x occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. x x 6) entries that cannot be compiled by an ansi c compiler will be rejected. x use of common c (k&r + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not x cause compile errors for ansi c compilers. x x 7) the program must be of original work. all programs must be in the x public domain. all copyrighted programs will be rejected. x x 8) entries must be received prior to 07-may-93 0:00 utc.

x	j;		 <-- don't use such implicit type declaration x	int k; x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you x must use non-ansi c, such as k&r c, you must avoid areas that result in x compile/link errors for ansi c compilers. x x unfortunately, ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type. x thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: x x	int i; x	char *c; x	i[c];		 <--- use c[i] instead x	(i+3)["string"]; <--- use "string"[i+3] instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments, be careful. systems implement va_list as a wide variety x of ways. because of this, a number of operations using va_list are x not portable and must not be used: x x	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable x	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable x	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg x	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg x	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables x	* using va_list as a structure or union x x in particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. x x avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. x x if you use c preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), x the leading '#' must be the first character on a line. while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. x x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries x must not assume that it returns an int. x x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for x programs that are compact, and are instructional. x x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. x x we tend to dislike programs that: x x	* are very hardware specific x	* are very os or un*x version specific x	 (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific x	 code is likely not to be) x	* dump core or have compiler warnings x	 (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) x	* won't compile under both bsd or sys v un*x x	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit x	* obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs x	* are longer than they need to be x	* are similar to previous winners x	* are identical to previous losers :-) x x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out, x but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -d's in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint. x x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. x x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) x know of a smaller one! x x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend x on color or a given size. don't require backing store. x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a). x don't use m*tif, xv*ew, or openl*ok toolkits, since not everyone x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better x yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems. x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines x in the ---remark--- section. x x we like programs that: x x	* are as concise and small as they need to be x	* do something at least quasi-interesting x	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) x	* are portable x	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x	* make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x	* make us laugh and/or throw up :-) x x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several x areas really does help. x x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well. x x be creative! x x xentry format: x x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format, x in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself. (see judging process) x x we have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry.c: x x	this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases, x	where this program differs from the contest rules, the x	contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the x	contest rules before submitting an entry. x x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient, however, x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules. x x if you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about x the mkentry.c program, please send email to the judges.

(some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt0) the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime() in the c locale. an example of such a string is: x x	thr apr 01 00:47:00 1993 x x this format is similar to the output of the date(1) command. the x string does not include the timezone name before the year. on many x systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: x x	date -u "+%a %h %d %t 19%y" x	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' x	sh -c 'tz=utc date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x	sh -c 'tz=gmt date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x	sh -c 'tz=gmt0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x x you are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry. to do so, set x the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced. x x xjudging process: x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll. x x entries are unpacked into individual directories. the email message x is unpacked into individual files, each containing: x x	---entry--- section x	all ---author--- sections x	all ---info--- sections x	---build--- section x	---program--- section x	any other text, including the email message headers x x prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly). information from the x ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is x complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. x x the above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular x individual. we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given. we like the surprise of finding x out in the end, who won and where they were from. x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. x because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all x attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. we remove all non-winning x files, and shred all related paper. by tradition, we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received. (for the curious, x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks) x x after the usenix announcement, we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries. one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry. they are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos. we x often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. during a round, x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; x the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does x not. we also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round. thus, an entry gets at least two readings. x x a reading consists of a number of actions: x x	* reading the ---entry--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any x	* passing the source thru the c pre-processor x	 shipping over any #include files x	* performing a number of c beautify/cleanup edits on the source x	* passing the beautified source thru the c pre-processor x	 shipping over any #include files x x in later rounds, other actions are performed: x x	* linting the source x	* compiling/building the source x	* running the program x	* performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it x does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form x award categories. entries begin to compete with each other for awards. x an entry often will compete in several categories. x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive. a typical category list might be: x x	* best small one line program x	* best small program x	* strangest/most creative source layout x	* most useful obfuscated program x	* best game that is obfuscated x	* most creatively obfuscated program x	* most deceptive c code x	* best x client (see our likes and dislikes) x	* best abuse of ansi c x	* worst abuse of the rules x	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> x x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example, a few entries are so x good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. x we will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. x x in the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round, is x less clear cut. x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out x by a similar, but slightly better entry. for this reason, it is x sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes, of course, x that the entry is worth improving in the first place! x x more often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a x strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way. x x in the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often, the x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. x x xannouncement of winners: x x the first announcement, occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition, x this is done during the latter part of the uunet/ioccc bof, just prior to x the berkeley bsd, and bsdi bof. x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups: x x	 comp.lang.c		 comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources x x in addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x	 comp.sources.d	 alt.sources.d		misc.misc x	 comp.sources.misc	 comp.windows.x x x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see x below for details. x x often, winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners x have appeared in books ("the new hackers dictionary") and on t-shirts. x x last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!

---------------------------------------------------------------------- in brief, xlib, xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections. any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc. note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt; the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions. the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler. this flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback. it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler. as another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes. this effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called. another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using xtappaddinput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. however, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. why don't the intrinsics deal with this problem? primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system. is that a good enough reason -- i don't think so. note: the article in the x journal 1:4 and the example in o'reilly volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. how do i use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- this requires a more complicated answer than it should. a window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap. all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource; only shell widgets have visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a visual). the default value of these resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says. in the shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen. when any one of the three resources is not properly set, a badmatch error occurs when the window is created. they are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used. how to get this to work? there are two parts to the answer. the first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual. the second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available. the first is a little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /* * some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * to compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lxaw -lxmu -lxt -lxext -lx11 -lm * * to run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual staticcolor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */ #include <x11/intrinsic.h> #include <x11/stringdefs.h> #include <x11/shell.h> typedef struct { 	visual	*visual; 	int	depth; } optionsrec; optionsrec	options; xtresource resources[] = { 	{"visual", "visual", xtrvisual, sizeof (visual *), 	xtoffsetof (optionsrec, visual), xtrimmediate, null}, 	{"depth", "depth", xtrint, sizeof (int), 	xtoffsetof (optionsrec, depth), xtrimmediate, null}, }; xrmoptiondescrec desc[] = { 	{"-visual", "*visual", xrmoptionseparg, null}, 	{"-depth", "*depth", xrmoptionseparg, null} }; int main (argc, argv) 	int		argc; 	char		**argv; { 	xtappcontext	app;		/* the application context */ 	widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ 	display		*dpy;		/* display */ 	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ 	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ 	colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ 	xvisualinfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ 	xvisualinfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ 	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ 	arg		args[10]; 	cardinal	cnt; 	char		*name = "test"; 	char		*class = "test"; 	/* 	 * save the command line arguments 	 */ 	xargc = argc; 	xargv = (char **) xtmalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); 	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *)); 	/* 	 * the following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can 	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. 	 */ 	cnt = 0; 	top = xtappinitialize (&app, class, desc, xtnumber (desc), &argc, argv, 			 (string *) null, args, cnt); 	dpy = xtdisplay (top); 	cnt = 0; 	xtgetapplicationresources (top, &options, resources, 				 xtnumber (resources), 				 args, cnt); 	cnt = 0; 	if (options.visual && options.visual != defaultvisualofscreen (xtscreen (top))) 	{ 		xtsetarg (args[cnt], xtnvisual, options.visual); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * now we create an appropriate colormap. we could 		 * use a default colormap based on the class of the 		 * visual; we could examine some property on the 		 * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could 		 * do all sorts of things... 		 */ 		colormap = xcreatecolormap (dpy, 					 rootwindowofscreen (xtscreen (top)), 					 options.visual, 					 allocnone); 		xtsetarg (args[cnt], xtncolormap, colormap); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * now find some information about the visual. 		 */ 		vinfo.visualid = xvisualidfromvisual (options.visual); 		vinfo_list = xgetvisualinfo (dpy, visualidmask, &vinfo, &count); 		if (vinfo_list && count > 0) 		{ 			xtsetarg (args[cnt], xtndepth, vinfo_list[0].depth); 			++cnt; 			xfree ((xpointer) vinfo_list); 		} 	} 	xtdestroywidget (top); 	/* 	 * now create the real toplevel widget. 	 */ 	xtsetarg (args[cnt], xtnargv, xargv); ++cnt; 	xtsetarg (args[cnt], xtnargc, xargc); ++cnt; 	top = xtappcreateshell ((char *) null, class, 				applicationshellwidgetclass, 				dpy, args, cnt); 	/* 	 * display the application and loop handling all events. 	 */ 	xtrealizewidget (top); 	xtappmainloop (app); 	return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user. if you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension (or some such). why? no application runs in isolation. depending on the way a server allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications. i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome. as an example, on a low end color sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 truecolor. the sgi iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit truecolor, 24 bit truecolor, an overlay plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. why do only shell widgets have a visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- this is strictly by convention. it makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. a widget can have its own visual resource. if it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls xcreatewindow(). you should also make this a resource that can be obtained with xtgetvalues() so other widgets can find it. a reasonable value is probably xtnvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. which visual, depth and colormap do shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent. this is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen(), defaultdepthofscreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree. if the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. i've done all the above and i still get a badmatch error. why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- some resource converters improperly cache references. this was especially true of x11r3 and earlier versions of motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. why doesn't my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- see section 2.8 of the xt specification. it eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately. the intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process. first it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed. this way any pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed. the second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next x event. at this point the list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among other things. as some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list. if so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately. also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated x resources, etc. (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget): 	widget 	toplevelget (gw) 		widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		widget		top; 		for (top = gw; xtparent (top); top = xtparent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	} 	void 	exitcallback (gw, closure, call_data) 		widget		gw;		/* widget */ 		xtpointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 		xtpointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		widget		toplevel; 		toplevel = toplevelget (gw); 		xtunmapwidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		xtdestroywidget (toplevel); 		exit (0); 	} one can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget. the trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur. this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state. you might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget. which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the destroy callbacks. one alternative is to modify exitcallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop. however, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices. try the following code instead. 	#include <x11/intrinsic.h> 	extern widget toplevelget ( 	#if needfunctionprototypes 		widget		gw 	#endif 	); 	extern boolean exitworkproc ( 	#if needfunctionprototypes 		xtpointer	closure 	#endif 	); 	extern void exitcallback ( 	#if needfunctionprototypes 		widget		gw, 		xtpointer	closure, 		xtpointer	call_data 	#endif 	); 	widget 	toplevelget (gw) 	widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		widget		top; 		for (top = gw; xtparent (top); top = xtparent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	} 	void 	exitcallback (gw, closure, call_data) 	widget		gw;		/* widget */ 	xtpointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 	xtpointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		widget		toplevel; 		toplevel = toplevelget (gw); 		xtunmapwidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		xtdestroywidget (toplevel); 		xtappaddworkproc (xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (gw), 				 exitworkproc, (xtpointer) null); 	} 	boolean 	exitworkproc (closure) 		xtpointer	closure; 	{ 		exit (0); 		/*notreached*/ 	} exitcallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. how do i resize a shell widget? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- after it is realized, one doesn't resize a shell widget. the proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget using xtsetvalues(). the geometry change is then propagated to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request. however, the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize. to change the position of a shell, use xtsetvalues() on the shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. why can't xtappaddinput() handle files? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- it does, however unix semantics for when i/o is ready for a file does not fit most peoples' intuitive model. in unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block. this works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes. for a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an eof -- i.e. no more data. the result is the code in the intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read. the culprit is the select() system call or on sysv based os's it is the poll() system call. how to get around this on a unix system? the best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file. use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput(). a suitable program on bsd systems is "tail -f filename". it's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable. in particular: 	- ibm aix 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while 	 (several thousand times) and then stop until some other 	 event woke it up. this seemed to be the result of a race 	 condition in the kernel. ibm claims to have a fix for this. 	- pyramid, doesn't work at all. 	- ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as 	 sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing 	 side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it 	 all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at 	 a time. you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks 	 (get raound it by detecting the situation and having 	 select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had 	 been given the whole block). note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc. this is an os dependent area and may not be identical on all systems. however the intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit. why they didn't also deal with signals at this point i don't know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. what good books and magazines are there on xt? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- i have a favorite that is the definitive reference. to my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the intrinsics. when i started using it i was already familiar with xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful. i've always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages. asente, paul j., and swick, ralph r., "x window system toolkit, the 	complete programmer's guide and specification", digital press, 	1990, isbn 1-55558-051-3, order number ey-e757e-dp; and by 	prentice-hall, isbn 0-13-972191-6. also available through dec 	direct at 1-800-digital. the other book i commonly recomend to novices is: young, doug. "the x window system: applications and programming with 	xt (motif version)," prentice hall, 1989 (isbn 0-13-497074-8). 	(isbn 0-13-972167-3) and of course o'reilly has an entire series of manuals on x and xt. o'reilly ordering is 800-998-9938. in particular, volume 5 is an xt reference done in manual page style. the 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the mit manual pages. i'm finding it very useful. in particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information. i read two periodicals, "the x resource" and the "the x journal". these are the only two dealing specifically with x. "the x resource" is published quarterly, by o'reilly, with one of the issues being the mit x consortium technical conference proceedings. there is no advertising. i've found it informative with pretty good depth. for orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com. for editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com. table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in tex form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ascii form. "the x journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. the articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience. i read it more to see what's going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, i represent a fairly small percentage of people). also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists. call (908) 563-9033. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. what widgets are available? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- there are three popular widget sets: athena	- the set provided with x11. this is sufficient for most 	 purposes but is on the ugly side. recently, a 3d look is 	 available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xaw3d.tar.z. motif	- from osf available for a license fee and commonly shipped on 	 many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but 	 sun). it looks good and works well but personally i think 	 it is poorly implemented. olit	- the open look intrinsics toolkit is a set of widgets 	 implementing sun's open look specification. developed by 	 at&t. i've never used it so can't comment on its quality. 	 i've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get. in addition the following collection of widgets are also available: xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from graphical software 	 technology (310-328-9338). it includes bar graph, stacked 	 bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, 	 spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets. i've never seen 	 them so i can't comment. fwf	- the free widget foundation is attempting to collect a set of 	 freely available widgets. included are a pixmap editor, 	 filedialog, and a few others. the current set of widgets 	 can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine 	 a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.z. xcu	- the cornell university widgets from gene dykes. one of the 	 early widget sets released. provides a nice appearance for 	 buttons and has a mini command language. probably not so 	 widely used. xs	- the sony widget set. this was around during r3 days but 	 seemed to disappear. it looked like it had promise. xw	- the hp widgets. the precursor to motif. originally written 	 for r3 there exists diffs to get it to work under r4 & r5. 	 again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. 	 the precursor to this was the xray toolkit which was 	 originally implemented for x10r4 and apparently provided 	 much experience for the designers of xt. xo	- a widget set i'm working on. it's still primitive but you 	 can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/xo/* the following specialized widgets are also available: tbl	- implements a tabular layout of widgets. supports motif 	 widgets as children. part of wcl. plots	- the athena plotting widgets (not the athena widgets). 	 contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@athena.mit.edu. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. what alternatives to the intrinsics are there? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	__________________________________________ 	name		language	vendor 	__________________________________________ 	xview		c		sun 	oi		c++		parcplace 	interviews	c++		stanford 	tcl/tk		c		sprite.berkeley.edu 	__________________________________________ however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language. keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than c _starts_ gaining acceptance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- first, what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is (essentially) 	typdef struct 	{	 	 string	name; 	 long	value; 	} arg; and the code: 	arg	arg; 	xtsetarg (arg, "name", 3.2) expands to 	arg	arg; 	arg.name = "name"; 	arg.value = 3.2; you can see that with normal c type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2". when the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value. so, how to get around this? the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now recomending it over the previous suggestions. #define xtsetfloatarg(arg, n, d) \ if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(xtargval)) { \ xtsetarg(arg, n, &(d)); \ } else { \ xtargval *ld = (xtargval *)&(d); \ xtsetarg(arg, n, *ld); \ } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. how do i write a resource converter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- courtesy of rich thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com): the following discussion of resource converters assumes r4 (or r5) intrinsics. resource converters changed between r3 and r4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values. there are several main types of resource converters: string to data type data type to string data type to data type i) string to data type usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values. this is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values: 	name		value 	"true"		1 	"false"		0 in this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings. this is most readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the resource manager. the resource value is turned into a quark, which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word. then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values. if there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks. that way, the first time one of these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters. ii) data type to string this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary. instead, the data type value is simply converted to a string value, probably by the use of sprintf. data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file. this mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state into a file. this snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms. if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to string converter. writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent. iii) data type to data type this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type. for instance, an x pixel value can be converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for red, green and blue. the type signature for a resource converter is as follows: typedef boolean (*xttypeconverter)(display *, xrmvalueptr, cardinal *, 	xrmvalueptr, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer *); display *dpy; xrmvalueptr args; cardinal *num_args; xrmvalueptr fromval; xrmvalueptr toval; xtpointer *converter_data; when the converter is invoked, the "fromval" argument points to the source x resource manager value and the "toval" argument points to the destination x resource manager value. the "converter_data" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered. the "args" and "num_args" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked. for instance, the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel. care must be taken with the "toval" argument. an xrmvalue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value: typedef struct { unsigned int size; caddr_t addr; } xrmvalue, *xrmvalueptr; when the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be null. in the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value. if the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return false. the caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter. if the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return true. if the location is null, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return true. when writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro: #define done(var, type) \ if (toval->addr) \ 	{ \ 	 if (toval->size < sizeof(type)) \ 	 { \ 	 toval->size = sizeof(type); \ 	 return false; \ 	 } \ 	 else \ 	 *((type *) toval->addr) = var; \ 	} \ else \ 	toval->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \ toval->size = sizeof(type); \ return true; #define donestr(str) \ if (toval->addr && toval->size < sizeof(string)) \ 	{ \ 	 toval->size = sizeof(string); \ 	 return false; \ 	} \ else \ 	toval->addr = (caddr_t) str; \ toval->size = sizeof(string); \ return true; inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly. once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the intrinsics. the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database. to register a converter with a single application context, use xtappsettypeconverter: void xtappsettypeconverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor) xtappcontext context; string from; string to; xttypeconverter converter; xtconvertarglist args; cardinal num_args; xtcachetype cache; xtdestructor destructor; to register a converter with all application contexts, use xtsettypeconverter: void xtsettypeconverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor) string from; string to; xttypeconverter converter; xtconvertarglist args; cardinal num_args; xtcachetype cache; xtdestructor destructor; in the r3 intrinsics, there were the routines xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter; these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter. whenever possible, the newer routines should be used. when a converter is registered with the intrinsics, a "cache" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached: xtcachenone		don't cache any converted values xtcacheall		cache all converted values xtcachebydisplay	cache converted values on a per display basis caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to pixel conversions). the "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed. xtdestructor has the following type definition: typedef void (*xtdestructor)(xtappcontext, xrmvalueptr, xtpointer, 	xrmvalueptr, cardinal *); xtappcontext context; xrmvalueptr to; xtpointer converter_data; xrmvalueptr args; cardinal *num_args; the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the "to" argument itself (to->addr). the destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered. sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit r5 distribution: mit/lib/xt/converters.c contrib/lib/pext/converters.c contrib/lib/pext/converters.h ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. how do i open multiple displays? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- see "multi-user application software using xt", the x resource, issue 3, (summer 1992) by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved. most of this answer is based on that article. in a nutshell, one uses xtopendisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then xtclosedisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context. the real problems occur when trying to close down a display. this can happen 3 ways: 	1. user selects a "quit" button on one of the displays, 	2. user has window manager send a wm_delete_window message, 	3. server disconnect -- possibly from a killclient message, 	 server shutdown/crash, or network failure. i'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that display. if not, then read the oliver jones article. the third one is difficult to handle. the following is based on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult problem. the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an i/o error is always unrecoverable and so fatal. this is essentially true for a single display x based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an x server. when an x i/o error occurs the i/o error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens. the only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the i/o error handler. the following code fragment demonstrates this: #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf xiorecover; void xiohandler (dpy) 	display		*dpy; { 	destroydisplay (dpy); 	longjmp (xiorecover, 1); } main () { 	... 	if (setjmp (xiorecover) == 0) 		xsetioerrorhandler (xiohandler); 	xtappmainloop (app_context); } the destroydisplay() is something that given a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup. it should also call xtclosedisplay(). for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed. the return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp(). there are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate. some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources. the most likely symptoms are xlib errors such as badcolor, badatom, or badfont. there may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value. you may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display. there was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in november of 91. robert scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. what changed from r3 to r4 to r5? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- this addresses only changes in the intrinsics. first, the general changes for each release are described. then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed. brevity is a primary goal. much of the following information is retrieved from chapter 13 of the mit xt intrinsics manual and from o'reilly volume 5, 3rd edition. from r3 to r4 - addition of gadgets (windowless widgets) - new resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and additional data. - variable argument list interface. - #define xtspecificationrelease 4 (added with this release) - wmshellpart, toplevelshellpart & transientshellpart changed incompatibly. - core.initialize, core.set_values added arglist and count parameters - event handlers had continue_to_dispatch parameter added - core.set_values_almost specification changed. - core.compress_exposure changed to an enumerated data type from boolean - core.class_inited changed to enumerated data type from boolean - constraint.get_values_hook added to extension record - core.initialize_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.initialize - shell.root_geometry_manager added to extension record - core.set_values_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.set_values - calling xtquerygeometry() must store complete geometry. - added unrealizecallback. - xttranslatecoords() actually works under r4. from r4 to r5: - psuedo resource basetranslation added. - searching for app-default, and other files, made more flexible - customization resource added. - per-screen resource database. - support permanently allocated strings. - permanetly allocated strings required for several class fields. - the args argument to xtappinitialize, xtvaappinitialize, xtopendisplay, xtdisplayinitialize, and xtinitialize were changed from cardinal* to int* - many performance improvements (this is summarized from the article "xt performance improvements in release 5" by gabe beged-dov in "the x resource", issue 3): 	- xrmstringtoquark() augmented with xrmpermstringtoquark() to 	 avoid string copies. several fields in the class record are 	 indicated as needing permanent strings. 	- using an array of strings for resources 	- callback lists redesigned to use less memory 	- translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes 	 less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of 	 action bindings 	- keycode to keysyms are cached. 	- better sharing of gc's with modifiable fields 	- window to widget translation uses less space and faster 	- does not malloc space for widget name since quark is available 	- widget space is allocated to include the constraints 	- over several example programs, about

20. where are the resources loaded from? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- the resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority): 	1. args passed at creation time. 	2. command line arguments. 	3. user's per host defaults file 	4. user's defaults file. 	5. user's per application default file. 	6. system wide per application default file. note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup. the result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries. the per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer. this file is either specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not set then the file $home/.xdefaults-<host> is used. the user defaults file is either obtained from the resource_manager property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $home/.xdefaults is used. typically, the program "xrdb" is used to set the resource_manager property. please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property. a size of around 1-3kbyte is reasonable. some toolkits may track changes to the resource_manager but most do not. a user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application. the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found. read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. the system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults. if such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used. the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found. read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. [thanks to oliver jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92] you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xt-based programs -- xfilesearchpath, xuserfilesearchpath, and xapplresdir. these environment variables control where xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing. xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath. set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. suppose, for example, that you are running sun's open windows, and you also have some r4 x applications installed in /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults. you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath, and it would cause xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/x11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your openwinhome is located): 	setenv xfilesearchpath /usr/lib/x11/%t/%n:$openwinhome/lib/%t/%n the value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames. the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see xtresolvepathname()): 	%n	the value of the filename parameter, or the 		application's class name. 	%t	the value of the file "type". in this case, the 		literal string "app-defaults" 	%c	customization resource (r5 only) 	%s	suffix. none for app-defaults. 	%l	language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_jp.euc") 	%l	language part of %l (e.g. "ja") 	%t	the territory part of the display's language string 	%c	the codeset part of the display's language string let's take apart the example. suppose the application's class name is "myterm". also, suppose open windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) 	/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n means /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults/myterm 	$openwinhome/lib/%t/%n means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/myterm as the application initializes, xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown. as soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others. the effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/x11, then in /usr/openwin. let's consider another example. this time, let's set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. 	setenv xuserfilesearchpath ./%n.ad:$home/app-defaults/%n the first path in the list expands to ./myterm.ad. the second expands to $home/app-defaults/myterm. this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app-defaults file myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. note: when looking for app-default files with xuserfilesearchpath, for some bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %t and %s are useless. with r5, there's another twist. you may specify a customization resource value. for example, you might run the "myterm" application like this: 	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color" if one of your pathname specifications had the value "/usr/lib/x11/app-defaults/%n%c" then the expanded pathname would be "/usr/lib/x11/app-defaults/myterm-color" because the %c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. the default xfilesearchpath, compiled into xt, is: 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\ 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\ 		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n (note: some sites replace /usr/lib/x11 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings.) the default xuserfilesearchpath, also compiled into xt, is 		<root>/%l/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%l/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%l/%n:\ 		<root>/%l/%n:\ 		<root>/%n: <root> is either the value of xapplresdir or the user's home directory if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default, xt ignores xapplresdir altogether. notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to ".", a single dot. in r3, all this machinery worked differently; for r3 compatibilty, many people set their xapplresdir value to "./", a dot followed by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. what order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (courtesy of donna converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92) the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order. this is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list. neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution. the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list. even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback says: 	"callback_name: specifies the callback list to which the 	procedure is to be appended." you may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. how do i know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (courtesy of donna converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92) > i am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. i set the visible > interest field in core and if my window is completely obscured, the core > visible flag goes false. however, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to true. right, everything is implemented correctly. this demonstrates a "deficiency" in the x protocol, and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol. (the "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.) the xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully. the visible field will not change in response to iconification. a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs. this is the protocol deficiency. visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol; see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual. > is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something > else which needs to be done? you'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager. > if the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified? as an application writer, keep track with a global boolean in an action routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget which contains your custom widget. as the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes. these are suggestions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. how do i reparent a widget in xt, i.e. xtreparentwidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- you can't. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. why use xtmalloc, xtfree, etc? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning null. at best it is handled something like: 	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) 	if (!ptr) 	{ 		perror ("malloc in xyzzy()"); 		exit (1) 	} to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions xtmalloc(), xtcalloc(), xtnew(), xtnewstring() and xtrealloc() which all use the standard c language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute xterrormsg() if a null value is returned. xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits. in addition, if xtrealloc() is called with a null pointer, it uses xtmalloc() to get the initial space. this allows code like: 	if (!ptr) 		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); 	else 		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); 	++count; to be written as: 	ptr = xtrealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count); also, xtfree() accepts a null pointer as an argument. generally, i've found the xt functions conveniant to use. however, anytime i'm allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so i can fully recover from not enough memory errors. xtnew() and xtnewstring() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string: 	 struct abc *xyzzy; 	 char	 *ptr; 	 char	 *str = "abcdef"; 	 xyzzy = xtnew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ 	 ptr = xtnewstring (str); a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free(). i.e. code such as: 	 char	 *ptr; 	 ptr = xtmalloc (100); 	 /* ... */ 	 free (ptr); may not work. personally, i'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor. a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree() on a string when they should really be using xmstringfree(). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. how to debug an xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- first, i'd recomend getting "purify" from pure software. this is a great package for tracing memory problems on sun's. it's a bit pricey at $2750 but i'd still recomend it. excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info). 	purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into 	the object code produced by existing compilers. these 	instructions check every memory read and write performed by 	the program under test and detect several types of access 	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past 	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory. purify inserts 	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including 	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies 	system call interfaces. in addition, purify tracks memory 	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel 	adaption of garbage collection techniques. purify's nearly 	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program 	down typically by a factor of two to five. an alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a sun), runs on many unix's and has pretty similar features is "the sentinel debugging environment". this replaces malloc() and several other c library functions to add additional checks. (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info) next, if you are getting any sort of xlib error, you'll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line argument or by setting the variable xdebug to 1 with your debugger. then set a break point in exit(). this will let you trace back to the original xlib function being called. if you don't run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous. next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource "xtidentifywindows" or the class resource "xtdebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. for example: example% xload -xrm '*xtdebug:true' & example% xwininfo -tree 	 <click in new xload window> will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included. this can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets. next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libxtgeo.tar.z. this acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both. it's a very clever idea. the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu). the server effectively locks up and you'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually. the server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped. the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this: 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% setenv display othermachine:0; 	thismachine% gdb application	# your favorite debugger. 	or this: 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% gdb application 	(gdb) set environment display othermachine:0 	(gdb) run ... i believe codecenter, a c interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints. debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work. you can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works. judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. why don't xtaddinput(), xtaddtimeout() and xtaddworkproc() work? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput, xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc. the problem i have is that when i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly. i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. the introduction in r3 of the xtapp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see q19 for other changes in r3, r4, and r5). what happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created. since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you won't get those events. for example: 	... 	cnt = 0; 	toplevel = xtappinitialize(&app, class, 				 desc, xtnumber (desc), 				 &argc, argv, 				 fallback, args, cnt); 	xtaddtimeout (...) 	xtaddworkproc (...) 	xtappmainloop (app) would never invoke the timeout. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. what is and how can i implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (courtesy of roger reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 feb 93) drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive'' fashion. motif version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, openlook has supported d-n-d all along. the two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as i know, they are not published. i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients. my intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on xt). the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm conventions, for more details read the code. i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than motif 1.2 stuff. also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif anyway. the latest rdd (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr. a (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib. -- pete ware					ware@cis.ohio-state.edu cis dept, ohio state university			w/ (614) 292-7318 228 bolz hall, 2036 neil ave.			h/ (614) 538-0965 columbus, oh 43210

hi, i'm trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine, and i'm observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a drawingarea. namely, some xlib operations work, and some do not. in particular, the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some xdrawpoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on some part of the drawing area. this also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction. assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server bug? thanks, zack t. smith

i'm writing 'xwall', a simple x version of 'wall', and i want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays. the problem is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm (login screen). i've been through the manuals and faq and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable' ahead of time, or to get xopendisplay to fail after a short period of time. any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info? thanks... -- andy moore (andy@ice.stx.com) _______________________________________________________________________________ "you could say i've lost faith in the politicians/ they all seem like game show hosts to me..." - sting
i'm considering writing my own widgets, but i like to have some sample widget source code to look over first. where could i find something like this? are there any archives accessible by anonymous ftp that contain such information? 							thanks, 							edward
i have looked through the faq sections and have not seen a answer for this. i have an x/motif application that i have written. i have a couple of gif files (or pict) that i have scanned in with a color scanner. now i would like to be able to convert the gif files into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of its main window. preferably with pixmaps, or perhaps as an ximage. i have found functions in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, and i really do need color. i have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes out several formats, but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in as a pixmap. is there an easy way to do this? email responses preferred. thanks!

these guidelines. x x changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars. --->		 | x x xwhat is new in 1993: x x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c x has been updated. see entry format. x x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with x non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, c preprocessor x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes. x x xhints and suggestions: x x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners. x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year x might be 'old' the next year. x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry: x x	* look at the original source x	* convert ansi tri-graphs to ascii x	* c pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines x	* c pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines x	* run it through a c beautifier x	* examine the algorithm x	* lint it x	* compile it x	* execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x 'cleaned up' by the c pre-processor and a c beautifier. x x your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests. in certain x cases, a test is not important. entries that compete for the x 'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand, given x two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it. x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such, we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life x programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important. for this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. x x if you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the x 3217 byte size limit. also, abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse. x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules' x and then plug the hole next year. even so, we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed, if not smaller. :-) x x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly x in or near the final round. on the other hand, we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that x 16 is a prime number. if you do have a bug, you are better off x documenting it. noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power x of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry. and sometimes, x a strange bug/feature can even help the entry! of course, a correctly x working entry is best. x x xour likes and dislikes: x x doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we x tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests x that we apply. simply abusing #defines or -dfoo=bar won't go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: x x	#define d define x	#d foo		 <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo x x	int i; x	j;		 <-- don't use such implicit type declaration x	int k; x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you x must use non-ansi c, such as k&r c, you must avoid areas that result in x compile/link errors for ansi c compilers. x x unfortunately, some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of | x integral type. thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should | x not be used in 1993. this rule may be relaxed in future contests.	 | x x	int i; x	char *c; x	i[c];		 <--- use c[i] instead x	(i+3)["string"]; <--- use "string"[i+3] instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments, be careful. systems implement va_list as a wide variety x of ways. because of this, a number of operations using va_list are x not portable and must not be used: x x	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable x	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable x	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg x	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg x	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables x	* using va_list as a structure or union x x in particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. x x avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. x x if you use c preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), x the leading '#' must be the first character on a line. while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. x x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries x must not assume that it returns an int. x x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for x programs that are compact, and are instructional. x x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. x x we tend to dislike programs that: x x	* are very hardware specific x	* are very os or un*x version specific x	 (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific x	 code is likely not to be) x	* dump core or have compiler warnings x	 (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) x	* won't compile under both bsd or sys v un*x x	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit x	* obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs x	* are longer than they need to be x	* are similar to previous winners x	* are identical to previous losers :-) x x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out, x but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -d's in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint. x x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. x x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) x know of a smaller one! x x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend x on color or a given size. don't require backing store. x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a). x don't use m*tif, xv*ew, or openl*ok toolkits, since not everyone x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better x yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems. x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines x in the ---remark--- section. x x we like programs that: x x	* are as concise and small as they need to be x	* do something at least quasi-interesting x	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) x	* are portable x	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x	* make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x	* make us laugh and/or throw up :-) x x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several x areas really does help. x x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well. x x be creative! x x xentry format: x x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format, x in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself. (see judging process) x x we have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry.c: x x	this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases, x	where this program differs from the contest rules, the x	contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the x	contest rules before submitting an entry. x x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient, however, x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules. x x if you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about x the mkentry.c program, please send email to the judges. (see below) x x the following is a sample entry: x x---entry--- xrule:	1993 xfix:	n xtitle:	chonglab xentry:	0 xdate:	mon mar 1 08:45:20 1993 xhost:	un*x v6, pdp11/45 x	2.9bsd, pdp11/70 x---remark--- x this is a non-obfuscated obfuscated c program. x x it is likely not to win a prize. but what do you expect from x a short example!

(our decoding tools aren't x ai progs!) if you need tell the the something, put it in the x ---remark--- section, or send a email to the judges at: x x	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for x	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) x x the date should be given with respect to utc. (some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt0) the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime() in the c locale. an example of such a string is: x x	thr apr 01 00:47:00 1993 x x this format is similar to the output of the date(1) command. the x string does not include the timezone name before the year. on many x systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: x x	date -u "+%a %h %d %t 19%y" x	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' x	sh -c 'tz=utc date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x	sh -c 'tz=gmt date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x	sh -c 'tz=gmt0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' x x you are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry. to do so, set x the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced. x x xjudging process: x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll. x x entries are unpacked into individual directories. the email message x is unpacked into individual files, each containing: x x	---entry--- section x	all ---author--- sections x	all ---info--- sections x	---build--- section x	---program--- section x	any other text, including the email message headers x x prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly). information from the x ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is x complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. x x the above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular x individual. we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given. we like the surprise of finding x out in the end, who won and where they were from. x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. x because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all x attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. we remove all non-winning x files, and shred all related paper. by tradition, we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received. (for the curious, x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks) x x after the usenix announcement, we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries. one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry. they are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos. we x often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. during a round, x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; x the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does x not. we also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round. thus, an entry gets at least two readings. x x a reading consists of a number of actions: x x	* reading the ---entry--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section x	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any x	* passing the source thru the c pre-processor x	 shipping over any #include files x	* performing a number of c beautify/cleanup edits on the source x	* passing the beautified source thru the c pre-processor x	 shipping over any #include files x x in later rounds, other actions are performed: x x	* linting the source x	* compiling/building the source x	* running the program x	* performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it x does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form x award categories. entries begin to compete with each other for awards. x an entry often will compete in several categories. x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive. a typical category list might be: x x	* best small one line program x	* best small program x	* strangest/most creative source layout x	* most useful obfuscated program x	* best game that is obfuscated x	* most creatively obfuscated program x	* most deceptive c code x	* best x client (see our likes and dislikes) x	* best abuse of ansi c x	* worst abuse of the rules x	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> x x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example, a few entries are so x good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. x we will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. x x in the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round, is x less clear cut. x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out x by a similar, but slightly better entry. for this reason, it is x sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes, of course, x that the entry is worth improving in the first place! x x more often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a x strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way. x x in the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often, the x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. x x xannouncement of winners: x x the first announcement, occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition, x this is done during the latter part of the uunet/ioccc bof, just prior to x the berkeley bsd, and bsdi bof. x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups: x x	 comp.lang.c		 comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources x x in addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x	 comp.sources.d	 alt.sources.d		misc.misc x	 comp.sources.misc	 comp.windows.x x x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see x below for details. x x often, winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners x have appeared in books ("the new hackers dictionary") and on t-shirts. x x last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!

i have a program produces a continuous tone by calling xbell repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. if it is run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the x server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program have exited. is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by emptying the x server bell buffer when each program exits? - disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the jet project.

[courtesy mit x consortium] 	note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -bstatic to most c compilers). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 102) can olit programs run with r5 xt? (_xtqstring undefined) this is a bug in the olit. _xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in x11r4 (upon which ow 3.0's libxt is based). it wasn't documented and was removed in x11r5 (mit's guarantee of upward compatibility between the r4 and r5 libraries only applied to the documented interface). a workaround is to temporarily set your ld_library_path to point to the x11r4 or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against.

[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (bob scheifler), 12/90] the r5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs-mounted disks. xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 104) how do i get around the frame-buffer security hole? 	on many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second x session on your console display. check the man page for fbtab(5).

[7/91: document version is now 1.06] these imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. 	- see "system administration - imake: friend of foe?" by dinah mcnutt in the november 1991 issue of sunexpert. 	- german readers should expect in june 1992 an article "das meta-make / i make, you make / schwerelos" by rainer klute in "ix multiuser-multitasking-magazin", directed at application programmers needing to write imakefiles. an english-language derivative of this article is in the x journal, issue 2:1. 	- the o'reilly x resource issue #2 contains paul davey's article on demystifying imake. 	- alain brossard's working document full of tips on imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.z. [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 107) where can i get imake? 	versions are distributed with the r4 and r5 releases. an earlier version is distributed with the x11r3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. there are no real standards for such configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with x11r5. 	export contains the r5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. 	a stand-alone version of imake, but one stemming from x11r5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/x11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.z (192.76.144.75). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 108) i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile. what to do? 	if you have r4 or r5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". this is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. the output is a makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile. then run make, which will use that new makefile to compile the program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 109) why can't i link to the xlib shape routines? when i try to compile certain programs, i get the following link error: 	undefined: 	_xshapequeryextension 	_xshapecombinemask 	these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x (shape) which was introduced in the mit x11r4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows. like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it. pre-x11r4 servers, as well as many vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway. 	in order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library libxext.a. in the x11r4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory. if you do not have these files, do not despair: many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -dshape define from the makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied x libraries. [from john b. melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 110) what are these problems with "_xtinherit not found" on the sun? when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine i get the error "ld.so: symbol not found _xtinherit". 	what you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the r4 libxt.a to get sun shared libraries working. apparently, you can't share a function that is both called and compared, as _xtinherit is. this was handled by putting _xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in initialize.c, where xttoolkitinitialize() and xtinitialize() reside. these routines would normally be called. 	you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xt-based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize() anywhere. 	1) it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a connection to the x server. [osf/motif's 1.1.0 uil had this problem; it called xtmalloc() and other xt functions.] the solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. 	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize() -- it may be an xlib or xview program. in this case, you can remove -lxt from your link command. 	it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem. 	 [from jordan hayes (now jordan@moorenet.com) and danny backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 111) why can't i compile my r3 xaw contrib programs under the new x? i have a program that worked well under x11r3. when i try to link it under the current version of x, i get this message: 	undefined: 	_xtscrollbarsetthumb 	_xttextsetinsertionpoint 	_xttextreplace 	there were several name changes in the athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <x11/xaw/>); these are mentioned in the r4 release notes. in this case, these functions are not really xt functions but are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt* to xaw*. [10/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 112) topic: programming problems and puzzles ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 113) why doesn't my program get the keystrokes i select for (sic)? 	the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another. in order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus. to do this, you must set up what are called "hints" for the window manager. if your applications is xlib-based, you can use something like the following: xwmhints wmhints; ... wmhints.flags = inputhint; wmhints.input = true; xsetwmhints(dpy, window, &wmhints) if your application is based on the xt intrinsics, you can set the xtninput resource to be true (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:true'. certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having this done. 	if you are using sun's openwindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't icccm-compliant. 	openwindows.focuslenience: true [mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 114) how do i figure out what window manager is running? 	you can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case. 	for most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so long as you do things in an icccm-conformant manner. there are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. alternatively, it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 115) is there a skeleton x program available? 	 	there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. in x, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing x applications. good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple r4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the r3 and r4 distributions, and the xlib "hello world" example in the r3 doc/helloworld and r4 doc/tutorials/helloworld; an updated version of this program which uses r4 xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x by glenn widener of tektronix. 	[3/90] 	in addition, a sample xt program (for xaw or xm) by rainer klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.z. [4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 116) why does xtgetvalues not work for me (sic)? 	the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. your code may be doing something like this: 	{ 	arg args[3]; 	int i; 	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ 	i=0; 	xtsetarg (args[i], xtnsensitive, &sensitive); i++; 	xtgetvalues(widget, args, i ); 	... 	} but xtnsensitive is a boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable "sensitive" as boolean works properly. this problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types dimension and position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. in general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 117) why don't xtconfigurewidget/xtresizewidget/xtmovewidget work? 	you're probably trying to use these functions from application code. they should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. other promising functions, xtmakegeometryrequest() and xtmakeresizerequest(), are also for use only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. 	the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources. although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted. 	[the xlib calls xmovewindow() and xresizewindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change xtnx, xtny, xtnwidth, or xtnheight.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 118) why isn't there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow? 	although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the "new" widget should be. resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? what should happen to the widget's children? and by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget. 	note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- david b. lewis 					faq%craft@uunet.uu.net 		"just the faqs, ma'am." -- joe friday -- david b. lewis		temporarily at but not speaking for visual, inc. day: dbl@visual.com	evening: david%craft@uunet.uu.net

[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 122) why doesn't xtdestroywidget() actually destroy the widget? 	xtdestroywidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 123) how do i query the user synchronously using xt? 	 	it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. the calls to askuser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. if it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: 	void quit(widget w, xtpointer client, xtpointer call) 	{ 		int answer; 		answer = askuser(w, "really quit?"); 		if (ret_yes == answer) 			{ 			answer = askuser(w, "are you really positive?"); 			if (ret_yes == answer) 				exit(0); } 	} 	a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. 	this is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. that function askuser() looks something like this, where the motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "ok", "cancel" and "help" or equivalents: int askuser(w, string) widget w; char *string; { int answer=ret_none;	/* some not-used marker */ widget dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/ arg args[3]; int n = 0; xtappcontext context; n=0; xtsetarg(args[n], xmnmessagestring, xmstringcreateltor(string, xmstring_default_charset)); n++; xtsetarg(args[n], xmndialogstyle, xmdialog_application_modal); n++; dialog = xmcreatequestiondialog(xtparent(w), string, args, n); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnokcallback, response, &answer); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmncancelcallback, response, &answer); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnhelpcallback, response, &answer); xtmanagechild(dialog); context = xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (w); while (answer == ret_none || xtapppending(context)) { xtappprocessevent (context, xtimall); } xtdestroywidget(dialog); /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } 	the dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user. the variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w, client, call) widget w; xtpointer client; xtpointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; xmanycallbackstruct *reason = (xmanycallbackstruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case xmcr_ok: *answer = ret_yes;	/* some #define value */ break; case xmcr_cancel: *answer = ret_no; 		break; case xmcr_help: *answer = ret_help; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

[10/92; thanks to oliver jones (oj@pictel.com)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 127) how can my application tell if it is being run under x? 	a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. the easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x server: 	 	display = xopendisplay(display_name); 	if (display) 		{ do x stuff } 	else 		{ do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)null [in which case xopendisplay uses the value of $display, if set]. this is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $display set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 128) how do i make a "busy cursor" while my application is computing? is it necessary to call xdefinecursor() for every window in my application? 	the easiest thing to do is to create a single inputonly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (it needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for xlib-only applications; just use your top window): unsigned long valuemask; xsetwindowattributes attributes; /* ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = cwdontpropagate | cwcursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask = (keypressmask | keyreleasemask | buttonpressmask | buttonreleasemask | pointermotionmask); attributes.cursor = xcreatefontcursor(xtdisplay(toplevel), xc_watch); /* the window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */ xcreatewindow(xtdisplay(toplevel), xtwindow(toplevel), 0, 0, 65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, inputonly, copyfromparent, valuemask, &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. when you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. this will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. in addition, note also that most of the xaw widgets support an xtncursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

[thanks to pete ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and donna converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu), 5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 131) what are these "xlib sequence lost" errors? 	you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 132) how can my xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input? 	it's very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or the other file descriptor. 	a solution is use xtappaddinput(). after you open your file descriptor, use xtappaddinput() to register an input handler. the input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. write the input handler like you would any other xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns. it is important to use only non-blocking i/o system calls in your input handlers. 	most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. 	be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. you will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. xtappaddinput() is actually working as it is supposed to. the input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. a disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before. the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop(). there is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: 	 if (ioctl(fd, fionread, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; but, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using xtappaddinput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

(part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have "display" in the names -- xdisplaywidth, xdisplayheight, etc.) 	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 136) can i use c++ with x11? motif? xview? 	 	the x11r4/5 header files are compatible with c++. the motif 1.1 header files are usable as is inside extern "c" {...}. however, the definition of string in intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other string class and needs to be worked around. 	some other projects which can help: 	wwl, a set of c++ classes by jean-daniel fekete to wrap x toolkit widgets, available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/wwl-1.2.tar.z [7/92] or lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/wwl-1.2.tar.z. it works by building a set of c++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the widgets. 	the c++ interviews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu. interviews uses a box/glue model similar to that of tex for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user interfaces. some of its sample applications include a wysiwig document editor (doc), a macdraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder (ibuild). 	things, a class library written at the rome air force base by the strategic air command, available as freeware on archive sites. 	motif++ is a public-domain library that defines c++ class wrappers for motif 1.1; it adds an "application" class for, e.g., initializing x, and also integrates wcl and the xbae widget set. this work was developed by ronald van loon <rvloon@cv.ruu.nl> based on x++, a set of bindings done by the university of lowell graphics research laboratory. the current sources are available from decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) as /pub/x11/motif++.21.jul.92.tar.z. 	 	the source code examples for doug young's "object-oriented programming with c++ and osf/motif" [isbn 0-13-630252-1] do not include "widget wrappers" but do include a set of classes that encapsulates higher-level facilities commonly needed by motif- or other xt-based applications; check export in ~ftp/contrib/young.c++.tar.z. 	rogue wave offers "view.h++" for c++ programmers using motif; info: 1-800-487-3217 or +1 503 754 2311. 	a product called "commonview" by glockenspiel ltd, ireland (??) apparently is a c++-based toolkit for multiple window systems, including pm, windows, and x/motif. 	xv++ is sold by qualix (415-572-0200; fax -1300); it implements an interface from the gil files that sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 produces to xview wrapper classes in c++. 	uit is a set of c++ classes embedding the xview toolkit; it is intended for use with sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 builder tool. sources are on export.mit.edu.au as uit.tar.z. version 2 was released 5/28/92. 	 	also of likely use is objectcenter (saber-c++). and a reasonable alternative to all of the above is parcplace's (formerly solbourne's) object interface.

[3/90] 	scheme bindings to xlib, osf/motif, and xaw are part of the elk distribution; version 1.5a on export obsoletes the version on the r5 contrib tape. 	x-scm, a bolt-on accessory for aubrey jaffer's "scm" scheme interpreter that provides an interface to xlib, motif, and openlook, is now available via ftp from altdorf.ai.mit.edu:archive/scm/xscm1.05.tar.z and nexus.yorku.ca:pub/scheme/new/xscm1.05.tar.z. 	ada bindings to motif, explicitly, will eventually be made available by the jet propulsion laboratories, probably through the normal electronic means. advance information can be obtained from dsouleles@dsfvax.jpl.nasa.gov, who may respond as time permits. 	adamotif is a complete binding to x and motif for the ada language, for many common systems; it is based in part upon the saic/unisys bindings and also includes a uil to ada translator. info: systems engineering research corporation, 1-800-ada-serc (well!serc@apple.com). 	also: the mit consortium, although not involved in producing ada bindings for x, maintains a partial listing of people involved in x and ada; information is available from donna converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 138) can xgetwindowattributes get a window's background pixel/pixmap? 	no. once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients. the reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. the window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed. if you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use xcleararea() to clear a region to the background color and then use xgetimage() to read back that pixel. however, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun] 	note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. this is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants. by not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. [courtesy jim fulton, mit x consortium] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 139) how do i create a transparent window? 	 	a completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an inputonly window. in order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: 	- the shape extension first released with x11r4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension. 	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. note that there is no x notion of a "transparent color index". 	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. 	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly. [thanks to der mouse, mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu, 3/92; see also the x journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 140) why doesn't gxxor produce mathematically-correct color values? 	when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. however, the drawing operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices. the color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [on many x servers black and white often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] 	if you want to be combining colors with gxxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. 	if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and blue. [thanks to chris flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.edu) and ken whaley (whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 141) why does every color i allocate show up as black? 	make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8. the red, green, and blue fields of an xcolor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. if you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the xalloccolor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black. [thanks to paul asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 142) why can't my program get a standard colormap? i have an image-processing program which uses xgetrgbcolormap() to get the standard colormap, but it doesn't work. 	xgetrgbcolormap() when used with the property xa_rgb_default_map does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. [1/91; from der mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 143) why does the pixmap i copy to the screen show up as garbage? 	the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. this means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage. you probably want to clear the pixmap first using xfillrectangle() with a function of gxcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0l if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 144) how do i check whether a window id is valid? my program has the id of a window on a remote display. i want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. 	because x is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. what you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any badwindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. this scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its id reallocated to another window. [courtesy ken lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 145) can i have two applications draw to the same window? 	yes. the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the id can manipulate the resource [almost any x server resource, except for gcs and private color cells, can be shared]. 	the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple applications. a simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window id into it. the second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. 	[note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays.] 	note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. 	note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. if one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. [mostly courtesy phil karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 146) why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm? 	a number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. a general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use rootwindow(dpy,screen): /* function name: getvroot * description: gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root * arguments: the display and the screen * returns: the root window for the client */ #include <x11/xatom.h> window getvroot(dpy, scr) display *dpy; int scr; { window rootreturn, parentreturn, *children; unsigned int numchildren; window root = rootwindow(dpy, scr); atom __swm_vroot = none; int i; __swm_vroot = xinternatom(dpy, "__swm_vroot", false); xquerytree(dpy, root, &rootreturn, &parentreturn, &children, &numchildren); for (i = 0; i < numchildren; i++) { 	atom actual_type; 	int actual_format; 	long nitems, bytesafter; 	window *newroot = null; 	if (xgetwindowproperty(dpy, children[i], __swm_vroot, 0, 1, 	 false, xa_window, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems, &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newroot) == success && newroot) { 			root = *newroot; 			break; 		} 	} 	return root; } [courtesy david elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91] a header file by andreas stolcke of icsi on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for rootwindow and defaultrootwindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. 	 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 147) how do i keep a window from being resized by the user? 	resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. you can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 148) how do i keep a window in the foreground at all times? 	it's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking visibilitynotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. 	the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows). [thanks to der mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 149) how do i make text and bitmaps blink in x? 	there is no easy way. unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. [thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der mouse), 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 150)+ how do i get a double-click in xlib? 	users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. 	there is no good way to get only a double-click in xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks. you have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code. on most unixish implementations, you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of the x connection and then use select() or something similar on that. 	note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der mouse), 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 151)! how do i render rotated text? 	 	xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. 	your only choice, if you want to stay within the core x protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via xgetimage(), rotate it "by hand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via xputimage(); more specifically: 	1) create a bitmap b and write your text to it. 	2) create an xybitmap image i from b (via xgetimage). 	3) create an xybitmap image i2 big enough to handle the transformation. 	4) for each x,y in i2, i2(x,y) = i(a,b) where 		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) 		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 	5) render i2 	note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. 	the high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for x also permit rendering of rotated text: display postscript, pex, phigs, and gks, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. 	in addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

(how do i reserve names?) 	there are places in the x toolkit, in applications, and in the x protocol that define and use string names. the context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. 	the mit x consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. 	the list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/registry on the r5 tape; it is also available by sending "send docs registry" to the xstuff mail server. 	to register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

	when asking for help on the net or x mailing lists, be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing. the more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing. without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all. 	always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it from. if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system, give details of that, too. give the machine type, operating system, and o/s version for both the client and server machine. it may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using. 	then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen. if it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message. if a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 8) what publications discussing x are available? 	the trade magazines (unix world, unix review, computer language, etc.) are publishing more articles on x. two x-specific publications include: 	- o'reilly and associates publishes "the x resource: a practical journal of the x window system" (103 morris st. #a, sebastapol, ca 95472). editorial information: adrian nye, adrian@ora.com. 	- the x journal is started bi-monthly publication september 1991 on a variety of x topics. subscription information: the x journal, subscriber services, dept xxx, p.o. box 3000, denville, nj 07834, usa. editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 9) what are these common abbreviations/acronyms? 	xt: the x toolkit intrinsics is a library layered on xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. an "xt-based" program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets. 	xmu: the xmu library is a collection of miscellaneous utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets. 	xaw: the athena widget set is the mit-implemented sample widget set distributed with x11 source. 	xm: the osf/motif widget set from the open software foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors. 	xhp (xw): the hewlett-packard widget set was originally based on r2++, but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to r3, as it is distributed on the x11r4 tapes. supplemental patches are available to use it with r4/r5. 	clx: the common lisp x interface is a common lisp equivalent to xlib. 	xdmcp: the x display manager protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an x terminal to request login service from a remote host. 	xlfd: the x logical font description conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources. 	rtfm: common expert-speak meaning "please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- read the forgotten manual". 	utsl: a common expression meaning "take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- use the source, luke". 	api: application-programmer interface. the function calls, etc., in a programming library. 	bdf: bitmap distribution format; a human-readable format for uncompiled x fonts. 	gui: graphical user interface. 	uil: the user interface language, part of osf/motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple "outline" form 	wcl: the widget creation language, a package which extends the understanding of the xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file 	gil: the file format put out by sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 	uims: user interface management system ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 10) what is the icccm? (how do i write x-friendly applications?) 	the inter-client communication conventions manual is one of the official x consortium standards documents that define the x environment. it describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server. if you are writing x clients, you need to read and understand the icccm, in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager. get it either: 	- as part of the r4 distribution from mit 	- in the later editions of the scheifler/gettys "x window system" book 	- as an appendix in the new version of o'reilly's volume 0, "x protocol reference manual." a version in old copies of their volume 1 is obsolete. 	the version in the digital press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of digital press's editors to improve the english and the presentation. [from david rosenthal, 10/90] 	- the icccm was updated for r5; updates are published in o'reilly's "programmer's supplement for release 5". the complete document is on the r5 tapes. 	alternate definition: the icccm is generally the m in "rtfm" and is the most-important of the least-read x documents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 11) what is the x consortium, and how do i join? 	the mit x consortium was formed in january of 1988 to further the development of the x window system and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment. 	mit's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. membership in the consortium open to any organization. there are two categories of membership, member (for large organizations) and affiliate (for smaller organizations). 	most of the consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required. as designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations. typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers. once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard. the standards process typically includes public review (outside the consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. 	your involvement in the public review process or as a member or affiliate of the consortium is welcomed. 	write to: bob scheifler, mit x consortium, laboratory for computer science, 545 technology square, cambridge, ma 02139. [for complete information see the xconsortium man page from the x11r4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 12) just what are open look and motif? 	open look and motif are two graphical user interfaces (guis). open look was developed by sun with help from at&t and many industry reviewers; motif was developed by the open software foundation (osf) with input from many osf members. 	open look is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications. motif includes an api specification; the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the one from osf. however, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like osf/motif; one of these, parcplace's (formerly solbourne's) oi, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the style of open look and motif, at the user's choice. 	open look gui is also the name of a product from at&t, comprising their open look intrinsics toolkit and a variety of applications. [thanks to ian darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 13) just what is openwindows? 	open windows (3.0) is a sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a news and x11-compliant server (x/news); a user-interface specification (open look) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the sunview-like xview and the xt-based olit); xlib and xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.). [thanks to frank greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.com), 8/90; 4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 14) just what is decwindows? 	decwindows is a dec product that encompasses: an x11 server; the xui toolkit, including the dwt widget set and uil; xlib and xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.). (at some point motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 15) what is pex? 	pex is the "phigs extension to x". 	phigs stands for "programmer's hierarchical interactive graphics system" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3d graphics. many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3d objects; the extension allows the client (phigs in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3d graphics. 	sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current x copyright) sample implementation. source and documentation are available in the r5 release. several vendors are currently selling independently-developed pex servers for their workstations and x terminals. [last modified 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 16) what is "low-bandwidth x" (lbx)? xremote? ppp? slip? cslip? there are several options for using x over serial lines: slip - serial line ip; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over point-to-point serial links. it has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major tcp/ip implementations. most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow. the tcp/ip headers add 40 bytes per packet and the tcp/ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). cslip - compressed header slip; this is a variant of slip that compresses the 40 bytes of tcp/ip headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes. it still doesn't do anything about reencoding the x protocol. modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time). ppp - point-to-point protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip. a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for running normal tcp/ip protocols over serial lines. running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable. xremote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines. in addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp/cslip, xremote removes redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using lzw to compress the entire data stream. this work is done by either a pseudo-x server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server. there are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem: (1)	you don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't 	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly 	connected), and (2)	it reduces the i/o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that 	have to cross the serial interface, and (3)	in addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering 	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 	blocks to compress. lbx - low bandwidth x; this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area. it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using ncd's xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol. lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol. the hope is to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in r6. additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files: xremote-slides.ps slides describing xremote xremote-lbx-diffs.ps more slides describing some of lbx [information provided by jim fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92] 	there is also a set of slides on export from jim fulton's talk at the 7th mit x technical conference. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 17) topic: using x in day-to-day life ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 18)! what are all these different window managers? 	the window manager in x is just another client -- it is not part of the x window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. in approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the icccm): 	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in r2 or r3 	uwm: the universal window manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. moved to contrib/ on the r4 tape. 	twm (old): tom's window manager was among the first non-mit window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager. 	awm: the ardent window manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers 	cwm: cwm is part of the andrew system. 	rtl: siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. 	dxwm: digital's dxwm is part of the decwindows offering 	hpwm: hp's window manager offers a 3d look; it is a precursor of mwm 	mwm: the motif window manager is part of the osf/motif toolkit 	tekwm: tektronix's window manager offering 	olwm (sun): olwm implements the open look gui and some of the style guide functionality 	olwm (at&t): ditto 	gwm: bull's generic window manager emulates others with a built-in lisp interpreter. version 1.7h (10/91) is on the r5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] 	m_swm: the sigma window manager is on the r4 tape 	pswm: sun's postscript-based pswm is part of the openwindows release 	swm: solbourne's swm is based on the oi toolkit and offers multiple gui support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file 	twm (new): mit's new tab window manager from the r4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the r5 tape 	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the r4 twm and is available on archive servers. a new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on r5.9 and is available from export. [3/92] 	tvtwm: tom's virtual tab window manager is also based on the r4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. it is available on archive servers 	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to sun's olwm. it is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. 	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to osf's mwm. a beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to osf/motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. 	ncdwm: the window manager local to ncd terminals offers an mwm look 	xdswm: the window manager local to visual technology's terminals 	ctwm: claude lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the r5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of hp vuewm; source is on export. version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. 	vuewm: hp's mwm-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 	4dwm: sgi's enhanced mwm 	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 19) why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager (sic)? 	it needn't. what is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your x session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: 		exec xterm -name login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 20) can i save the state of my x session, like toolplaces does? 	although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and wm_command of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces. look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. there are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] 	some new pseudo session-managers such as hp's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database. [bjxrn stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 21) how do i use another window manager with dec's session manager? 	dec's session manager will start dxwm up by default. to override this, add to your .xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname: 	sm.windowmanagername: /wherever/usr/bin/x11/your_favorite_wm ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 22) how do i change the keyboard auto-repeat rate? 	you can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". the x protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. 	some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. if you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the xsun server from mit with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 23) how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string? 	there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. the xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do "macro expansion." 	some (few) clients, including xterm and several x-based editors, accept a translation resource such as: 	xterm*vt100.translations: #override \ 		<key>f1: string("setenv display unix:0") which permits the shorthand f1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. to include control characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. 	window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special "remapper" client been made available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- david b. lewis 					faq%craft@uunet.uu.net 		"just the faqs, ma'am." -- joe friday -- david b. lewis		temporarily at but not speaking for visual, inc. day: dbl@visual.com	evening: david%craft@uunet.uu.net
archive-name: x-faq/part2 last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 24)! how do i make a screendump or print my application? 	the xwd client in the x11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. it produces an xwd-format file of the image of that window. the file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. you can use this command: 		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. note that xwd also has an undocumented (before r5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [there are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.] 	two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. there are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent. 	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders xpm output [version unknown]. it is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.z. 	a screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.z. information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. 	xprint, by alberto accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.z. 	to post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the x11 distribution. also on several archives are xwd2ps and xtops, which produce encapsulated postscript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.z and contrib/imagemagick.tar.z). also useful is the pbmplus package on many archive servers; and the xim package contains level 2 color postscript output. 	the xv program can grab a portion of the x display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. imagemagick has similar capabilities. 	also: 	bristol technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers xprinter 2.0, an xlib api for postscript and pcl printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/bristol/xprinter. 	colorsoft 9619-459-8500) offers openprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for postscript and non-postscript printers. 	some vendors' implementations of x (e.g. decwindows and openwindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portion of screen" or "take a snapshot" options. some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' program which produces a sun raster file. some x terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer. 	some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. sony) include direct support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 25) how do i make a color postscript screendump of the x display?

[1/93] other good sources of information include the r4 version of that document and also the file in the r4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a compilation put together by skip montanaro (ge cr&d) listing the vt100 sequences. it dates from r3 but is fairly accurate. a hardcopy version was published in the december 1989 xnextevent (the xug newsletter). in a pinch, a vt100 manual will do.

(notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) 	/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n means /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults/myterm 	$openwinhome/lib/%t/%n means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/myterm 	as the application initializes, xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown. as soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others. the effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/x11, then in /usr/openwin. 	let's consider another example. this time, let's set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. 	setenv xuserfilesearchpath ./%n.ad:$home/app-defaults/%n 	the first path in the list expands to ./myterm.ad. the second expands to $home/app-defaults/myterm. this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app-defaults file myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. note: when looking for app-default files with xuserfilesearchpath, for some bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %t and %s are useless. 	with r5, there's another twist. you may specify a customization resource value. for example, you might run the "myterm" application like this: 	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color" 	if one of your pathname specifications had the value "/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c" then the expanded pathname would be "/usr/lib/x11/app-defaults/myterm-color" because the %c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. 	the default xfilesearchpath, compiled into xt, is: 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c:\ (r5) 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\ 		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\ 		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n 	(note: some sites replace /usr/lib/x11 with a projectroot in this batch of default settings.) 	the default xuserfilesearchpath, also compiled into xt, is 		<root>/%l/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%l/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%n%c:\ (r5) 		<root>/%l/%n:\ 		<root>/%l/%n:\ 		<root>/%n: 	<root> is either the value of xapplresdir or the user's home directory if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default, xt ignores xapplresdir altogether. 	notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to ".", a single dot. in r3, all this machinery worked differently; for r3 compatibilty, many people set their xapplresdir value to "./", a dot followed by a slash. [thanks to oliver jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 35) how to i have the r4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window? the answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, your /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 	displaymanager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 	displaymanager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/x11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: 	#!/bin/sh 	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xresources 	/usr/bin/x11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/x11/xdm/new.bitmap 	/usr/bin/x11/xrdb $* substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste. note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

[11/90] 	in addition, if all you need to do is start a remote x process on another host, and you find 		rsh <host> -n /usr/bin/x11/xterm -display $display too simple (display must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote x processes. the equivalent usage would be 		xrsh <host> xterm #! /bin/sh # start an x11 process on another host # date: 8 dec 88 06:29:34 gmt # from: chris torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu> # rsh $host -n "setenv display $display; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null" # # an improved version: # rxcmd (suggested by john robinson, jr@bbn.com) # (generalized for sh,ksh by keith boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu) # # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again. this # script combines the best of both. case $# in [01]) echo "usage: $0 host x-cmd [args...]";; *) 	case $shell in 	*csh*) host="$1"; shift 		xhost "$host" > /dev/null 		rsh "$host" -n \ 			"setenv term xterm; setenv display `hostname`:0; \ 			exec $* </dev/null >& /dev/null" & 		;; 	*sh) 		host="$1"; shift 		xhost "$host" > /dev/null 		rsh "$host" -n \ 			"term=xterm export term; \ 			display=`hostname`:0 export display; \ 			ld_library_path=/usr/x11/lib export ld_library_path; \ 			path=\$path:/usr/x11/bin:/usr/bin/x11:/usr/local/bin; \ 			export path; \ 			exec $* < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1" & 		;; 	esac 	;; esac ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 38) how can i design my own font? 	one way is to use the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g. sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the bdf format. see ollie jones's article in the november 91 x journal for more information. 	the r3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between bdf font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. 	an easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the r4 or r5 x11r5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.informatik.uni-dortmund.de [129.217.64.63], possibly as file /pub/windows/x/diverse-x11-sourcen/xfed.tar.z. it can produce bdf-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of x servers. 	the xfedor client from group bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, xpm1 pixmaps, and fonts. binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. 	if you are a metafont user you can use "mftobdf" from the seetex distribution to convert pk, gf, and pxl fonts to bdf format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. 	the gnu package fontutils-0.4.tar.z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. 	the o'reilly x resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. 	fonts can be resized with hiroto kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/x11/contrib. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 39) why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)? 	after you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for openwindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (you can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.) 	sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a badvalue error: 		x error of failed request:badvalue 			(integer parameter out of range for operation) 		major opcode of failed request: 51 (x_setfontpath) 	this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server. (the mention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.) -- is the font directory you're specifying readable from the server's file system? remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your font directory. trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm. -- is the directory really a font directory? if you're running an mit server (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file "fonts.dir". if you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1). (if you're running openwindows, look for the file "families.list". if you can't find it, run bldfamily(1).) -- if you're in a site where some people run x11rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (openwindows, for example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using. hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for open windows. if the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work for x11rn.

(what is xpm?) i want to be able to do something like this: 	xclock*backgroundpixmap: /usr/include/x11/bitmaps/rootweave 	you can't do this. the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). because of this, writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible, since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. therefore, neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource. the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy chris d. peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90] however: 	a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted 12/90 by sebastian wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap. 	the leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used by groupe bull in several of its programs, including the gwm window manager, by at&t in its olpixmap editor, and by ics in its interface builder. xpm distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.z, includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner. see information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. xpm 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on the r5 contrib tape.

[look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in r4.] [thanks to stephen gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 52) why do i get "warning: widget class version mismatch"? 	this error, which typically goes on to say, "widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003" indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -i include path and -l link-path to be sure. 	however, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the x11r4 xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. some sun ow systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 53) where can i find a dictionary server for xwebster? 	webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of webster's dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. after it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access. 	[the next machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. a webster daemon for next machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/next-2.0".] 	unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. 	however, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.z [10/91]; the file xwebster.readme includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and non-availability of dictionary servers.

(please respond via email!) has anybody actually seen the tek color space stuff working? i'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with o'reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net. the o'reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because xcmstekhvcquerymaxv returns a smaller value than xcmstekhvcqueryminv does (which makes no sense to me). the xtici editor fails in xcmsstorecolors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values. so you can't actually edit any colors. we have x11 r5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudocolor visual. i've poked around in the xcms code in xlib, but without some understanding of the theory i have no idea what's going wrong. can somebody confirm if either of the above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail for you too? please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have. any hints? please respond with email as i don't regularly read this group. thanks, karen ------------------------------------------------------------------------- karen bircsak concurrent computer corporation karenb@westford.ccur.com -------------------------------------------------------------------------
archive-name: x-faq/part3 last-modified: 1993/04/04 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 58)! where can i get patches to x11r5? 	the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup. 	patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which x11 is available. they are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of x11. 	people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. it now has 23 patches for x11r5 [3/93]. send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the subject line 		send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch. 	here are a few complications: 	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and "5d" separately 	2) the file sungx.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with solaris] 	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b" 	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c" 	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b" 	6) fix 18 replaces the r5fix-test1 for the x test suite, which previously was optional 	7) fix 19 also needs pexlib.tar.z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for "pexlib.uu.[1234]". 	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 59) what is the xstuff mail-archive? 	the xstuff server is a mail-response program. that means that you mail it a request, and it mails back the response. 	any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). the xstuff server treats the "subject:" header line just like any other line of the message. 	the archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories. each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an index. the top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it. 	1) the command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file. 	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. for example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). a message that requests an index cannot request data. 	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. to name an item, you give its directory and its name. for example send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 	you may issue multiple send requests. the xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. if the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest-first. 	4) some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses. if you use such a mailer, you won't get any response. if you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it. 	the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. if your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

can anybody tell me how to use the xmu function "xmucvtstringtowidget". i want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that i can connect two widgets together on an xmform. ie. myproggy*mylistsw.topwidget: maintextsw however, when i run the program, i get the message: warning: no type converter registered for 'string' to 'window' conversion.

can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications besides i.c.c.m.? i've looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it but nobody shows you how. o'reilly has no examples, iccm has no examples, asente & swick give no examples - in fact most of the books i've looked at, if they discuss icc at all, simply give a condensed version of the iccm and then refer you to the iccm. i did find one example of how to use atoms and properties in young's book and five hours after i bought young's book i had my applications talking to each other. i am not sure, however, if thats the best way. i'd like to stay independent of unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go. but within x one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups. i need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best for which purpose, and gives examples. without examples it's all just words. thanks in advance ross
well i am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway. i am running xterm and like all unix users, i run man <something>. recently, i switched to solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".i" directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. the resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very annoying to look at. back when i was using sunos 4.1.2, i remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining.... so my question is how do i change the xterm's behaviour under ".i" directives for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".b" directives are fine, i like them. and of course, i don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font, but not an italic font?? any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated. thanks -- john p.s. running xterm -rv won't work, i tried...

[ people seriously interested in the whole area of system performance, might want to look at the o'reilly nutshell handbook "system performance tuning" by mike loukides. i'm about 25% of the way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written comprehensive treatment of system performance. i'm unaware of any other similar books. --ed.] ----------------- table of contents ----------------- 0. introduction & administrivia 1. what about the "other x faq"? 2. window managers 3. the x server which server? locking the server into ram? starting your server fonts about the resources file ! define your display properly 4. clients a better clock for x a better terminal emulator for x tuning your client 5. miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures a quicker mouse programming thoughts say what!? 6. other sources of information 7. author & notes ! = changed since last issue. * = new since last issue. ----------------------------- introduction & administrivia ----------------------------- this document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers. if you are reading a copy of this faq which is more than a few months old (see the "last-modified" date above) you should probably locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated. if you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can retrieve this faq from an archive site. there exist several usenet faq archive sites. to find out more about them and how to access them, please see the "introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers. the main faq archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27]. this document can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups. if you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body. ----------------------------- what about the "other x faq"? ----------------------------- david b. lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written "comp.windows.x frequently asked questions" document. its focus is on general x information, while this faq concentrates on performance. the comp.windows.x faq does address the issue of speed, but only with regards to the x server. the gist of that topic seems to be: 	"use x11r5, it is faster than r4". (please see the x faq for complete details). --------------- window managers --------------- there are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different features and abilities. the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features. at this point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger, is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move". also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) i've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap. other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ the x server ------------ which server? - - - - - - - make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. if you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome x11 server. on my monochrome sun, i haven't noticed much difference between the xsun (colour) server and xsunmono, however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk), michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a sun system, x should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled sun compiler. you can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not using the bundled sunos compiler. i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. locking the server into ram? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged? eg: via a call to plock(). does this help performance at all? i've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it. i am not in a position to give it a try. 			 [thanks to: eric c claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com), 				 danny backx (db@sunbim.be), 				 juan d. martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] starting your server - - - - - - - - - - - joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) : if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep for a second or two after launching each one. after i changed my .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though. this sounds crazy, but i have confirmed that it works! warner losh (imp@solbourne.com) provided me with a good explanation of why this works, which i have summarized here: when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections. a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts. this process touches a large number of pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu, and more importantly, memory. if you put a sleep in there, you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so forth. all this activity is typically memory intensive. once this initialization is done ("the process has reached a steady state"), the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources this is most definitely a "your mileage may vary" situation, as there are so many variables to be considered: available ram, local swap space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients you are starting, etc. currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & i've experimented with: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) & i've even tried: 	(sleep 2; exec start_x_clients_script ) & and then in start_x_clients_script i had: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] all of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so i just stuck with my current setup, for its simplicity. you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. fonts - - - loading fonts takes time and ram. if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time. one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server. this will also conserve server resources, since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. 			 [ farrell mckay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au), 			 joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: my main xterm font is 7x13, so i also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc. twm's default font is 8x13. since i don't normally use 8x13, i've eliminated one font from my server. oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs. if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts, use a font server. about the resources file - - - - - - - - - - - - - keep your .xresources / .xdefaults file small. saves ram and saves on server startup time. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) one suggestion: in your .xdefaults (.xresources) file, try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications. for example: *reversevideo: true then, separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files. for example: $home/lib/app-defaults. in your .login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath: 	setenv xuserfilesearchpath $home/lib/app-defaults/%n [ the "comp.windows.x frequently asked questions" faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] so, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/xterm. xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/xdvi, and so on and so forth. note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource-file naming pattern. you can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/x11r5/lib/x11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files with the same name. this is all documented in the xt specification (pg 125 & 666). 		 [thanks to: kevin samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com), 		 michael urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov), 		 and mike long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). 	 kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - easier to maintain / more usable. - fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource_manager property. as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - applications only process their own resources, never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. it also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up. this doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference, and you might consider this a huge boon to usability. if you are modifying an application's resource database, you just need to re-run the application without having to "xrdb" again. - xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp. when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not. watch out for this!! i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file, which cpp stripped out. when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources. xt did *not* provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted processing the resource file. the loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef color'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - you may also run into some clients which break the rules. for example, neither emacs (18.58.3) nor xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored, your client will not find its resources. loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) a possible compromise suggestion that i have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for clients that i seldom use. define your display properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. in that situation, rather than setting your display environment variable to "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you should set your display variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0". by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. 			[thanks to patrick j horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] see the _display names_ section of the x(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. "i don't think it's stock mit, but (at least) data general and hp have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the display isn't set specially." 			 rob sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.uu.net) [jody goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an xlib patch to change stock r5 to use local communication even if display is not properly set. i don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-mit patches and so have elected not to include it here. hopefully mit will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves. in the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, email jody. --ed.] ------- clients ------- if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running. think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running. for example: is there a smaller clock program than xclock? unfortunately, i haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: xclock, xterm, xbiff) are welcome. --ed.] i've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject of x client programs. some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based, since xt, xaw and other toolkits are rather large. others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. in this case, using a non-xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of ram consumed. the upshot of all this seems to be: don't mix toolkits. that is, try and use just athena clients, or just xview clients (or just motif clients, etc). if you use more than one, then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. know your environment, and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment. 		 [thanks to: rob sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.uu.net), duncan sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ] a better clock for x - - - - - - - - - - - 1) xcuckoo suggested by: duncan sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk) available: on export.lcs.mit.edu xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program. saves screen real estate. 2) mclock suggested by: der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /x/mclock.shar non xt-based. extensively configurable. it can be made to look very much like mit oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing resources. of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall. :-) a better terminal emulator for x - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from the readme file distributed with xterm: +----- |		 abandon all hope, ye who enter here | | this is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution. | ... +----- ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used. i suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites. laziness? isn't there a better terminal emulator available? see below. if you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of savelines to reduce memory usage. [ oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com), 		 jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ] 1) xvt suggested by: richard hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) : available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.z "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog! " this was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. you don't have to rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be xterm. in it's current version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. i've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature, but i've not found any yet. update (march 1993): i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt. he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. for instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster. also, while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements (we don't have any hard numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. as an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets brought into memory. so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm. in summary? caveat emptor, your mileage may vary. if you can provide some hard data, i'd like to see it. specifically: how much ram each occupies, how much swap each needs, relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /x/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax. "i also have my own terminal emulator. its major lack is scrollback, but some people like it anyway." tuning your client - - - - - - - - - - suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster. from scott barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets: i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets, i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes, particularly the initial one in the field. examining the what was going on with xscope i found it. it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget (or even just a text widget) the i-beam cursor will blink. every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the widget code is making a request to the server (copyarea). the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0. it is not noticeable on a 40mhz sparc, but it does make a little difference on a [slower system]. this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas. consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests? ------------------------- miscellaneous suggestions ------------------------- pretty pictures - - - - - - - - don't use large bitmaps (gif's, etc) as root window backgrounds. - the more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc) - these take up ram, and cpu power. i work on a sun sparc and i'm conscious of performance issues, i can't comprehend it when i see people with a 4mb sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window. i'll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation. - if you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway. 		 [ thanks to qiang alex zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) 			for reminding me of this one. --ed.] a quicker mouse - - - - - - - - using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse. i use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file, which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist. see the xset man page for further ideas and information. hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work. to cover my options, i have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager. e.g. (for twm) : menu "mouse settings" { "mouse settings:"			f.title 	" very fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &" 	" normal (fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &" 	" system default (un-accelerated)"	! "xset m default &" 	" glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &" } programming thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) : to speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of things you can do. some that stick out: - for motif programs, don't set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget. again, stick to as few fonts as possible. - better yet, don't use motif at all. it's an absolute pig. - don't create and destroy widgets on the fly. try to reuse them. (this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.) - use a line width of 0 in gcs. on some servers this makes a huge difference. - compress and collapse multiple expose events. this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. francois staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : just a small remark: i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc, but i didn't find the time yet. i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ any confirmation on this from anyone? --ed.] andre' beck (andre_beck@irs.inf.tu-dresden.de) : - unnecessary noexpose events. most people use xcopyarea/xcopyplane as fastest blit routines, but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc used for the blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit, that, in most cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - thousands of xchangegc requests. this "gfx context switching" is also seen in most handcoded x-apps, where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again. xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). say what!? - - - - - - some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: david b. lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : how about this: swap displays with someone else. run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this, but i have received the following confirmation... michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se): i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this helps a lot on my poor little ss1+ with only 16 mb, it was essential when i only had 8 mb. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [the x11 server and the client are] competing for the same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine. not really a major problem, except that the x11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. timothy h panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu's are mostly idle, x's cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. if they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. the second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2 cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- other sources of information ---------------------------- volume 8 in o'reilly's x window system series, ``x window system administrator's guide'' is a book all x administrator's should read. adrian nye (adrian@ora.com): a lot more tips on performance are in the paper "improving x application performance" by chris d. peterson and sharon chang, in issue 3 of the x resource. an earlier version of this paper appeared in the xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. this paper is absolutely essential reading for x programmers. -------------- author & notes -------------- this list is currently maintained by art mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted. layout suggestions and comments (spelling mistak's too! :-) are also welcome. currently i have listed all contributors of the various comments and suggestions. if you do not want to be credited, please tell me. speedup-x-faq is copyright (c) 1993 by arthur e. mulder you may copy this document in whole or in part as long as you don't try to make money off it, or pretend that you wrote it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- ...art mulder ( art@cs.ualberta.ca ) | "do not be conformed to this world, department of computing science | but be transformed by the renewal university of alberta, edmonton, canada | of your mind, ..." romans 12:2
hello, when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying "cannot load app-defaults file..." check your xapplresdir environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory ( this is the app-defaults file for bx ) in the directory specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable. if you don't have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the builderxcessory file is. you can do this using the setenv command under csh. note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set xuserfilesearchpath to {bx}/%n.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly. to make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is set up. once you have taken care of this set the *systemdirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx. for example let's say i've installed bx in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this : *systemdirectory: /t/builderxcessory thanks, ics tech support

...let me point out that both gui-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and action-based, and the other symbol-based. true, but that's beside the point. this is a fact about an abstract model of what the gui users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (nb: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.) i'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. after all, that's what i do, too! i am saying that ui designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. i don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a "symbol manipulator". it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim. at any rate, i don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think like programmers. bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers --- these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation. but what they do is not programming, and programming is not required to do what they do. to restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions; no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

i am creating a graphics program using the athena widgets. i use xlib routines to install a custom graphics contex by obtaining the display, and window variables with the xtwindowofobject() and xtdisplayofobject(). the object was one of the sub widgets. the problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. i tried moving the allocation of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing changed. i am preforming all of this manipulation before calling xtappmainloop(). thank you for any help. leslie donaldson donaldlf@cs.rose-hulman.edu donaldlf@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu

hello motif world, a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif++. i got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and i know of several people who have been using motif++, and there are probably a number of people i am not aware of who are also using motif++. my question is: how many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. this would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to motif++. motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way i can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed. if you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to reply to this message, and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest, say about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and i will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. -- ronald van loon | in theory, there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl) | between theory and practice. 3dcv group, utrecht | the netherlands | in practice however, there is.
greetings, i am using an x server that provides 3 visuals: pseudocolor 8 bit, truecolor 24 bit and directcolor 24 bit. a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is tc24). in the xlib reference guide from 'o reilly one can read in the section about xcteatewindow, something like: "in the current implementation of x11: when using a visual other than the parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating, or else a badmatch occurs." this warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions of the x11r5 guides. however, even if i pass along a suitable colourmap, i still get a badmatch when i create a window with a non-default visual. the code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your crt ---------------- window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height) display *dpy; int width, height; { window win; xvisualinfo vinfo; xsetwindowattributes attr; fprintf(stderr,"opening 8 bit window...\n"); if (!xmatchvisualinfo(dpy,defaultscreen(dpy),8,pseudocolor,&vinfo)) { fprintf(stderr,"your display can't handle 8 bit pseudocolor.\n"); exit(1); } fprintf(stderr,"using visual: %x\n",vinfo.visual->visualid); cmap = xcreatecolormap( dpy, defaultrootwindow(dpy), vinfo.visual, allocnone ); xsync(dpy,false); xinstallcolormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */ attr.colormap = cmap; win = xcreatewindow( dpy, defaultrootwindow(dpy), 10,10, width,height, copyfromparent, /* border width */ 8, /* depth */ inputoutput, /* class */ vinfo.visual, /* visual */ cwcolormap, &attr ); return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your crt ----- executing this piece of code results in a badmatch error. anybody who knows why? if so, please drop me a line. 	take care, 		bram stolk 		stolk@fwi.uva.nl

hello everybody! i have a little question: due to more features (pex, drag&drop) many applications when linked with for example motif 1.2 instead motif 1.1 need more memory in the xserver. x-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). so my question: is there a possibility to determine via x protocol calls the size of free memory available to the xserver? so one can determine for example whether to start a pex application with the css on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory). please reply via e-mail, i'll summarize! sincerly, matthias -- matthias pfuetzner | @work: +49 6151 155-150 | @home: +49 6151 75717 6100 darmstadt, frg | zgdv, wilhelminenstrasse 7 | lichtenbergstrasse 73 pfuetzner@igd.fhg.de, pfuetzner@zgdvda.uucp | keith packard said: r5 is different from r4. that's why we changed the release number :-)

issue 5 of the x resource (the published proceedings of the 7th annual x technical conference) has an paper by mark linton and chuck price titled "building distributed interfaces with fresco". the summary describes fresco (formerly known as xc++) as an x consortium effort. without doing a complete review of the paper, i'll just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article. the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the xt toolkit or xlib. features they want in fresco include: lightweight objects, such as interviews glyphs structured graphics resolution independence natural c++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components multithreading this by no means captures the complete content of the paper. the conclusions sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in jan 93) for a complete sample implementation. i am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above. -- brian dealy |301-572-8267| it not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov | | that's important,it's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy | | where it's not at... b.dylan -- brian dealy |301-572-8267| it not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov | | that's important,it's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy | | where it's not at... b.dylan

"return_place" is probably incorrect. it should be a pointer, not an integer. xgetwindowproperty() allocates memory, copies the data there, and returns a pointer to the memory. you should free the memory when you're done. --- ken lee, klee@synoptics.com

i am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system. in keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor. i have a number of x level questions regarding this: (we are devloping on unix systems using x/motif. platform will be predominantly sun's, probably with ports to rs/6000 as well). i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens, and not multiple x displays. given this: 	- is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple 	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other? there's 	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between 	screens? 	- do i have to run separate window managers on the separate 	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? 	what are they; who sells them... 	- is a multi-screen window manager the only way i can grab a 	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next? 	- is there any way for the application to transparently see 	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware 	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0? 	- any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a 	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single 	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate 	multiple screens instead)? 	i am assuming that this is not a major issue - that i can rely 	on providing config files which will specify for each 	configuration the screen placement of each window in the 	application. any thoughts or suggestions from past experience 	are more than welcome. ======================================================================== jo pelkey phone: (509)375-6947 battelle pacific northwest labs fax: (509)375-3641 mail stop k7-22 email: je_pelkey@pnl.gov p.o. box 999 richland, wa 99352 ========================================================================
g'day windows nt is a step forward, but not by much. i guess for dos users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64k of memory, its a major improvement. for windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for granted. most of windows users only use pcs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. my ideal operating system: 	binary compatible across all plaforms. it should recognize 	binaries and configure on the fly, so i don't have to have 	bin/mac bin/dos bin/dec bin/sun bin/hp etc... 	multi-cpu. so i can use the cpus on my pc and w/s and mac 	and transputers and dsps. i don't know a single site which 	has gone for a single vendor. i am not going to trade-in 	80mflops per h1 transputer or ultra-fast fft on dsp chips. 	note nt runs on symmetric multi-cpu systems. 	built-in portable gui/graphics tools. you can call drawbutton 	or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform 	or display. it should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. 	so i can use pc graphics s/w on my workstation and x software on 	my pc. i think guis are not just nice to have but essential. 	configurable front-end. so you can make it look like unix or dos 	or nt or os/2, and run shell scripts or command/bat files. 	object oriented. so i can program easily under it and not have 	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch 	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly. in other words it should have some ai capability. that and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it. anyone know of something like this ? 	adios 	 ata <(|)>. -- | mail dr ata etemadi, blackett laboratory, | | space and atmospheric physics group, | | imperial college of science, technology, and medicine, | | internet/arpanet/earn/bitnet atae@spva.ph.ic.ac.uk or ata@c.mssl.ucl.ac.uk | | span spva::atae or msslc:atae |

"multi-headed" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a sun with a cg4 display). "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing "multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple screens. "zaphod" is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen. > is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ? there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at most 255 screens. i know of no server that handles multiple displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the r4 server can be looked upon as such; on a tcp-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to x. what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the mit one). if it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to x, the author of the article had no business writing about x. 					der mouse 				mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

hello, 	way back in the mists of time, i had a set of patches written by richard caley (i believe to the standars distribution, patch level 6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function. i still have the patches, however, i can no longer find the sources to which they applied ;-). 	i'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to where i could find the sources. has anyone updated the patches for r5?

i'd like to compile x11r5 on a sony nws-1750 running news 4.1c. the x distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine. but, also in the release notes, nothing from sony is listed under the supported servers. what am i supposed to use for my r5 x server then? how can the os be supported, but not the hardware? is there something in the r4 binaries that can be used as the r5 server? these may seem like silly questions, but i'm *really* confused. -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu "i will not raise taxes on the middle class." -unknown
here's what i (think) have figured out. all i need to do is install the r5 disitribution without the xserver like the sony.cf file defines, and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old server from r4 will still work. this will allow me to run xview 3.0, and have x11r5 up and running. does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs? another question: is it likely that since sun is dropping ow support that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public? it would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :) -- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu "i will not raise taxes on the middle class." -unknown

hi folks. as part of my self-introduction to x i've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows). changing your own applications icon is fairly simple: if you have a widget id you can just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap (or whatever) and you're done. alternately you can set window manager hints. these methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own. in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is: given a window-id, how do you change the icon pixure ? a working example would be very much appreciated. if it makes any difference, i'm using motif 1.1 on vms t6.0-5ke. thanks - scott :)
contents:problems with table widgets in r5 	the following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation 	system) did work in r4, but refused to in r5. of cause, the r4-version 	did not know about the xptablewidgetclass (we used tablewidgetclass 			instead - caught from the net in times of r3) and xptablechildposition 			(formerly xttblposition). 	since compiling with r5, the program causes a zero width or height error 	(on sparc-stations). the trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the 	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciitext 	widgets) exist, xtquerygeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 	thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. no wonder xtpopup 		or xtmanage- child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not). 	 	question: does anyone know, why xtquerygeometry returns so low prefered 			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what 			to do about? 	i'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. 	germans are requested to answer in german. 	 	siegfried kaiser 	email: kaiser@uniko.uni-koblenz.de 	 	the part of interest: 	/* graphischer neuaufbau des model-init-formulars */ 		/* storing the old width and height of the viewport-	*/ 		/* widget, which is the parent of the troubling table	*/ 		/* widget, before the viewport widget is destroyed	*/ 		/* the destroying of widgets before resizing them is a	*/ 		/* relict from r3-age					*/ 	 	if (model_init_popped_up) 		xtunmapwidget(model_init_form_view);

if you're willing to do a little work, you can make drawnbuttons do what you want, more-or-less. one of my colleagues here at ge crd has done just that in our internal lymb system. we have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence. using drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. you can make things look circular enough. -- skip (montanaro@crd.ge.com) "why can't x be this easy?" -- me, after learning about dlopen()

hi netters, i'm using sliders in my xview apps, usually with editable numeric field. but i seem to have no control over the length of this field. in some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by panel_max_value! as i understand, panel_value_display_length, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: 	/* panel_multiline_text_item, panel_numeric_text_item, 	 * panel_slider_item and panel_text_item attributes 	 */ 	panel_notify_level	= panel_attr(attr_enum,			 152), 	panel_value_display_length	= panel_attr(attr_int,		 182), which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. but 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: bad attribute, and return value 0. can someone share his experience in managing sliders in xview with me, and clear this problem? any help is very much appreciated. yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy

is there aything available for x similar to quickeys for the macintosh -- something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes, menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another application? if so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not, how hard do we think it might be to send input to other x applications and, hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately? (if an application is going to take a few seconds to process i probably have to wait for it to complete before sending another command.) thanks, david,
(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered) suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics. a button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles "regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image. using an expose event handler is a "proper" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped. the problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped. what we need to do is somehow "tickle" the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item. what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

i'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in motif/x. i'm running on an 8-bit display for which i've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors. i want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which i'm displaying a bitmap using xputimage(). if doesn't matter if the lines i draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed. currently, to draw interactively, i begin with: /* drawindex is an colortable index i reserve for the foreground */ /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */ palette_colors[drawindex].red = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red; palette_colors[drawindex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green; palette_colors[drawindex].blue = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue; xstorecolors( mydisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[drawindex], 1); xflush( mydisplay); xsetfunction( mydisplay, gc, gxxor); xsetforeground( mydisplay, gc, drawindex); then to draw i do: xdrawline( mydisplay, xtwindow( drawingarea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2); xflush( mydisplay); and when i'm all done, to return things to normal i do: xsetfunction( mydisplay, gc, gxcopy); what i'd like to happen is for the lines i draw to be the inverse of whatever i'm drawing over. instead what happens is i get white lines. if the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up. if the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up! it's very strange. but the gxxor function seems right - since if i do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image). any suggestions what i'm doing wrong? david

hi, has anybody implements an rpc server in the hp xwindows? in sun xview, there is a notify_enable_rpc_svc() call that automatically executes the rpc processes when it detects an incoming request. i wonder if there is a similar function in hp x/motif that perform the same function. any help is appreciated. nui chan nchan@ctr.columbia.edu
i am developing an x (xt,xm) application that will include a graphics window of some sort with moving symbols among other things. a pure x application could be implemented with motif widgets, one of which would be an xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib. but i would like to take advantage of the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs/6000 (sgi's gl i believe). is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program? can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me with xopenwindow? i have never used gl before, but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server. also, most of the gl calls do not require a display or gc, unlike most x calls. from this initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily. is this true? does pex (graphigs?) have the same functionality of gl? environment: aixwindows x11r4 motif 1.1 gl is available aix sys v 3.2 ibm rs/6000 360 thanks in advance. jay graham jade simulations international corp. 14 colonnade road, suite 150 nepean, ontario, canada 613-225-5900 x226 graham@ottawa.jade.com

hi, experts, i'm kind of new to x. the following question is strange to me. i am trying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without reason (to me). i am using the following piece of code: toplevel = xtinitialize(argv[0], "testcolor", null, 0, 			 &argc, argv); dpy = xtdisplay(toplevel); scr = defaultscreen(dpy); def_colormap = defaultcolormap(dpy,scr); if(xalloccolorcells(dpy, def_colormap, true, null, 0, cells, 5)) { color.pixel = cells[0]; color.red = 250; color.green = 125; color.blue = 0; color.flags = dored | dogreen | doblue; xstorecolor(dpy, def_colormap, &color); printf("\n try to allocate, the color %d as (%d,%d,%d)", 	 color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); xquerycolor(dpy, def_colormap, &color); printf("\n after allocate, the color %d is (%d,%d,%d)", 	 color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); } else printf("\n error: couldn't allocate color cells"); running output: try to allocate, the color 7 as (250,125,0) after allocate, the color 7 is (0,0,0) after xstorecolor(), xquerycolor() just returned the original value. no failure/error displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious unchanged. (i also tried to draw a line using the colors but it turned out to be the unmodified colors.) so what is my problem? how to modify the contents of the colormap? any help/information will be appreciated. please send mail to "yang@cs.umass.edu". -------------------------- william email: "yang@cs.umass.edu" -------------------------- by the way, the following is the environment i am using (output of "xdpyinfo"). it shows the default visual is pseudocolor. version number: 11.0 vendor string: decwindows digitalequipmentcorporation uws4.2 vendor release number: 1 maximum request size: 16384 longwords (65536 bytes) motion buffer size: 100 bitmap unit, bit order, padding: 32, lsbfirst, 32 image byte order: lsbfirst number of supported pixmap formats: 2 supported pixmap formats: depth 1, bits_per_pixel 1, scanline_pad 32 depth 8, bits_per_pixel 8, scanline_pad 32 keycode range: minimum 86, maximum 251 number of extensions: 8 adobe-dps-extension dpsextension shape mit-shm multi-buffering xinputextension mit-sundry-nonstandard dec-xtrap default screen number: 0 number of screens: 1 screen #0: dimensions: 1024x864 pixels (333x281 millimeters) resolution: 78x78 dots per inch depths (2): 1, 8 root window id: 0x29 depth of root window: 8 planes number of colormaps: minimum 1, maximum 1 default colormap: 0x27 default number of colormap cells: 256 preallocated pixels: black 1, white 0 options: backing-store yes, save-unders yes current input event mask: 0xd0001d keypressmask buttonpressmask buttonreleasemask enterwindowmask substructureredirectmask propertychangemask colormapchangemask number of visuals: 5 default visual id: 0x21 visual: visual id: 0x21 class: pseudocolor depth: 8 planes size of colormap: 256 entries red, green, blue masks: 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 significant bits in color specification: 8 bits visual: visual id: 0x22 class: grayscale depth: 8 planes size of colormap: 256 entries red, green, blue masks: 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 significant bits in color specification: 8 bits visual: visual id: 0x23 class: staticgray depth: 8 planes size of colormap: 256 entries red, green, blue masks: 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 significant bits in color specification: 8 bits visual: visual id: 0x24 class: staticcolor depth: 8 planes size of colormap: 256 entries red, green, blue masks: 0x7, 0x38, 0xc0 significant bits in color specification: 8 bits visual: visual id: 0x25 class: truecolor depth: 8 planes size of colormap: 8 entries red, green, blue masks: 0x7, 0x38, 0xc0 significant bits in color specification: 8 bits number of mono multibuffer types: 5 visual id, max buffers, depth: 0x21, 0, 8 visual id, max buffers, depth: 0x22, 0, 8 visual id, max buffers, depth: 0x23, 0, 8 visual id, max buffers, depth: 0x24, 0, 8 visual id, max buffers, depth: 0x25, 0, 8 number of stereo multibuffer types: 0

i found an oddity with our sgi indigo (mips r3000 chip). when xlock +nolock is running, and i am working remotely or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if xlock is not running. no other processes seem to affect my runtimes, yet this is very consistent! any explanations, real or imagined :) thanx dale@frostedflakes.llnl.gov
help: i am running some sample problems from o'reilly volume 4, xt intrisics programming manual, chapter 3. popup dialog boxes and so on. in example 3.5, page 76 : "creating a pop-up dialog box" the application creates window with a button "quit" and "press me". the button "press me" pops up a dialog box. the strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time. if i try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), it is *much* slower. has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why i get this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response time from 2nd time onwards ? anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time they popup in reasonable fast response time ? thankyou - shirley

i have a problem where an athena strip chart widget is not calling it's get value function. i am pretty sure this is happening because i am not using xtappmainloop, but am dealing with events via sockets.

we've developed a number of applications using devguide and found it to be a very useful tool. i've been impressed with the level of integration it affords using the connection editor. i love the general ease of use. i talked with tali aben at sun today about devguide + motif. she was very helpful. we provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next version of devguide. tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. i mentioned i was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional comments from the net on what devguide should evolve into. send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about devguide to: tali.aben@sun.com pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... more of this and computers may have a future. frankly, i like the idea that it will offer some migration capability to doe/domf through an integrated tooltalk capability, pointed out in march's sunexpert magazine. technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with devguide. price is outstanding.

[posted for a friend] okay, i looked through the faqs and didn't see this, but i know its come up before... xalloccolor is supposed to do the following in order: try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits) try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match. 	and when all else fails, return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors already allocated in the colormap. this sounds good in theory. it doesn't seem to work this way though. if there is no exact match already in the colormap, and no unallocated cells, then xalloccolor fails, even when it has already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens of read-only cells already in the colormap. is this a bug? a feature? a misunderstanding on my part? any help appreciated, noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

does xdm work with decnet? i have an ultrix machine running both tcp/ip and decnet. i have a number of x-terminals hanging off the ultrix host also running tcp/ip and decnet. presently i am using xdm for the login procedure on the x-terminals using tcp/ip. since xdm is basically just an x-windows client, shouldn't i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well? my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making tcp/ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no; you can not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not? any feedback is appreciated. thanks.

i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled under linux (sls release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems. actually, it seems that this is more of a gcc question, because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs/6000. 	basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, compositep.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : 	typedef void (*xtwidgetproc) (widget) but in several places in the hp source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests. for example: 	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args) now, gcc chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function. so, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in gcc, or how i can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/x11/compositep.h, or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions. 	many thanks in advance for any help. -- <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> bill woodward | wpwood@austin.ibm.com <-- try this first aix software support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com graphics group | 512-838-2834 i am the terror that flaps in the night.

i've just managed to get xdm running from an ncr 3000 (an svr4 486 box running xfree86 1.2) to my ncd xdisplay. it's pretty much working, but i'm encountering a weird error. i'm attempting to start an xterm from my .xsession file, but nothing happens. redirecting stderr to a file using 'exec 2>$home/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message: "xterm: error 14, errno 1: not owner" now, if i start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line, it works fine. and starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm), and a clock, from my .xsession also works. anyone encountered this? suggestions? atdhvaannkcse -- des herriott, / as a wise man once said, micro focus, newbury. / +44 (0635) 565354 / "it takes a lot of brains to be smart, dnh@mfltd.co.uk / but it takes some neck to be a giraffe."

i am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. i have reprogrammed the f1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the following line in .xdefaults: ~ctrl ~shift ~alt <key> f1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\ i merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm which has the remapped f1 key. the problem that arises is that the application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e> sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each character being filtered or ignored. when i run xev and press the f1 key, i get the correct value showing up in the following two key events: keypress event, serial 14, synthetic no, window 0x2800001, root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104), state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen yes, xlookupstring gives 0 characters: "" keyrelease event, serial 16, synthetic no, window 0x2800001, root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104), state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen yes, xlookupstring gives 0 characters: "" notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe. but when i use the f1 key while in vi or in a program i wrote to spit back the hex values of keyboard input, i only get <7f> <3e>. does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what i can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to the final application? any help is greatly appreciated. please *email* any responses. jim kavitsky kavitsky@hsi.com
yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in /usr/lpp/gl somewhere... (it's named glib.c; my ibm's down right now though, so i can't find the exact location :) warning: this code feels quite bogus. it does things like calling noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an x window id from it anyway. it worked just fine under aix 3.1; i spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's turning into a hard job. check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and x, and how to go about doing so. )rob

(you could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&") you can also use "virtualdesktopbackgroundpixmap filename" or just virtualdesktopbackground if you just want another color besides grey. > ii) when i open an xterm on the sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised > and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters. did you install the sunkbd patch? it's in the contrib directory on export. all the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following: the end, pageup, pagedown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized. even the compose key works.

dear sgi and netter gl-x mixed-model experts, i am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows, and i've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests. in some environments (entry level r3000 indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an iris 4d 240/gtx; also a different entry level indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when i compile at different times. the most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap. my application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap. this is spectacularly aggravating. i would dearly appreciate 1. an explanation of the standard, right, correct way to give a window a colormap such that the window manager will honor and obey it; 2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my desired colormaps. by now i have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything reasonable or imaginable. below is example code giving the schematic for how i have been *trying* to do this. please, please, please somebody tell me what i am doing wrong/how to do it right!!! yours, chris lee /***********************************************************************/ display* dpy; /* declare some data... */ colormap popup_cmap; xcolor mycolor; window win; xsetwindowattributes cwa; int nwlist; window *wlist; /* nb: for brevity, not showing all code lines--just a schematic */ popup_cmap=xcreatecolormap(dpy,defaultrootwindow(dpy),vis->visual,allocall); /* here we store a bunch of colors using xstorecolor(dpy,popup_cmap,&mycolor); ... */ cwa.colormap = popup_cmap; win = xcreatewindow(dpy, parent, x, y, w, h, borderwidth, vis->depth, inputoutput, vis->visual, cwcolormap|cwborderpixel, &cwa); /* list all sub windows of my_topwin, parent of win, into wlist; nwlist is counter of entries in wlist. nb: wlist is static storage that can be relied on not to go away or be corrupted. i thought of that! does anyone know if setting wm properties is by data copy, or by reference pointer? ie. is it acceptable to pass data for a property, then free the data? */ xsetwmcolormapwindows(dpy,my_topwin,wlist,nwlist); xmapraised(display0,win); /* later on we handle xevents normally... typical eventloop */
hello netlanders: i am a novice x user with a question for any xgod. my computer configuration with the x problem is as follows: 486dx50/256/16ram running esix 4.0.4 wangtek at-style interface 250 m tape drive. i have loaded the basic os (which includes nsu) and inet utilities (tcp/ip). i ftp-ed the xfree86 (x11r5) binaries and installed properly. i can execute startx and run x-windows with no problems. however, if i try to access the tape drive while in x, the machine locks up instantly. if i am out of x and access the tape, the tape drive works fine. soon as i try to startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked. i have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. i've contacted esix about this problem. they claim their x-window x11r4 server (which i have) works with the wangtek tape drive. they also claim i only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run x; i don't need inet (tcp/ip). my experience has been that i need both to get xfree86 to work. i'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get x to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. i would like to get both x and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system. if you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated. one colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict. if this is true, what direction should i look to resolve the conflict ? thanks, kenneth cobler ksc@ihlpv.att.com at&t bell laboratories 263 shuman blvd. naperville, il 60566
according to the osf/motif style guide, one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. so a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a "caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. when cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a drawingarea, things get even more complicated. my intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. the topics on "busy cursors" in the several faq's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'none'. ----------------------------------------------------------------- hans geurtsen phone: (31) (0) 8385 - 33157 nucletron research bv. e-mail: hgn@nuclint.nl surface: waardgelder 1 nl-3905 th veenendaal
i am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a remote display. a local display being connected to the same system that the client is executing on. i have access to the display string but can i tell from the string? if the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0", and "localhost:0" are all local. under ultrix, i believe that "local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection maybe?). are there other strings that i should check for? is there a better way to detect this? thank you for any help you can give me. -- ======================================================================== jim atkinson		wavefront technologies, inc. jra@wti.com		what, me? a company spokesperson? get real! =================== life is not a spectator sport! =====================
some time back i asked for software recommendations to allow me to run x from my pc at home to my sparc at the office. many thanks for all replies, the majority of people recommended pcxremote from ncd. i received it yesterday and installed it on my sparc and pc with only one hitch. the unix install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. on the pc side, i ordered the windows version which came with a slick windows installation. the only problem i had was that my .xinitrc in my home directory had the line display=`hostname`:0.0; export display s.t the clients i kicked off connected to my xserver on the sparc console. by removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at `hostname`:1.0 some comments on performance, i was connected to a sparc 2 thru a netblazer terminal server over a 9600 baud line. my pc is a 486-dx2 ati ultra, 16 mb bitmap stuff sucked. basic editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. xmail was very usable. at times the first time u typed in an xclient window there was a very noticable delay, i put this down to brain damaged "windows should not be called a scheduler", besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while. has anybody tried the non windows version of the product, the sales person said they performed about the same, given the over head of windows i question this? many thanks for help to all who responded gerard
i have a sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the motherboard. the same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) daughterboard. i have been using this system with a color monitor having a color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the bwtwo1, both on the same tube. i recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 sun mono monitor, and i would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the bwtwo0. i do not care if i loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the bwtwo1. after looking through the xsun man page i am not sure if this is possible. has anybody sucessfuly done this before? --matthew
the cose announcement specifies that motif will become the common gui. but what does this mean exactly? - do they mean that all "cose-complient" apps will have the motif look and feel? - do they mean that all "cose-complient" apps will use the motif toolkit api? - do they mean both of the above? - is it possible that there will be a motif-api complient toolkit with an openlook look & feel? - how about an olit/xview/oi/interviews api toolkit with a motif l & f? (i know oi already does this, but will this be considered cose-complient?) - will there be more than one "standard" toolkit api or l & f supported? - how does using tooltalk fit in with motif? this is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much knowledge about these questions off the net... feel free to e-mail or followup. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -- gil tene			"some days it just doesn't pay - -- devil@imp.hellnet.org	 to go to sleep in the morning." - -- devil@diablery.10a.com 					 - --------------------------------------------------------------------
the situation: running a fortran executable that creats an xterm. an option in the menu contained in the xterm runs a fortran subroutine that creats a tektronics-mode xterm for displaying some graphics. typing a <ret> while the tektronics-mode xterm (future reference to this will be "tek-term") is active makes the xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the xterm (i'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the tek-term stays on top of xterm. if what i'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.) the xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it. subsequent selections from the xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move the tek-term to the top. if the tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space, it stays an icon. the desired behavior: one of two options - 1. whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive one. 2. whenever the tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the xterm. what i think i need: a means of specifying that a xterm or tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a xterm and tek-term. these commands, would, i'd guess, need to be in the fortran or in the command that starts up the xterm and tek-term. other information: all this is taking place on a vt-1300 (a dec dumb x-windows terminal) connected to a vax running vms and motif. thanks for your time. if you've got any words of wisdom (other than "give up" ;-), please send email to jhcox@kodak.com

some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the server did not create cursors of that size. investigation showed that some x servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. the interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok, while a sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. so far i've also seen this behavior on ncd and phase-x x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps. actually, the ncd is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as ok. is xquerybestcursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct? i'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor! -- richard neitzel thor@thor.atd.ucar.edu torren med sitt skjegg national center for atmospheric research lokkar borni under sole-vegg box 3000 boulder, co 80307-3000	 gjo'i med sitt shinn 303-497-2057 jagar borni inn.

dear xperts, i'm developing an application that uses a motif slider to select an image file out of a directory. now i would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the mb1 pressed). as xmnshowvalue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, i thought of using an xtaddeventhandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name: xtaddeventhandler(scaleimage,button1motionmask, false, slidermoved, null); and in the eventhandler do a: while (xchecktypedwindowevent (display, event->window, motionnotify, &return)) ; xmscalegetvalue(scaleimage,&value); /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/ however, when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callbacks, with of co urse a null effect as my mb1 is not pressed to move the scale button. so what is goin g wrong? or is the a wrong approach to this problem? any hints are highly appreciated. --- phil

i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs/6000 running aix v3.2. i am having the following 2 problems. (1) many of my imakefile's have contructs like /**/#this is a makefile at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c preprocessor and into the makefile. most of the c preprocessors that i have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line. thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive. however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive. the cpp fails when it determines that "this" is not a known directive. i have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix. (2) several imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter. the aix cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok. if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, i would appreciate information about on your solutions. (perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed.) also, do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly? since i do not have easy access to news, a response to 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

a few days ago i posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an x app multiple times. it was pointed out that xtappinitialize() should never be called more than once. this helped. however, i am still having some problems. below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program. in the actual program, i am writing a library, callable from any other program. this means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables). in the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function. #include <x11/xlib.h> #include <xm/xm.h> #include <xm/pushb.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> void bla(xtappcontext app, widget top) { widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars xtappcontext theapp = app;	// of a class int junk = 0; display *dis = xtopendisplay(theapp, null, null, null, null, 0, &junk, null); widget box = xtvacreatemanagedwidget("blaaa", xmpushbuttonwidgetclass, topone, xmnheight, 50, xmnwidth, 50, null); xtrealizewidget(topone); for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "exit" button clicked { xevent event; xtappnextevent(theapp, &event); xtdispatchevent(&event); } xtdestroywidget(box); xtclosedisplay(dis); } // setitup - should be called once only void setitup(xtappcontext *app, widget *top) { int junk = 0; (*top)=xtappinitialize (app, "test", null, 0, &junk, null, null, null, 0); } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() { static xtappcontext app;	// use these every time called static widget top; static int setup = 0; if (!setup) { setitup(&app, &top); setup = 1; } bla(app, top); } // main - program which links to my library main() { for (int i=0;i<=20;i++) { doit(); printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point sleep(5); } } the problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (it is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog, despite the xtdestroywidget call). anyone see something i'm missing? thanks very much.

i posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out? how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case? what i want is ctrl+o and ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry. in ora vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "for information on how to specify translation tables see vol. 4...", this is so you know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource. if you go to vol. 4 it says, "likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. for example, the translation: 	shift<key>q:	quit() will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as the shift key (and the q key). this implies to me that setting xmnaccelerator to ctrl<key>o should do what i want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the control key, the shift key, and the o key. is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you can't use xtinstallaccelerators(). i am using motif 1.1.3 on a decstation 5000 but i have also tried it on an hp using motif 1.1.3 and 1.2. -- ********************************************************************** steve dennis internet: sdennis@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com software engineer applicon inc. ann arbor, michigan hail to the victors!!!
i'm an new to this. having found some files (public) to look into, i ftp'ed them to a system i have access to. i then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a pc-based file system. i access internet through modem access to a university mainframe. from the pc file server, i pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a sgi indigo (the sgi is not networked yet). when i try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or i get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. what i'm wondering about is the transfer of unix files (compressed, binary,ascii) about multiple platforms. my guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up. any help is appreciated. bob

i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose & configure events are handled. i have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, i made a translation table for the expose & configure events. the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a "fake" expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate expose struct) to draw the data. quest 1. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.) i get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right? any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? quest 2. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r5 i get no expose events whatsoever. do events and/or translation tables act differently in r5? thanks in advance steve -- ========================================================================================== steve kelley	umcp cs/umiacs			captain, i protest! internet:	skelley@umiacs.umd.edu		i am *not* a merry man! - worf

hi. i've looked in the faq and the o-reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as capslock and numlock. i can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there, but what if capslock is pressed in another window? i looked at xgrabkey() and decided it was definitely not what i wanted to do. i could find no convenience function to tell me that information. my question is this: is there a means of determining what the state of capslock and/or numlock is? an even more pointed question: is there an easy means of making an x keyboard act like a pc keyboard? ie, capslock is active, and the user presses shift-a, i'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'a'. any input is greatly appreciated. please respond via email. i will repost a summary of my findings. 			thanks, ralph
store and reply of mouse and keyboard events -------------------------------------------- to produce regression tests or automatic demo's we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events produced by a user. it should be possible to filter the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue an to store them in a file. this sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given to the server's queue as if a user is working. 1. exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all mouse and keyboard events (where)? 2. where one can catch these events to store them ? in our case the server's queue is on a x terminal (hp). where can we catch all events coming from a given server. if this is not possible, can we catch all events given to a certain client and how ? 3. where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ? is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ? thanks in advance ron.
hi, i'm new to this group so please bear with me! two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete, i've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview. i put together a quick test, and i've found that xputimage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that: (1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) xputimage is inefficient...or both! my question is, what is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? or am i stuck with xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...)? all help appreciated...thanks! derek ----------------------------------------------------------- | derek c. richardson | tel: (0223) 337548 x 37501 | | institute of astronomy | fax: (0223) 337523 | | cambridge, u.k. | | | cb3 0ha | e-mail: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk | -----------------------------------------------------------

[again, poseted for a friend] okay, i got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), lets try again: how can i tell if a colorcell is read-only? i want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once i start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color. once i determine if a cell is read-only, i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor() with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application. so far, the only way i've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up. it should error out if the cell is non-shareable. but life would be much easier if i could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly... any ideas? noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

usually when i start up an application, i first get the window outline on my display. i then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. yet when i specify the -geometry option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. the question now is: how can i override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? i've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour. thanks for any hints ---> robert ps: i'm working in plain x. ****************************************************************************** * robert gasch	 * der erste mai ist der tag an dem die stadt ins * * oracle engineering * freihe tritt und den staatlichen monopolanspruch * * de meern, nl	 * auf gewalt in frage stellt * * rgasch@nl.oracle.com * - einstuerzende neubauten * ******************************************************************************

a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation. when he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running. in this configuration, x windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine. however, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: unable to load iso 8859-1 font. the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes. further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window. if i start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems. it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts. note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables. other than rewriting the xterm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas? more info: this is the most recent mips workstation (r4000 i believe), with the most current operating system and running x11r5. it is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.
i have a problem when i'm using postscript. when i am working local on a sun sparcstaton ipc the postscript works good, but when i connect to the sun from a x-terminal i just get error messages that the postscript cannot connect to the news-display. why doesn't postscript work on an x-terminal? is there any way to make it work? henrik "henrik hjort" hjort

hello, i am testing a port of x11r5 to coherent, a unix clone os for intel architecture machines. i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program). the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display, one at a time. the characters appear to be too closely spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character, and so on. it looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character. there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters. if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where i should look to find it, it would be much appreciated. regards and thanks, jon dhuse. -- jon dhuse | internet: jdhuse@sedona.intel.com intel corp. ch3-69 | phone: (602)-554-2685 5000 w. chandler blvd. | any opinions expressed are my own, chandler, az 85226 | not my employer's.

(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). when using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, i had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal. the advantage of shm is that your x server doesn't grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging shm apps). shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes xshmattach();xshmputimage();xshmdetach(); on dec systems. and dec's 24 bit displays (like the ones i tend to use most often) don't seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the x server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one). in short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a good thing (minus shm if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.

i consider twm-style squeezed titles indispensable in a window manager. i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, i have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning. in case you're not familiar with squeezed titles, here's a crude picture: ====================== figure 1 ==================================== | | +---------+ +---------+ +=========+ | + title a + + title b + + title c + | +------------------------+ +------------------------------+ | + this is the + + window b hides window c, but + | + body of the + + you can still see c's title + | + window, window a + + which is squeezed right. + | +------------------------+ +------------------------------+ | ====================== figure 1 ==================================== squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than i really need, since i also insist on having a virtual wm. the only problem is that the title location is static, that is, it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming. therefore, i have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this: +---------+ + title a + +------------------------+ + this is the + + body of the + + window, window a + +------------------------+ to this: +---------+ + title a + +------------------------+ + this is the + + body of the + + window, window a + +------------------------+ =============== okay. so far, so good. now, how the heck do i get them to put this into the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? and the next xyztwm that i never heard of? one way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why i think it is a very good thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-) in case it isn't already clear why i think it's a very good thing, look back up at figure 1, and picture window a moved over on top of windows b and c; now window a's title hides window b's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is: +=========+ +---------+ +=========+ + title b + + title a + + title c + +-------------------------------------+ + this is the body of the window, + + window a, which is on top. + +-------------------------------------+ =================== the rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my x11r4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long. the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the executefunction() routine in menus.c: #ifdef shape 	case f_squeezeleft: 	{	static squeezeinfo left_squeeze = { j_left, 0, 0 }; 		if (deferexecution (context, func, scr->selectcursor)) 		 return true; 		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; 		setframeshape( tmp_win ); 		break; 	} 	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( j_right ) and 	squeezecenter ( j_center ) ... #endif ( of course, you also have to define f_squeezeleft in parse.h and add { "f.squeezeleft", fkeyword, f_squeezeleft }, ... and so forth ... to parse.c in order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file: button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter ================= about a year ago, i posted this, but our news was broken and i *think* it didn't get out. since then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, volume 19, issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. better to have a twm-style window manager, i think. -- ralph betza (fm), uunet!ssiny!gnohmon gnohmon@ssiny.com "the question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can think" - lenny dykstra
| | shared memory putimage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu, | nick kisseberth) looks interesting, but i need someone to point me to some | documentation. is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps? i'd also be interested in looking at the xview code | mentioned above... there is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). i have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the f.b. followed by a write) if your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in cpu main memory, the rates you can get through mit-shm are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your os's implementation of shared memory) to copyarea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphics device. one advanage of mit-shm is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. one disadvantage of the mit-shm is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill"). you have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. 	ken -- kenneth whaley			 (408) 748-6347 kubota pacific computer, inc.	 email: whaley@kpc.com 2630 walsh avenue santa clara, ca. 95051
hi xperts! i have a sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition. previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. my immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. this resulted in not loading openwindows. as a result of which none of the x-libraries got loaded. i am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/x11 files required for running x-windows and compiling my programs written for xlib and xaw. in a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libx*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/x11/* and /usr/include/x11/* . is this enough for running x-windows but i did not get /usr/lib/x11/fonts/ sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi and misc. when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. but the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space. are there any temporary suggestions before i get a 1.5 gb disk and load openwindows , to just have my x-windows running. thanks pramod --
can anyone give me some information, please ... i need (probably) to write one or more new motif widgets on the hp-ux platform. do i need the motif private header files and source, or can i make do with the public headers that are provided? "motif" includes xt in this context. one widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have already written, i am sure), and would therefore be probably be a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class. is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)? alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me, this might save me from having to write one! does it by any chance exist in motif 1.2 already (i do not yet have the spec)? answers appreciated, nicholas. -- nicholas young (+44 71 637 9111)

i have an applicationshell which uses a colormap created with xcreatecolormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit display. when i move the cursor over the window i get the "technicolor effect" - which is fine. basically, my program works. my problem/question is: when i popup a dialogshell to prompt the user for some input i want the xmndialogstyle to be set to xmdialog_primary_application_modal. the result is that if my cursor is over the dialogshell i get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the applicationshell (or any window other than the dialogshell) i get the default colormap. but i'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ window of my application, i get my colormap. any suggestions? thanks, david,

i am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics and imagery. the user of the widget will be able to specify, when creating it, whether it is to operate in x or gl mode. i have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button presses. they work fine when the widget is in x mode. in gl mode they only work when the widget (my gl/x widget) is a child of a manager. put another way, the translations do not work when the widget is configured in gl mode and is a child of a shell. does anyone know why this is happening? thanks in advance. bruce gendler bgendler@csc.com

(speaking of pcs at the moment.) 	i don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time if you are experienced. 	all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on unix (especially since unix is at least 500% more powerful than dos). -- \---------------------------------------------------------------------/ \ seth buffington 	u.s.s. gab 550 i 	817-565-2642 / \ seth@cs.unt.edu	seth@gab.unt.edu	unix operator / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
question: what is the exact entry (parameter and syntax please), in the x-terminal configuration file (loaded when the x-terminal boots), to add another system to the tcp/ip access control list? background: i have two unix systems, 1. an at&t 3b2 running x11r3 and mit's x11r4 and 2. a sun ss10 without any x. i want to have a window to the sun and the 3b2 on the ncd x-terminal at the same time. i can do this if i manually set the network parameter tcp/ip access control list to off, then login to my telnet session. not great! i've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed. either my syntax is wrong or the x11r3 implementation is bogus. i am trying to edit the ncd configuration file that is loaded when the ncd boots. no matter what entry i add or edit, the ncd still boots with the tcp/ip access control list containing only the 3b2. my manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!! thanks! ann marie barden 	abarden@afseo.eglin.af.mil

i am in the process of installing x11r5 on my sun sparcstation 2 and have run into a problem. i imagine it has something to do with a missing screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there in internet land might be able to help. i am installing it on a machine that already has openlook installed, and would like to have both installed concurrently. thus, i set it up to compile to my /usr/x11r5 directory. i worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings. i need it installed for pex-si, so i set all those appropriate flags. when i run it, however, i get a message along the lines of: getting interface configuration : operation not supported on socket sunopenframebuffer : inappropriate ioctl for device fatal server error : no screens found any ideas on how i can fix it? please respond by e-mail at the below address. thanks in advance. -dan -- "i do not want to be immortalized through my works; i want to be immortalized through not dying." -woody allen dan kirkpatrick | dept of electrical & computer engineering ~dsk@rice.edu | rice university uunet!rice.edu!dsk@uunet.uu.net | houston, tx
i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs/6000 running aix v3.2. i am having the following 2 problems. (1) many of my imakefile's have contructs like 		/**/#this is a makefile 	at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c 	preprocessor and into the makefile. most of the c preprocessors that 	i have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the 	line. thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the 	start of a directive. 	however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol 	as the start of a directive. the cpp fails when it determines 	that "this" is not a known directive. i have temporarily hacked my 	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better 	fix. (2) several imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular 	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter. the aix cpp 	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok. if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, i would appreciate information about on your solutions. (perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that i have not reviewed.) also, do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly? since i do not have easy access to news, a response to 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.
has anyone had experience porting imake to dos using a microsoft, watcom, or any other dos compiler? since i do not have easy access to news, a response to 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

[apologies if i'm answering something already answered in the faq. our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so i haven't seen the faq lately to check.] two ways: 1) when you start the xterm, you can use command line options: -n icon_name to set the icon label -t window_title to set the window title -title window_title equivalent to -t window_title 2) you can use escape sequences to change things on the fly: the basic escape sequence is: 	esc ] <p> ; <some_arbitary_text> bel where esc and bel are the ascii escape and bell characters, <p> is an ascii decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title, or both, and <some_arbitary_text> is your desired label string. hence, this command will set the window & icon title: echo "\033]0;your_title_goes_here\007\c" to set just the icon title: echo "\033]1;your_title_goes_here\007\c" to set just the window title: echo "\033]2;your_title_goes_here\007\c" of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax, depending on how the echo command works on your system and what shell you are using (i've shown system-v semantics under bourne or korn shells). [hint for sun os users: use /usr/5bin/echo instead of /bin/echo or csh's built-in echo. otherwise you'll have to embed literal esc and bel characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences.] if you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands. sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ... +-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+ | mark lanzo kd4qlz lanzo@tekelec.com 919-460-5576 | \\\/// | +-------------------------------------------------------+---- \xx/ -------+

(we tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem.) the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows: 1) use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm" 2) use "olwm", with resource "*wmtimeout: 10" 3) only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed. this is obviously working around some bug somewhere. thanks -- chris ho-stuart
i am working on an x-window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing. i am using x11r4 and motif 1.1 currently, although i will also be working with open look in the future. what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window. let's say, for example, that window a is on top of window b in the window hierarchy. normally, if the user clicks the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of window a. under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window a. from the research and testing i've done so far, it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this case motif. i haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard x window functions. i can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events, but i can't find any way to tell motif not to make the switch. the temporary solution i've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works. when i detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed, i manually force the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call and beep with the xbell function. this provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice. does anyone know how i can tell motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when i don't want the window order switch to actually take place? respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup. cheers.... randall *************************************************************************** * randall severy * uunet: uunet!ge!severy * * ge information services * internet: ge!severy@uunet.uu.net * * 401 n. washington st. mc05a * genie: rsevery * * rockville, md 20850 usa * phone: +1-301-340-4543 * ***************************************************************************

hello-- i'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as x. a friend and i are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by dr. fred brooks at unc-chapel hill. while we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an x-windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget. unfortunately, i've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various x faqs, or x manuals that i've seen. does anyone have some type of frequency data, like how many copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and things of that sort? or, barring that, a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that i can munge on myself? any and all help would be very appreciated. many thanks, ---mark =============================================================================== mark a. deloura deloura@cs.unc.edu u of north carolina, chapel hill

(if you have keyboardfocuspolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on mb1). -- david brooks					dbrooks@osf.org open software foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks showres soote my foote
i am considering making a reasonably large application for free distribution (probably copylefted). i am going to use x. now i'm bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has created. i've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment. most of the tools here were produced with the athena widget set, or x intrinsics or xw (??). in my humble opinion, they look like crap. i don't know, however, if this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers. i would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm. i understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits. i am getting linux, so i will have interviews, but i don't know how it will look. i get the impression andrew is from the fsf, but i don't know what it looks like either. if you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, i would be much obliged. which are free? which are the best? which are portable? which looks nice? which is not a resource hog? also, if you happen to know which are available on linux and/or sun, that would be a big help too. thanks in advance.

has anyone found a fix for the following problem? client software:	sunos 4.1.1, x11r5 server hardware:	sun ipc server software:	sunos 4.1.1, open windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37) a motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the openwindows 3.0 server (xnews). the pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. sometimes pressing <return> will unstick the application but not usually. it looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. if i log in from another terminal and kill the motif application then everything gets back to normal. the same application when run against other x servers (including mit x11r5 xsun, decwindows, tektronix x terminal) has no problems. this is obviously a openwindows problem but i need a work-around since most of our customers are openwindows users. i have tried the following things: 1. installing the latest version of the openwindows server patch (100444-37). 2. using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm. 3. applying the patch specified in the motif faq (question 110). this had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. it did seem to help, but i was still able to get the application to hang. repeat by: this is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times. click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up) click and release on a menu item repeat until application hangs any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance. -- skip koppenhaver skip@eco.twg.com

tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw. we have several network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. these are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with dns, requiring much manual manipulation of the name table. we also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle tcp streams and 5) could not read sniffer files. however, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified. tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features. tcpview has been tested on a decstation 5000 and sun 4 under ultrix 4.2 and sunos 4.1 respectively. it should work on the same systems as tcpdump. it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun. to build tcpview you will need motif 1.1 or better. the following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.z	sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.z	dec mips ultrix 4.2 binaries what tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional 	processing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- changes to tcpdump 2.2.1 new features: now reads and writes network general sniffer files. when used with '-r', the file type will be automatically detected. can now read in (and use) an snmp mib file. the hex format has been changed. new time options have been added. options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in tcp packets. bugs were fixed in the relative tcp sequence numbers. (-s flag) new flags: -r	read sniffer file. not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -w	write a sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format. 	sample output: 16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: s 0:0(0) win 16384 0000 45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02 | e..(....<.|.._p. 0010 80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00 | ...d....[.j..... 0020 50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 | p.@.n......... -x	print tcp data in hexdump format (used with -z) -z	write tcp data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp) -z	write frames and tcp data to stdout martin m. hunt martinh@cac.washington.edu networks & distributed computing university of washington -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- martin hunt martinh@cac.washington.edu networks and distributed computing university of washington		
we developed a toolkit running on the x window system. the toolkit copes with any languages based on x11r5's i18n facility. as you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from mit's x11r5 release -- xsi and ximp. our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi. our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. in order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. this means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ascii and kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. in this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so. we need a function to do this. the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. we could not find any public x11r5 function to do that and inevitably, used xsi's internal functions to construct that function. the following is the source code of that function 'decomposecharacterset()'. //i18n.h // this may look like c code, but it is really -*- c++ -*- // $id: i18n.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima exp iima $ #ifndef _i18n_h #define _i18n_h #include <x11/xlib.h> extern int decomposecharacterset(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* in */ 				 int wc_len,		/* in */ 				 char *buf,		/* out */ 				 int *buflen,		/* in/out */ 				 int *scanned_len,	/* out */ 				 char **charset);	/* out */ extern xmstring wchartoxmstring(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern xmstringcharset charsetofwchar(const wchar_t wc); #endif /* _i18n_h */ //i18n.cc /* $id: i18n.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima exp $ */ #include <stdlib.h> #include <x11/xlibint.h> #include <xm/xm.h> #include "i18n.h" extern "c" { #include <x11/wchar.h> #define _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxx_xwcdecomposeglyphcharset #define _xmbfscs xxx_xmbfscs #define _xmbctidtocsid xxx_xmbctidtocsid #include "xlocaleint.h" #undef _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset #undef _xmbfscs #undef _xmbctidtocsid extern int _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset(xlocale, const wchar_t*, int, 					 char*, int*, int*, int*); extern charset *_xmbfscs(xlocale, _csid); extern _csid _xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, _csid); }; int decomposecharacterset(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* in */ 			 int wc_len,		/* in */ 			 char *buf,		/* out */ 			 int *buf_len,		/* in/out */ 			 int *scanned_len,	/* out */ 			 char **charset)	/* out */ { xlocale xlocale = _xfallbackconvert(); int ctid; int status; charset *xcharset; status = _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf, 				 buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid); if (status == success) { 	xcharset = _xmbfscs(xlocale, _xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid)); 	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : null; } else 	*charset = null; return status; } ---------------- an included file above, "xlocaleint.h", is also xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled. a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hp-ux9.01. when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing: _xmbctidtocsid (code) _xmbfscs (code) _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset (code) _xfallbackconvert (code) we had used mit release version of x11r5 and its xsi implementation until hp-up9.0 and ran applications successfully. one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hp's x11r5 until the os 9.0 and we had no way to know how hp's r5 would be implemented. we had hoped xsi's popularity and used its internal functions. the hp's linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented. we observe from hp's libx11.a, they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mit's vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in mit's ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution. my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposecharacterset()' listed above. is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? if it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in hp's x11r5 as we did for mit's r5. in order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. we have no way to find out that without any hp's x11r5 source files. we want to know how we can use that for our goal. any help or comments would be highly appreciated. i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hp's implementation. thank you. -- 				takeshi inoue 				inoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jp 				yokogawa electric corporation 				open systems laboratory	0422(52)5557

hello folks, i'm seeing these errors when i try to modify my key map: mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x i've added a line in the start up file before the line that starts mwm. it looks like the following: xmodmap keymapfile mwm i think that the problem has to do with a conflict between function keys f1 through f7 which already have assigned functions (e.g. move, minimize, etc). the odd thing is that i don't see these errors if i run xmodmap keymapfile from an xterm. can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically f1 through f7 and not have mwm (motif window manager) complain. i realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to implement, not time to learn how to implement. terry

hi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem i'm having with mit x11r5's editres, in particular under twm variants. for a start, 9 times out of 10 (but not always) editres won't grab a widget tree when running on our ncd (decwindows) xterms, which i'm told will be fixed when the r5 (not r4) xdm is installed. ok, so i tried running it on a sun, running real r5, on the same network - i get a widget tree, but it's always for 'twm icon manager' anybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that i should look at? thanks, k
hi xperts, this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-( i can't believe there is no xview wizards any more 8-)... i'm using sliders in my xview apps, usually with editable numeric field. but i seem to have no control over the length of this field. in some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by panel_max_value! as i understand, panel_value_display_length, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit: 	/* panel_multiline_text_item, panel_numeric_text_item, 	 * panel_slider_item and panel_text_item attributes 	 */ 	panel_notify_level	= panel_attr(attr_enum,			 152), 	panel_value_display_length	= panel_attr(attr_int,		 182), which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. but 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: bad attribute, and returns value 0. strange thing is that dec's port of xview gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not sun's xview... can someone share his experience in managing sliders in xview with me, and clear this problem? any help is very much appreciated. yuri yuri@uk.ac.hw.phy
i'm writing an x server for some video-generation equipment. the hardware is "truecolor" in yuv space; in x terms it has a 24-bit static color visual. i would really like to have the server just present this static visual, but i'm not sure if this will be acceptable to "most" x clients. the three problems i see are: 1) the colormap, though huge, is static. 2) all pixels would be 3 bytes wide. 3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space, the translation rgb->yuv will introduce some rounding error. being more of a server guy than a client guy, i ask: will these limitations thwart many x clients? or will most of the x stuff floating around blithely accept what they're given? i could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, but i'd rather avoid this if not necessary. i know there are no absolutes, but i'd appreciate hearing people's opinions and suggestions. thanks! -- frederick g. m. roeber | cern -- european center for nuclear research e-mail: roeber@cern.ch or roeber@caltech.edu | work: +41 22 767 31 80 r-mail: cern/ppe, 1211 geneva 23, switzerland | home: +33 50 20 82 99

we recently got an ncd x-terminal to evaluate. this is running xremote over a serial line. i wanted to get some measurement of response time, so i wrote a small xlib program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first expose event to itself. the program times the delay from sending the event, to receiving it. i thought this was the simplest way to test client/x-server round-trip delays. it's a similar concept to the ping(8c) program. is this a valid test to perform ? i've also tried the xbench program, available from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but i just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive response time. has anyone got any ideas on this subject ? thanks. andrew.

excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 23-apr-93 x toolkits paul prescod@undergrad.m (1132) > i get the impression andrew is from the fsf, but i don't know what it > looks like either. the andrew user interface system is supported, maintained, enhanced, and distributed by the andrew consortium, carnegie mellon. the distribution terms are those of the x consortium, not the gnu public license. thus anyone can commercially exploit the andrew code without restriction. (to encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the latest versions until consortium members have had an opportunity to explore the new capabilities.) to se what auis looks like, you can try a remote demo. you need an x server (r5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet. give the command 	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu for instructions. note: the demo version does not use the motif-look-and-feel scrollbar, but one is available. you can use it on the demo by changing an option in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor. the andrew toolkit component of auis is ideal if you want to build applications using compound documents. andrew's major feature is its architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in figure in text, for example. this architecture extends to areas not usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and printing. andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the xr6 tape in december.) fred hansen director, andrew consortium

does anybody have an x server for nt that they're willing to share files or experiences? bill steer westinghouse
we have an old sun3/60 here which gets occasional use. when x11r5 is started on it any console messages during startup are undeletable. after x is fully started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages that arrive before this starts go to the plain console. "refresh window" fails to remove them. the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of the screen obscuring anything else below them. at boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers - /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1. we're running x in color, and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are on the b/w framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted. my question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid of these messages? please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk. hugh mcintyre. inmos ltd., bristol, uk. (btw: sunos 4.0.3, x11r5, mwm). ps: i know i can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - i'm looking for a more general solution).

"the x window system", "x", "x11", and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name. in fact, some of them are *trademarked* names. the fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point. as for the trade publications that promulgate things like "x window" or "x.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists*. would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right? would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong? popular usage is as it may be, but i for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness. >indeed, the fact that x won out over news >was really down to popular opinion (i know, we all think it's(!) technically >superior as well!). x11 technically superior to news? well, in *some* alternate universe perhaps ...

i am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the pd motif c++ bindings. i got over 40 replies in about one week of people interested in such a list, and the software has now been properly installed, so the list is now up and running. for those interested in joining, please send e-mail to that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'. the blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original announcement for where motif++ can be obtained. enjoy! 8< - 8< - welcome to the motif++ mailing list! the motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to motif++, the pd c++ wrapper library for motif, where people can ask questions about motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. all requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc. should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl all e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to messages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded from auto-replies. enjoy! ronald van loon | in theory, there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl) | between theory and practice. 3dcv group, utrecht | the netherlands | in practice however, there is. 8< - 8< - hello motif world, over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to the motif++ bindings. imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added. this is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. next release will incorporate some improvements by stefan schwarz, and possibly will support x11r5 and motif 1.2.x. note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies. here is the original announcement: history the university of lowell, supported by a grant of the open software foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates motif widgets in c++ classes. all resources of these widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. the library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. however, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under x11r3. due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the university of lowell. i, ronald van loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the lowell bindings, fixing the bugs i came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by rick murphy at dec). new release i am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the motif++ bindings. this release offers: - full motif1.1 and x11r4 support - support for xbae widgetset - two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate progress in an application. - imake support. nb: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake 		 and its config files on your site. i have tried to 		 provide the bindings with a standard makefile, tweakable 		 for those unfortunates without imake. i have not severely 		 tested the standard makefile though. contact me if you 		 have problems. the reason for calling this a gamma 		 release lies in the fact that i do not have a multitude 		 of platforms to test the imake-files on. - lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - an article i wrote on the usage of motif, x and c++, previously posted on usenet. where to get the new motif bindings ftp: anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/x11. note: please be patient as the network link is quite slow. please do not ftp large files during working hours. also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. e-mail: those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and i will send the bindings by e-mail. request those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and i will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). more information contact me at "rvloon@cv.ruu.nl". if you are desperate, then you can call me at +31 30 506711 (that is utrecht, the netherlands; those within the netherlands call 030-506711). enjoy! -- ronald van loon | in theory, there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl) | between theory and practice. 3dcv group, utrecht | the netherlands | in practice however, there is.

the xview version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section of x11r5 included the source to the textedit program. i'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a tooltalk-like message server, and maybe for tooltalk while i'm at it, since the sun-supplied textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk. however, the sources in the r5 contrib area seem to be for an older version of textedit than the version shipped with openwindows 3. for example, the own 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview knows nothing about drag and drop. the textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50, dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the own 3.0 binary says: textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro ds_relname.c 1.7 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro so, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available? i'd really like to work from the latest source if possible. please reply by email, and i'll post a summary if there's enough interest. -- matt landau			waiting for a flash of enlightenment matt@centerline.com			 in all this blood and thunder
i have noticed in framemaker 3.1x on both the sgi and sun platforms that certain dialogs, such as "column layout..." for example, respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is pointer. how is this done? i would like to emulate this behavior in my application. it seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus. alternatively, i'm open to any suggestions as to what is the "right" way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus policy is pointer. allen barnett (whose wife graciously allowed to use her account)
i'm writing an application running under x (using motif), and i need to do some stuff when the application quits. now, when i shut down my x windows session, it doesn't seem to send a sigterm (or whatever) signal to my application (i'm trapping various signals like that). therefore, i thought i could use an x signal to check for my top level window being destroyed. however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows. is there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed (some field to check or some combination of events?). replies by e-mail please and i will summarise. thanks for any help, ian -- // // // ian@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk // // //
dear folks: it's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, xavier, an audio and video extension to interviews. xavier(extension av class for interviews) is a c++ class library that adds multimedia capability to interviews. it allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects. specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in interviews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for interviews need to be changed via a patch file). currently, the xavier audio classes are only supported on sun workstations with an audio interface, such as the sparcstation2. xavier has been tested in the following environments: sun: machine : sparcserver470 sparcstation-ipc os : sun-os4.1.1 or later c++ : sun c++ ver2.1 nec(ews): machine : ews4800/210,230 os : ews-ux/v(rel4.0) wsos41 release5.1,release5.2 c++ : c++ release3.1 it can be obtained via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/ (xavier.large-demo.tar, and xavier.tar) we are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding xavier. if you are interested, please contact xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. i will add your e-mail address to our list.

i'm working on an x11r5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps. the x11r5 documentation says: "usually, a window manager creates these colormaps." i wonder what window manager the writer had in mind. neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps. of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps. however, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap. when i use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black. so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid. perhaps if every application used standard colormaps, things would be wonderful. but not many applications seem to use standard colormaps. finally, the operation of the functions xmugetcolormapallocation, xmustandardcolormap, and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation. according to the section 14.3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation (p. 436): for grayscale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and base_pixel members are defined. the other members are ignored. to compute a grayscale pixel value, use the following expression: (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xffffffff xmugetcolormapallocation, defined in mit/lib/xmu/cmapalloc.c, is used by xmulookupstandardcolormap, defined in mit/lib/xmu/lookupcmap.c to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the call to xmustandardcolormap. when the rgb_gray_map property is specified, xmugetcolormapallocation sets red_max to 30% of the total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number. referring to section 14.3, one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale. when the rgb_gray_map property is specified, xmustandardcolormap, defined in mit/lib/xmu/stdcmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal to 1. referring to section 14.3, one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored. when red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, xmucreatecolormap, defined in mit/lib/xmu/crcmap.c, constructs a gray map. the sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives the maximum gray value. referring to section 14.3, on would expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.
i am in the process of modifying an x application that uses xlib. i'd like to include a timer-driven facility (for network polling), but cannot see how to do it using xlib. i know it can be done with xaw, using xtappaddtimeout and xttimercallbackproc. how do i do the same using xlib? thanks for any help. please email. -- dave wilson computing centre, rhodes university grahamstown, south africa

hi all! i tried to run softpc, a pc emulation software program, installed on a silicon graphics workstation from a human design system (hds) x terminal, and everything went fine, except the fonts could not be converted from one type of format to the other - hds uses different font format from sgi worksation. so, i have the following questions: 1. how do you resolve different font formats from different machines? 2. is there a program to convert one type of font format to another? if you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please let me know. your help will be greatly appreciated! thank you in advance for your help and information. tom nguen edwind@lims01.lerc.nasa.gov

i am *almost* done porting xfree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware, but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat commonplace, so i'm sending a net-feeler. i have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit 720x280 display. the server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd | xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be. however, the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long. after a bit of experimentation, it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which isn't exactly divisible by four. changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define bitmap_scanline_pad 32 #define log2_bitmap_pad		5 #define log2_bytes_per_scanline_pad	2 --- to: --- #define bitmap_scanline_pad 16 #define log2_bitmap_pad		4 #define log2_bytes_per_scanline_pad	2 --- was not exactly the right solution. how do i tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte boundries? i'm using a customized version of xfree86v1.2, under mach 3.0. thanks brian
these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions. 1. if my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping() for each key press with a modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table. i would like to do it the second way, but i can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers. i know that when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping() a mappingnotify event is generated (non-maskable) which i can pick up and modify my internal table. but, i don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap. if i use xt, all o'reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by xt...'. if i use xlib, ala xnextevent(), i get nothing. this all stems from problems with users of the sun 4/5 keyboard and the numlock; plus various alt/meta/etc. modifier requirements. 2. i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window. i want it at the same y coord, and their right/left sides touching. what i need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window manager's border for the main window. this should ring a bell with anyone who has called xtmovewidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border. any help would be most appreciated. darcy darcy_mccallum@mentorg.com
i have the following problem on x11r5 servers. when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the save under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored. normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent. when exposuremask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws. everything works fine with x11r4. is this something that is changed between x11r4 and x11r5 (obvious)? is it something i do wrong? is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? is this a bug in x11 release 5? greetings, -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- hans bos 	 domain : hans@xelion.nl xelion bv uucp : ...!sun4nl!xelion!hans postbus 88 phone : +31 15 622121
i posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (then again i've had some problems with the mail system). apologies if this appears for the second time: usually when i start up an application, i first get the window outline on my display. i then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. yet when i specify the -geometry option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. the question now is: how can i override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? i've tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour. thanks for any hints ---> robert ps: i'm working in plain x, using tvtwm. ****************************************************************************** * robert gasch * der erste mai ist der tag an dem die stadt ins * * oracle engineering * freihe tritt und den staatlichen monopolanspruch * * de meern, nl * auf gewalt in frage stellt * * rgasch@nl.oracle.com * - einstuerzende neubauten * ****************************************************************************** ----------------------- headers ------------------------ >from uupsi7!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xpert-mailer thu apr 22 17:24:28 1993 remote from aolsys received: from uupsi7 by aolsys.aol.com id aa19841; thu, 22 apr 93 17:10:35 edt received: from srmftp.psi.com by uu7.psi.com (5.65b/4.0.071791-psi/psinet) via smtp; id aa02784 for ; thu, 22 apr 93 12:04:36 -0400 received: from expo.lcs.mit.edu by srmftp.psi.com (4.1/3.1.072291-psi/psinet) id aa17104; thu, 22 apr 93 10:19:31 edt received: by expo.lcs.mit.edu; thu, 22 apr 93 06:57:38 -0400 received: from enterpoop.mit.edu by expo.lcs.mit.edu; thu, 22 apr 93 06:57:37 -0400 received: by enterpoop.mit.edu (5.57/4.7) id aa27271; thu, 22 apr 93 06:57:14 -0400 received: from usenet by enterpoop with netnewsfor xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu (xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu);contact usenet@enterpoop if you have questions. to: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu date: 22 apr 93 08:09:35 gmt from: rgasch@nl.oracle.com (robert gasch) message-id: <3873@nlsun1.oracle.nl> organization: oracle europe subject: overriding default behaviour

hi there (i posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so i'm posting here.) i'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation (an hp 720). it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets. however, this digitiser makes use of the serial port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver. the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/x11/x*devices file (* = display number). i shouldn't think i would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work. but maybe i'm wrong. am i? what i would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for x (rather than just as input to a specific x application)? if so, what were the steps required for installation? did you need a special device driver? did the manufacturer supply it? are there generic public domain device drivers around? (i understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.) any help would be greatly appreciated. cheers - vaughan -- vaughan clarkson ___________ email: vaughan@ewd.dsto.gov.au engineering ph.d. student | phone: +61-8-259-6486 & glider pilot			 ^ fax: +61-8-259-5254 ---------------------------------(_)---------------------------------

i've found a problem in the use of xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. i decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling xdefinecursor from a sig_alrm signal handler. this is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). i was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. i found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the sig_alrm handler was called during a xdrawstring call. xdrawstring was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the xdefinecursor was called. presumably the (internal) structure that xdrawstring was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent xdefinecursor to where it shouldn't have been. has anyone else experienced this? is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? or should bcopy() be atomic. we are running on sgi irix 4.0.1 with x11r4. -- regards, martin /\/\ : martin visser - electrical / software engineer / / /\ : engineering technology department / / / \ : bhp steel - slab and plate products division / / / /\ \ : p.o. box 1854 wollongong nsw 2500 australia \ \/ / / / : phone +61-42-75-7522 ext. 6207 \ / / / : fax +61-42-75-7038 \/\/\/ : e-mail visser@itwol.bhp.com.au

hi ppl, i am running xfree386 under linux sls1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. i have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. i have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for x called xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/x11, so i ran xmodmap /usr/lib/x11/xmodmap.gr. my first impression was very good, i was able to get z and y straight :) there's still a little problem i can't solve however: i cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets. the alt-gr key doesn't seem to work. i tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. looking up its keycode (113) in the xmodmap i found the entry "mode_switch" which doesn't ring any bell. the entries for the keys i cannot use seem to be correct. example: keycode xx = ssharp questn backslash the first 2 entries i can even get at. the first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd?? my guess is that it should be the key with alt-gr but it isn't. if anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them, help would be appreciated. cu alaric

i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes and collects data from that nodes periodically. i need to display this data on my x application. i tried to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok. but the problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. so i doesn't returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and it doesn't respond to users input. i button press events are queued and exected after server finished its task. now i am going to try appaddinput call. so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe. i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client which is my x application will read. now i have some doubts which you may be able to clarify. 1) when i fork a process. it will create to copy of my process. right !! now what does this two copies mean? two shells. where should i fork my application. what are the responsibilities of this processes. how should i call this processes.? 2) can i fork more than one processes. so that i can read from more than one servers input. thanks samir patel ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// spatel@cs.tamu.edu \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

i'm trying to turn on xauthorization using mit-magic-cookie on my servers (cpu heads, hp700rx xterminals), but i'm running into a couple of problems. first, at least one of our applications (maple) doesn't seem to understand how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization turned on. second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and i really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .xauthority file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support xauthorization. so, what i would like to do is turn on mit-magic-cookie by default, with non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based authorization. (yes, i know how to turn it off by changing the xconfig file for the heads and the client authorize setting for the xterminals, but non-privileged users can't do this.) i've checked with the hp support line, and there doesn't appear to be a way. can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what i want? btw, i'm running hpux 9.0, and vue 3.0. thanks in advance, rick -- rick mcteague electrical engineering department, speed scientific school university of louisville, louisville, ky 40292 (502) 588-7020 internet: sysrick@starbase.spd.louisville.edu disclaimer: i'm a stand-up comedian; if anyone takes me seriously, i'm doing something wrong!

how can i capture buttonpress/buttonrelease events in multiple clients? i want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen. i can get keypress/keyrelease and pointer motion events, but if the user is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move) i can't capture the events. the o'reilly xlib programming manual (vol. 1) says on page 252; "only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, due to the grab that automatically takes place." any help would be appreciated. deryl steinert dus@ornl.gov

i am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my linux system. - it must be free. - it must run on standard (monochrome) x with a small screen size (800x600) no motif/openlook etc. - it must compile under linux with gcc/g++. most generic unix software works ok. - it must produce postscript files that i can include into latex documents with dvips. or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps. - it must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable). i know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. i have no experience with any of them. features i would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. if i move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing, stay connected. ideally i want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it. i just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs? how demanding are the programs with respect to disk space, memory and cpu usage? are any of the programs known to work on linux with monochrome x? lennart.
the andrew consortium of the school of computer science at carnegie mellon is pleased to announce auis 5.1.1 for aix3.2 4/26/93 the andrew user interface system version 5.1 (our cdrom version) was developed for aix version 3.1 on the ibm rs/6000 and many other platforms. to accomodate aix version 3.2, we have created a patch to the sources. the patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory ./aixpatch. for those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address below. the base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a cdrom or ftp'ed from the same host. note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows auis to compile under aix3.2. ----------- the andrew user interface system (auis) is a comprehensive environment on top of x11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media applications and documents. a major advantage of auis is the capability to recursively embed objects. thus, one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but also contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations, and so on. these embedded objects can themselves contain other objects, including text. auis has three components: the andrew user environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell interface, and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects. the andrew toolkit (atk) is a portable, object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another. with the toolkit, programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system. the andrew message system (ams) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards. ams supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced features including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails of related messages, and subscription management. it also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations. the current public release of andrew, version 5.1, includes support for the new internet mime (multipurpose internet mail extensions) standards for multipart, multimedia mail. a newer release, 5.2, for members of the andrew consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences. remote andrew demo service you can try out andrew from your own work station via the remote andrew demo service. you need a host machine on the internet running the x11 window system. you'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate through the interactive andrew tour, and use the andrew message system to browse through a few of cmu's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups. to get started with the remote andrew demo service, simply run the following command on your machine: 	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu the service will give you further instructions. more information about andrew is available from: information requests andrew consortium carnegie mellon university smith hall 106 5000 forbes avenue pittsburgh, pa 15213-3890 usa phone: +1-412-268-6710 fax: +1-412-682-6938 info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu contact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information.
repost: i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose & configure events are handled. i have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, i made a translation table for the expose & configure events. the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a "fake" expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate expose struct) to draw the data. quest 1. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.) i get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right? any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? quest 2. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r5 i get no expose events whatsoever. do events and/or translation tables act differently in r5? thanks in advance -- ==================================================================================== steve kelley	umcp cs/umiacs			captain, i protest! 		skelley@umiacs.umd.edu		i am *not* a merry man! - worf

one way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the xevent that the xaddeventhandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the show_mouse_position function. if the xevent arrive in this function as xevent p_event; then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. so, you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. in case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. by the way, you mentioned the button1motionmask and if anyone can help me with these motionmasks i would be grateful. i can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. in essence i would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. unfortunately, the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button. any ideas, eps

hello!!! the title just about says it all. i need a list of the bugs for motif 1.2. thanks, neal
i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif, but i'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part. does anyone know anything about this problem........ - i am using an xmtextfield, and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or kanji) either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring. the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed, the text is getting truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables lang (more specifically lc_all). when they are set to japanese, the text gets truncated. when they are set to english, everything works fine. i am taking the default for xmncolumns. (please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual application, just in my sample code to make things easier) 	 - i am running motif 1.2, x11r5 via hpux9.01. my test program is set up to handle 16 bit kanji characters. i have remembered to do xtsetlanguageproc() prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and textfield is initially created with uil. the problem does not happen with xmtext. unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it. my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese, but since i don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion, or if you want the sample program. thanks!!!!!!!! - susan swalker@bbn.com 617-873-8190

(actually, things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the same.) the solution is for the intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information in reparentnotify events. this has been implemented and is available in x11r5 public fix 20. this is xbug 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details. s'marks -- stuart w. marks				stuart.marks@eng.sun.com window systems technology		2550 garcia ave. m/s 21-228 sunsoft, inc.				mountain view, ca 94043
i don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the xview xv_get() function: x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, xv_x); y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, xv_y); for example, if i set xv_x & xv_y to 50,50 the frame comes up in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. but later on xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame, xv_?). my frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out (by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. what gives? any help most appreciated! derek p.s. on a related subject, is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames, etc.? ----------------------------------------------------------- | derek c. richardson | tel: (0223) 337548 x 37501 | | institute of astronomy | fax: (0223) 337523 | | cambridge, u.k. | | | cb3 0ha | e-mail: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk | -----------------------------------------------------------

we are planning on buying 15-20 x terminals. i have the article from jim morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information that will help me decide which to buy. the terminals will be connected to a dec 3000/400 axp with 96mb ram, running osf/1. from what i have found out so far, it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (x11, window manager, xterm, etc.), and that in order to do this we need n mb ram in the xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who i talk to). what should i be looking for? what sort of questions should i be asking the salespeople? thanks trevor j. smedley - smedley@tuns.ca school of computer science technical university of nova scotia

we are making a transition from nextstep to x-windows. i am trying to find the best gui tool for our needs. i have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). i realize that there are differences but i don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. the tools i have looked at so far are uim/x, x-designer, tele-use, tcl/tk,interviews, and suit. so far i've drawn the following conclusions: 1) the builder for interviews is not very mature, bad docs 2) tele-use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) uim/x & x-designer seem about the same, even though x-designer does not have a interpreter (i'll by centerline if i need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) i know very little about the ics builder (just have the sales info) 6) due to a corporate agreement x-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) for the time i'm spending i could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) we will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. is there another news group for this ? 10) suit cost too much for comercial development. i'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products. thanks --- *	bruce trvalik aoa-----------------* * (617)864-0201 check your mind at the door - the band that time forgot *	moose@aoa.utc.com * aoa!moose@bbn.com

hi, i am using xdm on x11r5 with ow3 and xview3 on sun3s and sparcs running sunos 4.1.1. prior to using xdm, i used to set path and other environment variables (like manpath, helppath, arch, etc) in my .login file. with xdm, the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. i used the "displaymanager._0.userpath" resource in /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the path variable. but i am having problems passing anything else!!! i tried execing $home/.login in /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xsession but that didn't help. i also tried using 	"displaymanager.exportlist: helppath manpath arch" which didn't work either. i would appreciate any help on this matter. thanks in advance, shash +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ + shash chatterjee email: fwr8bv@fin.af.mil + + ec software phone: (817) 763-1495 + + lockheed fort worth company fax: (817) 777-2115 + + p.o. box 748, mz1719 + + ft. worth, tx 76101 + +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
hello, our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications. we are trying to use action translation tables to implement this. we have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application. the xt calls we make are included below. it would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations, and also accomplish it for multiple applications. if someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated. platform: sun sparc w/ x11r4 & motif 1.1.4 *********************************************************************** static xtactionsrec actionstable[] = { {"up", do_up}, {"right", do_right}, {"middle", do_middle}, {"left", do_left}, {"down", do_down}, 	{"bye", quit}, }; static char defaulttranslations[] = 		"<key>kp_8: up() \n\ 		 <key>kp_6: right() \n\ 		 <key>kp_5: middle() \n\ 		 <key>kp_4: left() \n\ 		 <key>kp_2: down() \n\ 		 <key>kp_1: bye()"; xttranslations	trans_table, trans_table2; (. . .) xtaddactions(actionstable, xtnumber(actionstable)); trans_table = xtparsetranslationtable(defaulttranslations); widget = xtcreatemanagedwidget("msg", xmpushbuttonwidgetclass, 		form, wargs, n); xtoverridetranslations(widget, trans_table); ***********************************************************************

our corporate wan is as unique as any other. the usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave. the only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to ireland that they often use to run a dos text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the dvx machine behind me. since the server end is (or was) always at this end (california) it is faster to remotely run the client via desqview x and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server. as i warned you, this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k isdn link. running word for windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. let's break it into pieces and look at it. tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from windows calls into x. popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic. restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be. does the server that it's displaying on have backing store? if so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. if no backing store, then what was being covered up? if it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily. if it was a full color backdrop of ren & stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bit by bit. dvx will do its level best to only redraw that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted. assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent. worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls. > > >>it all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going >>to see a slowdown from x-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all >>doing network things also...) >>-- > >what do you mean by network things?

	greetings, 	we have a network of ~20 sun workstations, running sunos 4.1.1 and openwindows 3. 7 of these are sun 3's that we have modified to run seth robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals. we use xdm (x11r4) to manage the displays. 	when we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. with 7 clients to 1 sparc 2, the sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. 	let me try to be precise: the user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away. (when this was the department chair, it was kind of cute). we poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault. our current theory is that olwm (the sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). 	has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? 	can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? 	how about obvious gimmes? 	and, of course, any ideas on how to solve it? 	any ideas are greatly appreciated. greg owen { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu, gowen@jade.tufts.edu } systems programmer and ta, tufts university computer science dept. personal info: gcs/go d++ -p+ c+++ m*/m- s++/- g+ w+/w-- x+ email for explanation if interested...

we're looking at various x11 clients for pc's and we're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products. are any notably efficient (fast)? are any notably inefficient? i assume that a graphics accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now i'm looking at ico running on xoftware/32 for windows sitting on the distinct tcp/ip platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the sparc10's console. what are the key ways of improving performance for pc (presumably windows) clients? also, what about async solutions? (yes, i appreciate that it will be *much* slower even with v.42bis.) i'm in the process of installing ppp (with header compression). how does that compare to cslip? i've seen a product called xremote by ncd that promises to be pretty efficient, but are there comparable products out there? if we're looking for efficiency for async, pc clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard ppp w/ compression and xremote? any information would be greatly appreciated. i'm still taking in all the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great. (i get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.) thanks. -- rob -- rob ryan, system constructs inc. rryan@panix.com
most graphics systems i have seen have drawing routines that also specify a color for drawing, like drawpoint(x,y,color) or drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) with x, i have to do something like xsetforeground(current_color) xdrawpoint(d,w,x,y) why split this into two functions? why did x designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on? joseph sirosh

i have the task to program a x application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which i can draw something. unfortunately some basic books on the topic of x application programming are not available to me for the moment. i am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, vue and x11r4 using xt anbd xaw. what i did until now: i initialized the x intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with xtappinitialize. i passed as a application_class name 'commandwidgetclass'. then i set the argument values for window height and width using xtsetarg and passed it to the toplevel widget with xtsetvalues. when i call xtrealizewidget, i get a window of the specified size, but i have no idea how i can draw something in it. can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ? in which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ? thanks very much in advance soenke --------------------------------------------------------------------------------soenke voss faculty of economics soenke@wiwi12.uni-bielefeld.de university of bielefeld germany --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the only directory i know of that lists commercial and non-commercial widgets is the ics widget data book. ics sells the widgets for various prices. there are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. the ics widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. the nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews. i dont know there pricing schemes but it is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. this is the extent that i know about them except that i got their databook catalog and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there) i dont work for ics or have any widgets being sold by them. hope this helps you. -- brian dealy |301-572-8267| it not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov | | that's important,it's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy | | where it's not at... b.dylan -- brian dealy |301-572-8267| it not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov | | that's important,it's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy | | where it's not at... b.dylan

hi! i've just installed the new xarchie 2.0.1 and it all works fine, except: on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the program don't work at all, but on the bw terminal it works fine. i can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't give the neat-o change when busy action. (other programs with similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.) the x-interface author, george ferguson, suggests it might be a problem with the x intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around to fix it himself. but i know zero about x programming, so i don't think i can find it. does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem? andrew -- andrew jaffe ajaffe@oddjob.uchicago.edu dep't of astronomy and astrophysics, u. chicago 5640 s. ellis ave (312) 702-6041 chicago, il 60637-1433 (312) 702-8212 fax

evolution of sco newsgroups and mailing lists --------------------------------------------- many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on sco open desktop since 1990 through the ancestral usenet newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list. similarly, there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for sco products in general. with the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional sco newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating sco related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped may 1, 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within "biz". given the content, this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce" and "general" groups. on aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net" became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on june 1, 1992 to respectively accommodate sco xenix, unix and opendesktop specific binaries and source code. the binaries and sources news groups are moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. respecting usenet etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion area for the readers, writers and publishers of sco magazine. subject to the usenet news hierarchies carried by your upstream feed, you are now able to subscribe to the following: newsgroup mailing list subscription --------- ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca 	biz.sco.sources			<none> 	biz.sco.binaries		<none> 	biz.sco.magazine	 scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca you are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via usenet news mechanisms vrs mail. anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and i'll do my best to help. we also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous ftp and uucp, as do many archive sites. if, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists. the 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists, so anyone not having access to news but who does have a uucp or internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body: 	add: subscriber_address		-eg- 	add: your_logname@site.do.main -or- 	add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial. deletions are handled the same way, simply substitute "delete:" for "add:", ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with. mailing list subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission information when their request is processed. if you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host. in such cases, it's likely that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again. mailing list subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site. we loose a handful of subscribers this way each month. if this happens to you, please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. what's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past, present, and future implementations of the sco opendesktop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general: questions, answers and comments on sco products in general, and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce: sco and sco developer product announcements of 			interest to current and future users of sco products, 			and to sco developers, resellers and distributors. (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources:	sysv or bsd source code for useful programs and 			utilities, modified to compile and run with various 			incarnations of sco xenix, unix, and/or opendesktop. biz.sco.binaries:	binary packages compiled from sco compatible source 			code, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources 			and often installable using the sco "custom" utility. biz.sco.magazine:	interaction between the sco magazine readers, 			writers and publishers. you should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup. for example, posting your odt question to the "general" newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public odt archives. appropriate crossposting is allowed. the undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco namespace. suggestions for additional biz.sco.* newsgroups and/or mailing lists should be emailed to the address below. -- ed. a. hew, <edhew@xenitec.on.ca> ....!uunet.ca!xenitec!eah xenitec consulting services, kitchener on, canada +1 519 570 9848 trios training centres ltd. mississauga on canada +1 800-387-8649 [biz.sco.* newsgroups and mailing lists godfather]

we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. these programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. we typically have several of these running in windows, plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. xt and xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. o'reilly vol iv ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. we can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. the unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. we want that for the x main loop except not file i/o. any suggestions or examples most welcome! we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems. morris hirsch aka morris@sg25.nusc.navy.mil or 401 841 7800

i have been using a hds x-terminal, and really like it. what is really powerful is that it can run the x server without running a window manager. one can then run a special client x program called a window manager, either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no home). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc, or vms). this is powerful, especially since i can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (some of my vms tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). well the question is: on a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? basically i want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run the window manager. --- please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the large volumes in window.x) thanks. -- scott moody (206) 773-4313 "there are no answers .. just cross references" scott@shuksan.boeing.com uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott

i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 i determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. however, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. after some research, i believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by family, weight, slant, and pointsize. i believe that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it. since i have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path, the results are inaccurate. i do have some speedo fonts, but not for the family i am using (helvetica). i think this is incorrect. the fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display. this never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres! this is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts! for instance, the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a speedo font). the command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). despite the fact that x knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me! unless i my applications specifies a resolution, x appears to pick a stupid default. is this a bug? is it a feature? if so, why? is there anything i can do to get around this problem? people have suggested that i lie about my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both). this would at least make my app consistent, but i like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "yup, thats an inch". anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts i can use? system info: sun sparc 10/41 w/32 mb, sunos 4.1.3. xdpyinfo: version number: 11.0 vendor string: mit x consortium vendor release number: 5000 screen #0: dimensions: 1152x900 pixels (348x272 millimeters) resolution: 85x85 dots per inch xset q font path: /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/speedo/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/75dpi/ -- thanks- rbroders@oracle.com -bob brodersen (415)-506-2189 applications architect, applications technology group, applications division oracle corporation, redwood shores, ca 94065

i've installed many x apps, and have that many of them imakefiles that have lines startingwith xcomm in them. when i do a xmkmf to create the makefile, the makefile also has the xcomm (comment?) lines in them. i always have to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. i was wondering what these lines were for, and what i might be doing wrong that causes the make command to dislike them. thanks!
hi, i'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering to an x display and then playing it back again. rather than "reinvent the wheel", it like to find: 	* a file format for saving x protocol. 	* software that saves and replays such a session. any ideas out there? i've heard that there is a version of xscope that will save and replay sessions. i'd be willing to share much of the code i develop back to the x community. axel............ axel@cv.hp.com

dear netters: could you mail the source code of the book: "advanced x window application programming" by johnson and reichard to me? if you need any source code, just ask me. thank you very much! sincerely, zeng, qiyong. -- zeng,qiyong. suny at buffulo
given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, i would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable. all you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice. of course, this would be circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but i'd say if you're not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground with that approach... in fact, given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices, i'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being a lawyer, i can't be positive. regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and i would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible. even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing else. - brad -- brad daniels		`	| "if money can't buy happiness, daniels@neosoft.com		| i guess i'll have to rent it." i don't work for neosoft, and	|		- weird al yenkovic don't speak for my employer.	|

frequently-asked questions about the open look graphical user interface. if your question isn't here, please try (at *least*) 	man openwin 	man xnews 	man 7 xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the bibliography below before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists. special notes: * i have not updated this faq for the recently-announced openwindows 4, due to ship later this year. * yes, sun is moving to motif, along with all of cose. but the motif to which they move will be a new motif, with some of the open look ui features added. * yes, openwindows 4 will use dps instead of news. news is dead. this means tnt is dead, too. * xview and olit will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the next release. i don't know if there will be a source release of xview 3.1 or not. * the cose environment will include at least some of sun's deskset, ported to motif. look for calendar manager and mailtool, at least. * yes, the new mailtool will be mime-compliant. frequently asked questions for x11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly. this is version: $revision: 1.48 $; last posted version: 1.46 contents: (in rn and trn you can use control-g to go to the next topic) subject: terminology: open look, openwindows, x11, xview, (mo)olit, motif subject: window managers -- olwm, olvwm subject: openwindows, terminals, and other displays subject: configuration files: getting started with openwindows subject: key bindings, cut and paste subject: applications: finding out... subject: deskset, calendar manager, etc. subject: trouble shooting: strange error messages subject: trouble shooting: it won't let me type subject: trouble shooting: not authorized to use display subject: trouble shooting: other common problems subject: trouble shooting: xview problems subject: fonts subject: environment variables subject: where can i get it? ftp, implementations, etc... subject: bibliography -- books, manuals, journals, papers, beer-mats subject: getting this file, revision history, recent changes subject: terminology: open look, openwindows, x11, xview, olit, moolit, motif @ what is open look? open look is a specification of a graphical user interface (gui). a gui determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you edit files, etc. the open look gui is specified, developed and maintained jointly by sun microsystems and at&t (or usl?). see also: 	bibliography @ what is openwindows? openwindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the open look graphical user interface specifications. it's compatible with the x11 window system from mit as well as (currently) sun's news and sunview, so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. it comes from sun and also with system v release 4 from certain vendors. openwindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively. it should not be called `windows' or 'open look' or `openlook', as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. a commerical openwindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server, plus about $25,000 for deskset, and another $40,000 for tooltalk. the current versions of openwindows for various platforms are: 	sunos 4.1.1 on sun 3: 2.0 	solaris 1.x (sunos 4.1.x) on sparc: 3.0 	solaris 2.0 (sunos 5) on sparc: 3.0.1 see also: 	mixing x11 and openwindows 	where can i get it? @ what are olit, xview and tnt? these are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the open look specifications. see the bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits. here's a brief summary: olit was at&t's open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system; it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were already x11/xt programmers to learn. you could buy the source from at&t, although you didn't get the same version tht sun ship. sun includes the olit library in openwindows (q.v.); it is also often included in system v release 4. it was written in c. the release of olit in openwindows 3.0 was olit 3.0. olit support passed to usl (then a division of at&t, now owned by novell), who replaced it with moolit (q.v.). note that because of the nature of xt subclassing, you will probably want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 x technical conference] xview is sun's toolkit for x11, written in c. xview is similar in programmer interface to sunview. there's even a shell script to help migrate source code from sunview to xview.	 xview is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with x windows. the xview toolkit is included in openwindows, and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). the current version of xview from sun is 3.0. despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within sun -- the xview toolkit is *not* about to be dropped by sun. xview *will* be included in the next release of openwindows, unlike news. on the other hand, the xview toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from sun in the future as olit. the news toolkit (tnt) was an object-oriented programming system based on the postscript language and news. tnt implements many of the open look interface components required to build the user interface of an application. it's currently included in openwindows. the current version of tnt from sun is 3.1; release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tnt' 1.0 and tnt 2.0, but sun are committed to supporting the api, at least until they stop news support some time later this year and replace it with display postscript. wail. you might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit, however. the c++ user interface toolkit (uit) consists of an object-oriented c++ class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from devguide 3 gil files. the uit also includes features that simplify event management and the use of postscript and color. it is said to be compatible with openwindows v2 and v3, and presumably v3.0.1, since the release mentions that it works on solaris 2. uit is not an official sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within sun. it can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the mit contrib directory as uitv2.tar.z (use binary mode!). @ where does motif fit in? it doesn't :-). motif is an alternative graphical user interface that is being developed by osf.	it has a `look and feel' reminiscent of microsoft windows and the os/2 presentation manager. there are no non- commercial motif toolkits available, although the motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by osf.	although motif is currently available on more platforms than openwindows, the open look gui is almost certainly used on many more machines, simply because sun (and sysvr4) have such a large installed base. sun's cd/ware volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving motif applications by converting them to olit [:-)]; there are also notes in the `periodic table' olit demo, $openwinhome/demo/olittable. @ what is moolit? moolit is a version of olit from at&t/usl that lets users choose between a motif and an open look ui feel at run-time. it will be part of system v release 4.2. contact: joanne newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677 @ what about that display postscript thing? sun and adobe have agreed that sun will include the dps extension to x in the next release of openwindows. dps is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow level 2 postscript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously being harder to use, as i understand it. the only real advantage it has over news is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less complete; dps is also available on more kinds of machine. performance on our rs/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen. note that whereas x/news fonts are shared by both subsystems, the dps extension to x does _not_ make type 1 postscript fonts available to ordinary x11 programs. it is not like atm on a pc in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available, however) subject: window managers -- olwm, olvwm @ what are olwm and olvwm? they are window managers. a window manager is the part of the x window system (e.g. x11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. olwm is the standard open look window manager. it's included with all of the openwindows (q.v.) implementations, and you can also get the source by ftp, since sun donated it. olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name). it shows a little map on the screen, with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 you can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys. this lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other. olvwm was derived from the openwindows 3.0 olwm by scott oaks; you need to have xview 3.0 to compile it. get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm? yes. if you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use the pin and unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. if you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. for twm, put this in your $home/.twmrc: 	lefttitlebutton "target" = f.delete where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/x11/bitmaps. alternatively, try 	# add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm 	lefttitlebutton ":menu" = f.menu "ol.menu" 	menu "ol.menu" { 	 "quit" f.delete 	} for mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (i am told). see the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc). subject: openwindows, terminals, and other displays @ can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal? the openwindows xnews server combines sunview, news (postscript) and x11. this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. unfortunately, it means that some openwindows programs need either news or sunview support, and thus won't run on an x terminal. this includes pageview in particular. you can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an x terminal or a non-open- windows display, and most open look clients (e.g. olit or xview ones) will work perfectly well. you may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found. if so, see the fonts section below. if you are running the window manager built-in to an ncd terminal, you may have problems with input focus; setting *input: true in the terminal's xdefault file in /usr/lib/x11/xdm may or may not help. subject: configuration files: getting started with openwindows @ what configuration files do i need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc the first time you run openwindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($home). if it already exists, you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old x11 files you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files. if your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc, since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys these are optional files you can create in your $home directory, depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. look in $openwinhome/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change. you may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized. if you are not on an x terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -c, shelltool -c, xterm -c) or chuck musciano's "contool" program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .xdefaults you can put x windows resource specifications in here. in particular, it is a good idea to include at least: 	openwindows.focuslenience:	true 	*input: true these allow non-icccm-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .xdefaults. don't put comments in .xdefaults, since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps this is the news user profile file, read by openwindows (actually xnews) on startup.	 this is documented in the news programming manual, near the back. the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways.	the news manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. warning: things in this file rarely work on both openwindows 2 and 3. note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information. here's what $home/.startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for openwindows 3. you'll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your supersparc 10/51 gti injection :-) again, this is for openwindows 3... 	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of news toolkit reference manual 	% /includedemos? false def 	userprofile begin 	 /keyrepeatthresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def 	 /keyrepeattime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def 	 % note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... 	end you must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this: 	/news 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	/tntcore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	/tnt 3 0 findpackage beginpackage 	classrepeatkeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload 	endpackage endpackage endpackage if you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the openwindows server like this: 	$ psh -i .startup.ps 	welcome to x11/news version3 	$ psh -i 	welcome to x11/news version3 	/classinit classrepeatkeys send 	%%% now press control-d you can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make the root window be "retained", so that a postscript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows: 	frambuffer /retained true put will do this. note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the news server (xnews) dramatically. see also: 	trouble shooting: it won't let me type 	trouble shooting: is there an easy way to edit xdefaults? 	environment variables @ how can i configure open look for a left-handed mouse and keyboard? you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises. see also "man 7 xview" for a list of keybindings you can change, at least for xview programs. with openwindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let sunview handle them. the status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not; put this in your .xinitrc: if eval `svenv -env` then 	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3" 	input_from_defaults else 	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1" fi @ how can i get the screen to go blank when the system is idle? run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but effective screen saver. see `man screenblank'. under solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as it's not supplied. then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically. subject: key bindings, cut and paste @ how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs? to go from xterm to textedit (say): * select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button in xterm * press copy in the xterm (this key is l6, or meta+c (the o'reilly xview manual gets this wrong) * move to the textedit window, and press paste (l8 or meta+v) if this doesn't work, see trouble shooting: cut and paste to go the other way, from textedit to xterm: * select the text in textedit. no need to use copy * move to the xterm window and press adjust (the middle mouse button). * you can also use the copy/cut and paste buttons. @ copy/paste is boring.	 what short-cuts are available? quick copy within textedit, mailtool, etc: * click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * press and hold down the paste (or cut) button * select the text you want to copy/move. you'll see that it's underlined or crossed out, as appropriate. (in the jed demo it goes grey) * let go of the paste (or cut) button. * the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret. drag and drop to move a selection * select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple- clicking the select or adjust mouse button * put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * press and hold down down the select mouse button, and move the mouse pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon). * still holding select down, move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show that it's ok to drop things here * let go of select, and the text is moved.	this works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows. drag and drop to copy a selection * this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection, except that you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button. @ what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere? see the man page for textedit(1) for some of them. in general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g. ctrl+w deletes a word, and ctrl+w deletes the word to the right of the insert point. 	meta-i - include file	 meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) 	ctrl-a - start of line	 ctrl-< - back word 	ctrl-e - end of line	 ctrl-> - forward word 	ctrl-w - delete word	 ctrl-u - delete to start/end of line 	ctrl-return - move to end/start of document see the o'reilly xview reference manual for a list of some of the default keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page. @ what can i put in my .ttysrc?	 where is it documented? see the manual page for shelltool. subject: applications: finding out... contact sunsoft (or sun) and ask for the catalyst open look guide, which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_ catalyst listing of products for suns, updated six-monthly. sun's free cdware cd/roms each contain demo versions of several popular open look applications. often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full product documentation. sunpics produces a cd/rom for newsprint users, printer's pallate, which contains newsprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license. there is a separate faq posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a copy, including open look ui application list in the subject for a faster reply. subject: deskset, mailtool, calendar manager, etc. @ is there a tty-based interface to cm (calendar manager)? yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages. if "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under trouble shooting: strange error messages, below. @ how can i arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail? the best way is: $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer) add the follwing: 	key_right(3) filter 	cat ~/.signature (you might need to change ~ to $home) now pressing r3 will insert your .signature file. subject: fonts @ does openwindows support type 1 postscript fonts? yes, under either solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (i'm not sure which). or, not yet, in other words. if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them, i'm told. the 57 fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted, though, and comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is interesting... the f3 font format is described in a publication from the sun openfonts group, listed in the bibliography below. documentation on the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts. you can buy f3 fonts from sunpics, monotype, linotype, urw and probably other major foundries. sunpics' newsprint software supports type 1 fonts. @ improving font rendering time although the sun type renderer (typescaler) is pretty fast, it's not as fast as loading a bitmap :-). you can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters.	 if you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size. 	$ psh -i 	welcome to x11/news version3 <--- psh will say this at you 	currentfontmem =	% type this line ... 	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 kbytes 	1024 setfontmem 	% just to check: 	currentfontmem = 	1024 see pp. 328ff of the news 3.0 programmer's guide. you need to say psh -i so that the postscript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. @ making bitmap fonts for faster startup: 	$ mkdir $home/myfonts 	$ cd $home/myfonts 	$ makeafb -20 -m $openwinhome/lib/fonts/bembo.f3b 	creating bembo20.afb 	$ convertfont -b bembo20.afb 	bembo20.afb->./bembo20.fb 	chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. 	$ ls 	bembo20.afb	bembo20.fb	synonyms.list 	$ bldfamily 	* bembo		 ./bembo.ff (encoding: latin) 	cat: ./compat.list: no such file or directory 	$ xset +fp `pwd` 	$ xset fp rehash if you want the server to see your new font directory every time, add this directory to your fontpath environment variable in one of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile. @ converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.) you can also use folio fonts with an x11 server, by converting them to a bitmap (x11 bdf format) first. your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine, and unless you have newsprint you shouldn't use them for printing. having said all that... you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf. use mftobdf (from the seetex distribution) to convert tex pk fonts to x11 bdf format, which you can then use with either x11 or oenwindows. you can also use der mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running x display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /x/getbdf @ xview/olit fonts at 100 dpi there aren't any. more precisely, the various text fonts, such as lucida typewriter sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are scalable under openwindows.	 the glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't scale very well. subject: trouble shooting: strange error messages @ no manual entry for cm_lookup if man doesn't seem to find openwindows commands, even though you are running openwindows, try setting the manpath environment variable: 	manpath=$openwinhome/share/man:/usr/man;

subject: trouble shooting: not authorized to use display if you get error messages that look like 	xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server 	xlib: internal error during connection authorization check 	error: can't open display try, on the machine running openwindows or x11, 	xhost +machine where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed. if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you, using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking 	xhost +`hostname` (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation). this lets any user on `happyboy' access your display. with openwindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the programmer's guide describes how to do this in chapter 8, p. 101. this is more secure. also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly! also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows 3.0 under sunos 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem. it is available through your local sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist: fix patchid filename checksum loadmodule 1076118 100448-01.tar.z 04354 5 on an x terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display. if you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight, there might be a cron job that's removing the unix sockets in /tmp that are used to communicate with the server when $display doesn't have a hostname before the :, or is empty. have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets. subject: trouble shooting: other common problems @ i get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (sun 3 or 4) if "refresh" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later, 	you need to run "xterm -c" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in 	the background and then choose save workspace from the 	workspace->utilities menu. better still, pick up "contool" and run 	that. get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory. it 	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a 	message appears; it's very easy to configure. if "refresh" from the workspace->utilities menu doesn't make the messages, go away... 	a sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the 	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto 	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1". see the man. 	page for openwin; i have a shell script that checks for this and, 	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does 		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 	if you are running x11 or openwindows 2, you might need to add this 	to your .xinitrc or other startup file: 	( 	 eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` 	 olvwm -display unix:0.1 	) & 	later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. 	you can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages. also, see 	the note about contool, above. @ is there an easy way of editing .xdefaults? use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'. this starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your .xdefaults after removing comments. it then applies any changes. keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example, 	comment.*.font: palatino-italic-37 @ how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit? set the default editor to 	sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$file\"" (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one) @ how do i run openwindows in inverse video? this tends not to work under openwindows 2.	 with opwnwindows 3.0, there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options. if you're using openwindows 2 on a sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of upgrading the workstation to a sparc!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool. @ why don't flat check-boxes work? a known bug may make guide's output dump core if you use these. a workaround is to edit the guide output, as it's only guide's output that's broken, not the actual check-box code. this applies only to versions of devguide before devguide 3.0. if you're still using an ancient devguide, you should upgrade as soon as possible; the new one is fantastic! @ when i leave openwindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen. try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start openwindows (e.g. `openwin'). @ when i use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something. this was a bug related to some systems only. the only work-round was to use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc. @ why have some of my function keys stopped working? keys f11 and f12 changed from sunf36 and sunf37 to sunxk_f36 and sunxk_f37 respectively in openwindows 3. applications must be recompiled, or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again. @ when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, i get the sunview version see under "trouble shooting: strange error messages" below. (see also next item) @ mixing x11 and openwindows (see also next item) note that openwindows 3.0 includes the x11r4 core distribution (to patch level 18), but not the contrib directory. these notes apply to openwindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with openwindows 3.0 and x11r5. install the x11 libraries in /usr/lib/x11.	you can intermix openwindows and x11r4 or x11r5, they're all compatible in this respect. put the x11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/x11. put /usr/bin/x11 last in your path, so that you get openwindows versions of programs instead of x11 ones where appropriate, although this is a matter of preference. in any event, put the openwindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that. if you have /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on sunos) earlier in your path than $openwinhome/bin/xview, you'll get sunview programs instead of openwindows ones! set ld_library_path so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the x11 library directory.	this doesn't matter with openwindows 3.0, but with older versions you'll get error messages from x11 programs if you don't do this. the messages are generally harmless (see next item), although xdm core dumps if this isn't right. set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it isn't /usr/openwin. see also: 	environment variables (especially xfilesearchpath). @ i get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libx11.so.4 not found set ld_library_path to be /usr/openwin. if you also use x11, use 	 /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib if you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use ${openwinhome-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for /bin/sh; for csh it is different. @ i launch my filemgr and i get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero your system needs to be patched. look in $openwinhome/lib/ospatches and install the patch. @ why doesn't answerbook run for me? you must be running openwindows to use answerbook.	it won't run under x11 (on an x terminal or on anything else) because it uses news to draw the postscript text and pictures. if you are using openwindows 3.0, you need to use the openwindows 3.0 compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the answerbook cd/rom. if all answerbook users are using openwindows 3.0, you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia!) the navigator.ow3 binary is also on cd/ware vol 2. note that the data files are in postscript, so you can look at them with a postsript viewer (q.v.). @ why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb? a fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.z @ why is the properties choice disabled in the window menu? it isn't implemented yet. many programs do respond to the properties key (l3), though, or have a pop-up menu with properties on it. @ file completion in the c-shell is broken in cmdtool sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine. it also works if you run command tool on a remote machine. fixed in openwindows 3.0.1 shipped with solaris 2. @ when i run olit programs, some of the widgets are red! release 3 of olit added mouseless operation; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard. the currently selected item is highlighted in red (the `red stain') to show that it has the input focus. to disable it in most places, add this to your $home/.xdefaults file: 	*traversalon: off 	*textedit.traversalon: on 	*textfield.traversalon: on you can change the color using (for example) 	*inputfocuscolor: grey50 	*input*focuscolor: green 	*list*inputfocuscolor: <your background color> see the man page resources(3w), at the start of the olit 3 widget set reference manual included in the openwindows 3 programmer documentation. meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the olit/3.0 cte jumbo patch. @ when i run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when i move into a different window! ("colormap flashing") this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time. however, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure: * start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve. * run 	cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file * put the line 	cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc) * exit and then restart the window system. * cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of 	the colormap and reserves them. also note that control-l2 locks the colors of the current window, and control-l4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page. @ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above): this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif window manager (mwm) with openwindows. try running pageview like this: 	$openwinhome/bin/reservecolors -svmono 	$openwinhome/bin/pageview 	$openwinhome/bin/reservecolors -discard @ xdm breaks things command tool doesn't like being run without a unix `controlling terminal'. use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well. sunview applications may need to be run with svenv, as in 	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables. note that the mit xdm starts up the x server as root, which is a security hole for openwindows; use the openwindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start unix processes ass root... @ function keys 11 and 12 stopped working in openwindows 3.0, the x11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed to sunxk_f36 and sunxk_f37.	 code which uses them should be recompiled, or you might be able to get away with 	xmodmap -e 'keysym sunxk_f36 = sunf36' subject: trouble shooting: xview problems this section is here only until an xview faq appears, which has been promised, but hasn't reached here.	note that there is also a usenet newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month.	you should also look at the faq in comp.windows.x. @ how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items? panel_list_font takes an int row_number and an xv_opaque font_handle. panel_list_fonts take a null terminated list of xv_opaque font_handles. there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font. you have to make sure that you always specify panel_list_font when you insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits. @ how do i keep an xview pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed? in the button callback, do xv_set(button, panel_notify_status, xv_error, null); this will keep the window visible. you might also need to investigate the menu_notify_status attribute. @ how do i make an xview button look pressed?

[ people seriously interested in the whole area of system performance, might want to look at the o'reilly nutshell handbook "system performance tuning" by mike loukides. imho, it contains a well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance. i'm unaware of any other similar books. --ed.] ----------------- table of contents ----------------- 0. introduction & administrivia 1. what about the "other x faq"? 2. window managers 3. the x server which server? locking the server into ram? starting your server fonts about the resources file define your display properly 4. clients a better clock for x a better terminal emulator for x tuning your client 5. miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures a quicker mouse programming thoughts say what!? 6. other sources of information 7. author & notes ! = changed since last issue. * = new since last issue. ----------------------------- introduction & administrivia ----------------------------- this document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers. if you are reading a copy of this faq which is more than a few months old (see the "last-modified" date above) you should probably locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated. if you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can retrieve this faq from an archive site. there exist several usenet faq archive sites. to find out more about them and how to access them, please see the "introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers. the main faq archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27]. this document can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups. if you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body. ----------------------------- what about the "other x faq"? ----------------------------- david b. lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and well written "comp.windows.x frequently asked questions" document. its focus is on general x information, while this faq concentrates on performance. the comp.windows.x faq does address the issue of speed, but only with regards to the x server. the gist of that topic seems to be: 	"use x11r5, it is faster than r4". (please see the x faq for complete details). --------------- window managers --------------- there are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different features and abilities. the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features. at this point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate for a speedy window manager. a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger, is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move". also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) i've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun (1152x900 screen) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap. other font suggestions will be accepted. ------------ the x server ------------ which server? - - - - - - - make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware. if you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome x11 server. on my monochrome sun, i haven't noticed much difference between the xsun (colour) server and xsunmono, however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging. [ thanks to: jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk), michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ] how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a sun system, x should be compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled sun compiler. you can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not using the bundled sunos compiler. i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market. locking the server into ram? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged? eg: via a call to plock(). does this help performance at all? i've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone who's tried it. i am not in a position to give it a try. 			 [thanks to: eric c claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com), 				 danny backx (db@sunbim.be), 				 juan d. martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] starting your server - - - - - - - - - - - joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) : if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep for a second or two after launching each one. after i changed my .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time... we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though. this sounds crazy, but i have confirmed that it works! warner losh (imp@solbourne.com) provided me with a good explanation of why this works, which i have summarized here: when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections. a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts. this process touches a large number of pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu, and more importantly, memory. if you put a sleep in there, you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up. similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so forth. all this activity is typically memory intensive. once this initialization is done ("the process has reached a steady state"), the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages. by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation's limited resources this is most definitely a "your mileage may vary" situation, as there are so many variables to be considered: available ram, local swap space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients you are starting, etc. currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & i've experimented with: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) & i've even tried: 	(sleep 2; exec start_x_clients_script ) & and then in start_x_clients_script i had: 	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & [ the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched. ] all of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so i just stuck with my current setup, for its simplicity. you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. fonts - - - loading fonts takes time and ram. if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time. one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts. client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server. this will also conserve server resources, since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server. 			 [ farrell mckay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au), 			 joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) ] eg: my main xterm font is 7x13, so i also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it's menus and icons etc. twm's default font is 8x13. since i don't normally use 8x13, i've eliminated one font from my server. oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com): keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs. if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts, use a font server. about the resources file - - - - - - - - - - - - - keep your .xresources / .xdefaults file small. saves ram and saves on server startup time. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com) one suggestion: in your .xdefaults (.xresources) file, try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications. for example: *reversevideo: true then, separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files. for example: $home/lib/app-defaults. in your .login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath: 	setenv xuserfilesearchpath $home/lib/app-defaults/%n [ the "comp.windows.x frequently asked questions" faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work. --ed.] so, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from .../app-defaults/xterm. xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/xdvi, and so on and so forth. note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource-file naming pattern. you can check in your system app-defaults directory (often: /usr/x11r5/lib/x11/app-defaults/) to find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files with the same name. this is all documented in the xt specification (pg 125 & 666). 		 [thanks to: kevin samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com), 		 michael urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov), 		 and mike long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). 	 kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.] this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits: - easier to maintain / more usable. - fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource_manager property. as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources. - applications only process their own resources, never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. it also has drawbacks: - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up. this doesn't seem to make that much of a performance difference, and you might consider this a huge boon to usability. if you are modifying an application's resource database, you just need to re-run the application without having to "xrdb" again. - xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp. when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not. watch out for this!! i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file, which cpp stripped out. when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources. xt did *not* provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted processing the resource file. the loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef color'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management. - you may also run into some clients which break the rules. for example, neither emacs (18.58.3) nor xvt (1.0) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults. - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored, your client will not find its resources. loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) a possible compromise suggestion that i have (and am planning on trying) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my .xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for clients that i seldom use. define your display properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. in that situation, rather than setting your display environment variable to "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you should set your display variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0". by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests. 			[thanks to patrick j horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)] see the _display names_ section of the x(1) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name. "i don't think it's stock mit, but (at least) data general and hp have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the display isn't set specially." 			 rob sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.uu.net) [jody goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an xlib patch to change stock r5 to use local communication even if display is not properly set. i don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-mit patches and so have elected not to include it here. hopefully mit will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves. in the meantime, if you want to try it yourself, email jody. --ed.] ------- clients ------- if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running. think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running. for example: is there a smaller clock program than xclock? unfortunately, i haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. [ suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients (eg: xclock, xterm, xbiff) are welcome. --ed.] i've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject of x client programs. some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based, since xt, xaw and other toolkits are rather large. others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. in this case, using a non-xt (for example) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of ram consumed. the upshot of all this seems to be: don't mix toolkits. that is, try and use just athena clients, or just xview clients (or just motif clients, etc). if you use more than one, then you're dragging in more than one toolkit library. know your environment, and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment.

" this was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. you don't have to rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be xterm. in it's current version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. i've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature, but i've not found any yet. update (march 1993): i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt. he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. for instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster. also, while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements (we don't have any hard numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major. as an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets brought into memory. so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm. in summary? caveat emptor, your mileage may vary. if you can provide some hard data, i'd like to see it. specifically: how much ram each occupies, how much swap each needs, relative speed of each 2) mterm suggested by: der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /x/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

(this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.) - use a line width of 0 in gcs. on some servers this makes a huge difference. - compress and collapse multiple expose events. this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one. francois staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) : just a small remark: i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc, but i didn't find the time yet. i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster) [ any confirmation on this from anyone? --ed.] andre' beck (andre_beck@irs.inf.tu-dresden.de) : - unnecessary noexpose events. most people use xcopyarea/xcopyplane as fastest blit routines, but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the gc used for the blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit, that, in most cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it's event-loop again and again. - thousands of xchangegc requests. this "gfx context switching" is also seen in most handcoded x-apps, where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again. xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase). say what!? - - - - - - some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first: david b. lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) : how about this: swap displays with someone else. run all your programs on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display. goal: reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server. i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this, but i have received the following confirmation... michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se): i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this helps a lot on my poor little ss1+ with only 16 mb, it was essential when i only had 8 mb. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) : [the x11 server and the client are] competing for the same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine. not really a major problem, except that the x11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing. timothy h panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) : firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu's are mostly idle, x's cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. if they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action. the second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2 cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing even fewer context switches. ---------------------------- other sources of information ---------------------------- volume 8 in o'reilly's x window system series, ``x window system administrator's guide'' is a book all x administrator's should read. adrian nye (adrian@ora.com): a lot more tips on performance are in the paper "improving x application performance" by chris d. peterson and sharon chang, in issue 3 of the x resource. an earlier version of this paper appeared in the xhibition 1992 conference proceedings. this paper is absolutely essential reading for x programmers. -------------- author & notes -------------- this list is currently maintained by art mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list are gladly accepted. layout suggestions and comments (spelling mistak's too! :-) are also welcome. currently i have listed all contributors of the various comments and suggestions. if you do not want to be credited, please tell me. speedup-x-faq is copyright (c) 1993 by arthur e. mulder you may copy this document in whole or in part as long as you don't try to make money off it, or pretend that you wrote it. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- ...art mulder ( art@cs.ualberta.ca ) | "do not be conformed to this world, department of computing science | but be transformed by the renewal university of alberta, edmonton, canada | of your mind, ..." romans 12:2

im new to xlib programming. im having a problem i hope someone here can help me with. i create a window, and i want it to have some background color, say red, and draw an oval in it. further, when i resize the window, i want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) im using aixwindows on an rs6000. my problem is this: when i resize the window, only the "original" part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. everything else is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. i can see that it would be the right size if i could see all of it, but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. for example, i start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. if i resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. what am i doing wrong?? how can i get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? second question: could someone tell me what xaw and xmu are??? thanks, chris

well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0, the animation package i started just over 3 weeks ago. a number of the solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in the code, so have a look! the full blurb has been posted to comp.windows.x.announce. this post is in two parts. to unpack the source code, extract the articles into file1 and file2 (for example). use a text editor to remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers (including the markers themselves). next type "cat file1 file2 > file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.z | tar xvf -". read the readme file for instructions on how to proceed from there. enjoy! derek p.s. the source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/ directory. if there is enough demand, a static binary will be provided for those without the xview libraries or include files. ----------------------------------------------------------- | derek c. richardson | tel: (0223) 337548 x 37501 | | institute of astronomy | fax: (0223) 337523 | | cambridge, u.k. | | | cb3 0ha | e-mail: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk | ----------------------------------------------------------- ---cut here--- begin 644 xrastool1.0.tar.z m'yv0>.2$f4/gs1lv,5s > &@h<.'$"-*g$bqhl6+%4%ho%&c!@@ &d'$b''c m8\b1)4&&7*d1al8:,v[0b$&c)hp8(6w$f&$#),:?0(,*'4jtj-&c2),j7<jt m:=. pl>3+apr!,h6:0d.8*$bm.o17/6-*d1)5f1),^nw'ecqln8,6?.b"$c m)$<9-7r"w<nwk]^_@ ,+'oq"a0(0*d!

some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already, and can point me to some tools that would help. what they'd like to do is: given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either the data is arriving over a slow link, or the $display is across a slow link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture, and then repaint it in higher resolution. thus, the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each 4x4 square of pixels being filled in with a single color. next, each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version would be painted. since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be transmitted as a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all. instead, there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture as a small bitmap, and blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do). this brings up the question of whether the x server can help. that is, when a window is opened, is there a way to ask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels? or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process ("permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window? it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to expand. but if there is something that x itself can do to help, it's be nice to hear about it. (i looked in several fms, but if it's there, i obviously don't know the keywords ;-). if someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy. oh, yes; this is to run on some suns. part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as "if this were run across, say, a 4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear." then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for. -- if the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would now cost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times would explode, killing all its passengers.

(can preview in gray-scale or color on a color monitor.) - ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.

(of course, i'm biased...) desqview/x is a multitasker for dos computers, that uses a standard x11r4 server as it's display mechanism. dos applications and microsoft windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to x-protocol, allowing you to display them, or any r4 compatable x-program from any machine on the net to display to the pc's local display (or to any other display on the net). free tools are available for devloping x-applications for the dvx platform; many x-programs have been ported between dvx and unix with little or no modifications. (often, you only need to create a new makefile!) if you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com, and i'd be happy to fill you in. -- quarterdeck office systems - internet support - tom bortels pricing/ordering : info@qdeck.com | tech questions : support@qdeck.com bbs: (310) 314-3227 * fax: (310) 314-3217 * compuserve: go quarterdeck anonymous ftp: qdeck.com (149.17.8.10), leave your email address as password

(from experience). you would be much better off with an xterminal if this is a new install. the performance will be at least four times better. in addition it would be much easier to install and use. on top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4mb ram, ethernet card, very high performance graphics card, good monitor, server software, tcp/ip for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). i can get 15" tektronix xp11 terminals for under $900, and the performance is over 80000 xstones..... -- /--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | mark a. davis | lake taylor hospital | norfolk, va (804)-461-5001x431 | | sys.administrator| computer services | mark@taylor / mark@taylor.uucp | \--------------------------------------------------------------------------/

i've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of a piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget. i've managed to make it work in some ugly ways, but either a) x blocks on the tail and won't allow user input, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn't follow the expansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn't die after i've closed the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting for tail to die. 	i _know_ this code has to exist. anybody have it? a general popen() case would be perfered but at this point i'll take anything... thanks. -- greg knauss (greg@quotron.com) "llamas, dammit! llamas!"

hi people!: i'm looking for x servers for dos or windows. i've already seen desqview/x and xvision but i'd like to be aware of other choices. is there anything on the public domain or shareware ? and in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive pricing ? what about incompatibilities ? window managers ? any info is welcome. thanx in advance. c u! by(e) mario valente

i've written an application for sparcstation 2 gx+, under openwindows 3.0. the application uses xview stuff to create my window, and the sun xgl graphics library for rendering into the canvas. the application does real-time 2-d animation, but it does not update the the display fast enough. i'm using notify_set_itimer (xview call) to periodically kick off my update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. i want it to update 25 times / second. it's only doing about 11. also, it appears to be compute bound, because if i run anything else while my appplication is up, the update rate slows down even more. any ideas ? thanks.
i'm running hp-ux 8.07 with hp vue 2.01 and i need a hardcopy of the login window (the one asking for login and password) to include in a manual. i have tried: xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd from a login on a remote terminal, but it doesn't work. xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window server doesn't answer. any suggestions? i must use xwd because i don't have access to ftp and i can't obtain another program to grab the screen. thanks in advance nadia pitacco -- 	------------------------------------------------------- 	- nadia pitacco siap sistemi s.p.a. - 	- via g.b. grassi, 93 - 20157 milano italy - 	- e-mail: morgaine@siap.sublink.org -

how can i draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors and then erase it without having to redraw everything else? what's happening is this, if i draw it using gxcopy, it is drawn in the specified color. if i erase it using gxcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases whatever it overlayed. i then need to redraw all of the items it crossed. yuch. if i draw it using gxinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing resembling what i requested. it properly restores the color of underlying objects in erase mode. what's the solution? -- scott k. frost uucp: osu-cis!chemabs!scott.frost same mbox: bitnet: skf26@cas inet: scott.frost@cas.org personal: 2753 shrewsbury rd, upper arlington oh 43221

i am planning to convert my motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units which would all be set in the app's resource file instead of hard coded in the program. however, the word here is from people who tried this already that for some unknown reason xmform offsets placed in the resource file are still interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program. can somebody confirm this? thanks, joe pannon pannon@bcsfse.ca.boeing.com

hi folks, i'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a ss1+ running sunos 4.1.1 and ow 2.0, and i'm having a little trouble with make/imake. specifically, make bombs when it needs to use any xaw file. this isn't surprising since x11 files on suns with the standard ow 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/x11/xaw !!) actually, the real problem is that i know squat about imake, and i don't know how to tell imake where the x11 files are. i can see from the makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the makefile reads # makefile generated by imake - do not edit! help! is there some way i can edit the imakefile to tell it where to look? (i have set defines = -dopenwin_bug, as it said to in the readme file.) email and post are both fine. thanks in advance, dave

xm++/commoninteract another user interface development system ------------------- if you would like to implement x-toolkit applications with c++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class test : public xmwindow { 	void cmd(char*); 	void quit(void*); public: test() : xmwindow("xm++ test window") {} 	void initialize(); }; void test::initialize() { xmdropdownmenu* menu = createdropdownmenu(); menu->addlabel("&file"); menu->additems( entry("menu item &one", cb(test::cmd)), entry("menu item &two", cb(test::cmd)), nullentry); menu->addseparator(); menu->additem(	entry("e&xit", cb(test::quit))); addsubpane(edit, "myedit"); edit("myedit")->settext("hello world."); } void test::cmd(char* n) { 	edit("myedit")->settext(n); } void test::quit(void*) { 	exit(0); } void xmapp::initialize() { (new test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's readme): xm++ is a user interface framework for the c++ language built upon x11 and the x-toolkit. it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. xm++ was initially created for the motif widget set, now support for the athena widgets was added. applications created with xm++ run in both environments without changes, although many nice features are only available when using motif. in some situations xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a combobox borrowed from ms-windows), but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. xm++ has nothing common with motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate motif widgets in c++ objects and the '++' in it's name. many ideas for the xm++ architecture came from digitalk's smalltalk version, which provides an easy to use framework for windows/pm/mac applications (in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm++ dialogs :-). top level objects in xm++: * 'windows', 'systemdialogs' and 'toolboxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw * 'userdialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) controls (children of top level objects): 'statictext', 'staticimage', 'pushbutton', 'checkbox', 'radiobutton', 'edit', 'listbox', 'combobox', 'groupbox', 'panearea', 'drawing', 'toolbar' the staticimage and all the button classes can display b/w (x-bitmap format) or color (gif format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects xt callbacks to member functions of xm++ objects. commoninteract(ii) is built upon the xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system (research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices). if you are interrested, look into the june 1993 issue of the joop (sigs publications - journal of object oriented programming) - there should be our paper about commoninteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). commoninteract(ii) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. it currently supports only drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. known problem: the xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. about this first release: xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. so i think i can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. commoninteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. it's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: hp9000/720 running hp-ux 8.07 sun sparc running sunos release 4.1.1 pc-at386 running linux v0.99pl6 caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an at&t standard c++ compiler -

i am just beginning to try using the athena toolkit and am having some problems getting started. i think that some files are missing on the system, but there is the possibility that they are just in a different directory. when i try to link my program it can't find xtinitailize, xtrealizewidget, xtmainloop, xtcreatemanagedwidget, or commandwidgetclass. i've included intrinsic.h and command.h. i also had a problem on compile with xtncallback but replaced that with a null in order to compile and see if there were any other problems. i haven't used a toolkit before and this is simply an example i got from the manuel. can someone tell me where i might look for these calls, that is, in what file not what directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe in standard directories and generally does things his own way.

hello, i have a problem with x11r5 on a sun386i an i hope that someone can help me with it. i've built x from the mit sources after applying all patches i have got (i think 23). building was easy. after installing everything i started x but nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed to hang. i loged in from another machine an found the sun386i running well. 'ps' told me that there's a x-server and a xterm running. and with some experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^d i blindly hit the xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back. i guess it's a device problem but i did not find the correct device yet. i've got a sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ace-6 0688 94v-0, rev 53) sunos 4.0.2 and rom 4.4. please help me. i'm able to run clients on the sun and send the output to other machines but that's not what i did it for. thanks in advance, stefan

extract from the color readme file for anthony's icon library. for network discussion... color coordination... i tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. the problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``color needful applications'' such as : picture and graphic displayers, animation, real time video, raytracers, etc... . the following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use. icons, window managers, and general applications, should follow this table or something like it, unless the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors eg: values 0, 128 and 255. this results in 3 ^ 3 colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey eg: vales (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-d look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. this table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation. anthony thyssen - (sysprog @ griffith university) anthony@cit.gu.edu.au ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ a gods idea of amusement is a snakes & ladders game, with greased rungs. - terry pratchett "wyrd sisters" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking: i am attempting to add a working savescreen function to a new server. i have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through debugging i can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0, which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen. my problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even after i have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys. my question is: what am i likely to be missing that would cause this problem? i copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions: static bool next_savescreen(scr,on) screenptr scr; bool on; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */ if (on != screen_saver_on) { 		nextsetlasteventtime(); } if (on == screen_saver_on) { /* save user's current setting */ 		next_save_screen_brightness = nxscreenbrightness(my_eventhandle); 		nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* blank the screen */ } else {											 /* unblank the screen */ 		nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness); } return true; } i can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver, but i cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the screen. any tips/help would be appreciated. thanks. -- douglas scott (805)893-8352 center for computer music research and composition university of california, santa barbara internet: (nextmail ok) <doug@foxtrot.ccmrc.ucsb.edu>

hi, i'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events, so that when the program exits, i can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' file. i am adding an event handler for structurenotify to the toplevelshell: xtaddeventhandler(toplevel,structurenotifymask,false,configurecb,mydata); this works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). however, when i'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the xevent passed to the event handler callback. i'm accessing the xconfigure structure, like the x11 manual says. (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y). the width and height memebers are correct. when i reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings. q1: anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero? q2: any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? i've tried using xtgetvalues() on the toplevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all i get is garbage values for the x, y, width, height resources. thanks -- bob ross (ross@li.loral.com) | "mr. plow, that's the name. that name loral instrumentation, san diego, ca | again is mr. plow" - homer simpson

hi. i'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module, as xkeybind.o in a shared library, as libx11.so in suns openwindows. i tried to rtfm, but i didn't get any wiser that way. also, can i do the same on an rs6000 machine running 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). i know how to do it with real libraries (ar). i am trying to replace xlookupstring in the delivered libraries, with another that does a few special things. /per -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- per andersson - ppan@celsiustech.se (perand@stacken.kth.se on free time) managing networks ( and occasionally suns) at, but not speaking for: celsiustech ab, j{rf{lla, sweden

after looking at the scaling code i realized the follwing: 1) my problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation problem. 2) that the x server or font server will rescale the best font it can find to meet your requirements. this means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 you can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you. you should try to always use known pixel sizes. bill jones

due it seems to sun's crapulous organisation of the x libraries and includes, most standard (gnu and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar file). right now i'm trying to make ghostview. it complains it can't find x11/xaw/... so i just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/x11 and now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them. i still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way. has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a sun (sunos 4.1.3 and openwindows 3)? what's the trick i'm missing? i've even tried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it. ///peter
i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets: callbacks and actions the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window. i want to connect this to a widget. no problem so far. i could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards. but because the drawing takes some while, i want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events. then i want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted. it seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can i give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed ? has anybody an idea? please answer via e-mail. thanks in advance. soenke ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- soenke voss faculty of economics soenke@wiwi12.uni-bielefeld.de university of bielefeld w-4800 bielefeld 1 germany the only difference between me and a madman is that i am not mad !

it seems silly, but while i've located things like tgif that can edit gif files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, i haven't been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays a gif file in it. i've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail. is there one lurking about in some archive? nothing sophisticated; just "show the pretty picture"? alternatively, if i could locate the specs for gif, i don't suppose it would be too hard to write it myself, but i have no idea where to even start looking for the spec.

thanks to bruce barnett, who recommended xvttool, and bernward averwald and liam quin, who recommended modifying .xdefaults to get the desired behavior for a *class* of xterms. in xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like: "a"	"a" "b"	"b" "c"	"c" ... and specify said key file on the command line. this will translate any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case). works great, and you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side. to use an xterm solution, add to your .xdefaults: capxterm*vt100.translations: #override \ <key>a: string("a")\n\ ... or: capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\ <key>a: insert-string(a) \n\ <key>b: insert-string(b) \n\ ... and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm thanks loads! -- kevin weinrich computer sciences corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov

hi, netters: we have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. for example, makedepend chokes on one of x11 include files (as distributed by sun) - namely xos.h: #if !defined(sunos41) || defined(__stdc__) # include <string.h> # define index strchr # define rindex strrchr #else /* bsd && !__stdc__ */ # include <strings.h> #endif /* !sunos41 || __stdc__ */ here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under solaris2. we also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. we got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. in all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (sun's distribution) mentions this problem: bugs if you do not have the source for cpp, the berkeley c preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to "true" regardless of their actual value. this may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated. makedepend should simply have its own parser written for #if expressions. has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us? since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> i'll post a summary. thanks in advance. *************************************************************************** * michael turok * * * information resources, inc. * e-mail: mlt@blues.infores.com * * 200 fifth avenue * voice: (617) 890 1100 ext.7531 * * waltham, ma 02154, usa * fax: (617) 890 4660 * ***************************************************************************

hi all, i've read the faq, i've fiddled around, but i am still having problems getting my poor old hp9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127. i have the following in my .xdefaults: xterm*font : -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 so i believe that i have the correct font selected to use in xterm. i have not set my lc_ctype environment variable because whatever i put it, it tells me that that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined, or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist). i can get some of the characters above 127 to print out, but they are not where i'd expect them -- for example, alt-v does not produce a u umlaut. this leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings, which are as follows: speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef> intr = ^c; quit = ^\; erase = ^h; kill = ^k; swtch = ^@ eof = ^d; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^s; start = ^q -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop anyway, i've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated. 					thanks! 					brendan

hi, i am running x11r4 on an ibm rs/6000 (aix 3.2) and x11r5 on a sun4 (sunos 4.1). since i run x on both colour and black&white displays, i need different values for the same resource, so i want to use #ifdef color in my application defaults files. however, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and not when the resources are loaded on demand. is there a proper solution to this? so far, the only proper solution i've come to think of, is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say xterm and xterm-color, and set my xfilesearchpath to either $home/%t/%n or $home/%t/%n-color. but that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set xfilesearchpath). furthermore, i thought of using #include "xterm" in xterm-color. however, for resources in xterm that i want to override in xterm-color, things are different on both machines. on a sun, the first found resource is used (i.e. the one from xterm, the b&w one), while on an rs/6000, the last found value is used (i.e. the one from xterm-color). what can i do about it? i have one last question: for the specification of xfilesearchpath, i can use %t, %n, %c and %s. %t stands for app-defaults, %n for the resource class, but what do %c and %s stand for? thanks in advance for replying, marcel. -- x drs. marcel wijkstra (aio visualization) wijkstra@fwi.uva.nl |x| faculty of mathematics and computer science ph: +31 20 525 7522 x university of amsterdam the netherlands fx: +31 20 525 7490 =========== life stinks. fortunately, i've got a cold.==================

hi, i've tried to get rid off xdm's ugly login window by giving it a 'cool' backgroundpixmap ressource. as login is derived from core, this should be possible. anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundpixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not produce any message of the form 'cannot convert string to pixmap' and explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too. any way to do it ? -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o | \\\- brain inside -/// | o | | o | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | o | | o | andre' beck (abpsoft) mehl: andre_beck@irs.inf.tu-dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

bristol technology announces the availability of its hyperhelp(tm) and xprinter(tm) demo for downloading. this demo showcases the two products in the form of a diagram editor called de. download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself: 	 o complete on-line context sensitive help system. 	 o printing support for pcl5 and postscript. 	 o rotated text support! 	 o source code for the demo is provided. the demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9). there are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/bristol directory: sun - sun4.demo.tar.z (sunos 4.x) hp - hp700.tar.z (hp-ux 8 & 9) if you have any questions about the demo, send an e-mail to: support@bristol.com. if you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com. remember to use binary mode! what are hyperhelp and xprinter? read on...... --------------------------------------------------------- bristol technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of its popular hyperhelp product and version 2.0 of xprinter. 			 hyperhelp 3.0 			 ------------- hyperhelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context sensitive help in the unix marketplace. through a one line function call, application developers can access the full features of hyperhelp and cut down drastically on their development time. hyperhelp can use the same rtf, project, and bitmap files as the ms windows help facility. this allows a documentation department to maintain a single set of help documents portable between ms windows, motif and open look. hyperhelp can also be authored in framemaker. and with hyperhelp 3.0 bristol introduces its sgml compiler! new features in hyperhelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character based viewer, segmented bitmaps, sgml support, and an improved history window. 			 xprinter 2.0 			 ------------ xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated printer support to their existing/new x based applications very easily. xprinter uses the xlib api for both the display and printer. this lets you use the exact same code for drawing and printing. take a look at the source code for our demo and see xprinter in action. if you are interested in adding postscript and pcl5 support to your application, xprinter is the tool for you! earlier this year bristola dn usl signed an agreement that resulted in xprinter becoming the standard printing technology for unix svr4.2. feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about hyperhelp and xprinter. if you have any questions or comments, send them to us at: info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969. 				happy demoing, 					the staff at bristol technology

i am working for a company which has only one connection to the internet. this is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). i would like to be able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the display to my pc which is running an x-terminal emulator (exceed/w). the display can be set to the gateway workstation with no problem but when i set the variable to my ip address i get a "error: can't open display" message. this can't be that hard to work around can it? btw i have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company) and having them display on my pc. -- curtis wahlgren
any tcpview-for-sun users out there? i pulled down the pre-compiled executables made for sun for tcpview, but i'm getting a whole slew of the following types of error messages when i try to start it up: warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfactivate warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfactivate:managerparentactivate()' warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfcancel warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfcancel:managerparentcancel()' warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfselect warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfselect:managergadgetselect()' ... but i *know* i have those in my keysym: egrep "osfactivate|osfcancel|osfselect" $openwinhome/lib/xkeysymdb yields: osfactivate :1004ff44 osfselect :1004ff60 osfcancel :1004ff69 osfselectall :1004ff71 and, if i take *out* the osf lines from said xkeysymdb, my copy of wscrawl (another motif-compiled-for-sun program) gives the same type of complaints as listed above. any tips? i'm mystified. -- kevin weinrich computer sciences corp. kbw@helios.ath.epa.gov
hello, i was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), i assume it would be called xod. actually, any viewer for a core file will do. i looked at export ( @ mit ) in the index of /contrib, but didn't find anything relevant. 			thanks, 			i hate bama & winter 			main@superman.msfc.nasa.gov
