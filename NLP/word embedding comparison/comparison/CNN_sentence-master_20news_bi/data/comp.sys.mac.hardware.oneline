(quicktime movies, perhaps?) as long as the region isn't being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure. i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware, and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port. what other patents does apple have on the mac? -- joe schwartz e-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu or xor@clotho.acm.rpi.edu mapinfo corp. 200 broadway these are my own opinions. any similarity to the troy, ny 12180 opinions of mapinfo corporation is purely coincidental.
my wife has one of these. i have not had much chance to fiddle with it, but in comparison to our laserwriters with canon engines, she complains that the print is too light for her taste. the difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the select 310 is adjusted to the darkest possible level. i don't find it objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably different. i recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black vs. write-white engines when dealing with tex drivers. is something like that going on here?

approximately four months ago, i purchased a quantum 240lps hd from la cie for $649. after two months, the drive started having problems. first, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one. well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. often, when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark. sometimes, if i then insert the silverlining (5.42) program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd. i've called la cie again and they've given me another rma. their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem. given that this is the second bad drive in four months, i asked la cie to send me a *new* one, but they said "no." also, within three weeks after i purchased my original drive, la cie dropped the price on it by over $100. i can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_i think the data is still in good shape and i'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.) it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. i feel a little helpless about all this. i don't mean to necessarily flame la cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. but c'mon. sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (i sent a letter to la cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product. they didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.) what's the moral of this story? i'm not sure. but i do know i won't buy any other products from la cie in the future. bill krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu ps please don't email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been. i'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that. all i'm saying is that i've had a disappointing experience with them and i'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

i have been playing with my centris 610 for almost a week now. i must say this machine is really fast! the hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but i got powerkey from sophisicated circuits and it works like a charm. however, i still have a few complaints: - when i restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop pattern) jerks up and down for a few times. - the quantum 170 drive is noisy overall, i highly recommend it: it is fast, affordable and looks great! -- dominic cheng (d2cheng@descartes.uwaterloo.ca) computer science, university of waterloo, ontario, canada

does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to apple's specs that forces the external output on lc's and the powerbook's 160/180 and duo 230 into a true vga style output signal? the nec adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the macs output into vga mode. do i have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up?? the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter. i'm assuming that the powerbooks/duos will work with the same adapter(?); macintosh lc to vga the macintosh lc can supply a 640 x 480, vga timed signal for use with vga monitors by using an adapter cable. the standard macintosh lc supports vga to 16 colors, and with the optional 512k vram simm, the vga monitor is supported to 256 colors. note: the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level inputs. however, some low impedance input vga monitors do not work with the macintosh lc. to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor. following is the pinout description for the adapter cable: macintosh lc vga video connector pin signal name --------------- ---- ----------- 1 6 red ground 2 1 red video signal 5 2 green video signal 6 7 green ground 9 3 blue video signal 13 8 blue ground 15 13 /hsync 12 14 /vsync 14 10 hsync ground 7,10 nc sense1 & sense2 tied together vga monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the macintosh lc video connector. the macintosh lc grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor id for a vga monitor. *************************************************************************** this message was created on mcw bbs a jointly supported by new orleans mac user group & national home & school user group user@maccomw.uucp the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only. ***************************************************************************

i have a radius precision color 24x video card for the mac that fits in a nubus slot. the card has 3 mb of vram on it, which means that 24-bit color is possible on the card! the card supports just about any monitor scan rate you can think of (i used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it can go higher). you can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a software control panel. this is the accelerated version of the card, which means all quickdraw calls are not executed by the cpu but taken over by the video card, freeing up the mac processor for other tasks. the cheapest i could find this card for when i called around last night was $1738 at mac's place. i will sell it for $1250 + shipping. it is just over a year old and never been any problem. it comes with software and the original manuals. hurry! chris magnuson chrism@col.hp.com hewlett-packard company (719) 590-2963

i've got the official word on the laserwriter pro 600 memory upgrade. i just got off of the phone with the quite friendly donna rossi at apple customer assistance. she tells me that those who purchased the laserwriter pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade. for those who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi or greyscale (at 300dpi). if the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their hardware support numbers and/or apple customer assistance 1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number). regards, glenn p.s. - personally, i'm annoyed at our school bookstore. they really have an obligation to provide this information to all of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for things like a phone number). when i get my upgrade completed, i'm going to write apple and complain.

	well, i just got my centris 610 yesterday. it took just over two weeks from placing the order. the dealer (rutgers computer store) appologized because apple made a substitution on my order. i ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. he wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!! they must be backlogged on centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with! 	anyway, i'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions. being nosy, i decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time. the scsi cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping). no big deal, but i would have been pissed if i tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up! 	the hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine. i've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so i might try to get it swapped. 	i am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off. this wasn't mentioned in any of the literature i saw. also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful. having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient. 	oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. i've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature... 	anyway, above all, it's fast. a great machine at a great price! gnelson@physics.rutgers.edu

i'm interested in getting an external hard drive for my se/30. i've got an internal 40mb that's pretty full, even with compression s/w. alot of people talk about $/mb, what's a good ratio? i'm thinking of adding either an 80 or a 100 (or 105). what brands would people suggest? finally, places to buy from? are more popular mail-order places better to order from or the places that just sell hard drives (e.g. ones that advertise in the back of macworld and macuser). thanks in advance. if e-mail replies are sent, i'll compile them and post them. -- drew -- ========================================================================== | drew j. asson | space telescope science institute | | ai senior software engineer | 3700 san martin drive | | advance planning systems branch | baltimore, md 21218, usa | | internet: asson@stsci.edu | (410) 338-4474 [338-1592 (fax)] | ==========================================================================

well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) i had a "bad" experience with techworks. this past summer i upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci. when i called to place the order for the pb ram, i was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if i would return the original ram (which was also techworks ram.) i followed the instructions for returning the old ram, expecting to see a credit on my visa within a few weeks. well, months went by, and no credit. after many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) i finally found someone who told me "why we never received your old chips." i then explained i the procedure that i had followed to return them, to which the person replied "you mean you sent them us mail?" (which i had, per the original sales person's instructions.) i was told that they their loss of us mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that i should have sent the stuff via fedex, etc. i reasoned that i had done exactly what i had been told to, but they would not budge, the people i spoke with were absolutely no help. i sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the us mail, made *many* more phone calls to techworks, all to no avail (i wouldn't give-up because i was so disgusted.) sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing i could do to pursuade them to "make it right." i finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem. three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement. i have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that i received from a company. in all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but i went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened. oh well, c'est la vie. i will never buy another product from them again. (there - had to get that off my chest!)

i'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a vga monitor (an ibm 8513 sold w/ many ps/2's to be exact) on the mac lc iii. all of the vendors i have called say that the internal video will not work on a true vga monitor but will work on a ibm compatible multisync like the sony's or the nec monitors. i thought the vga capability of lciii was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive vga monitors. am i confused or are these vendors just not up to speed? has anyone used an lciii with a non multisync vga monitor and if so where did you get your adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)? i would prefer to get a apple monitor for these lciii's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an ibm bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more lciii's we can afford and the more ps/2's we can get rid of! charles kuehmann northwestern university steel research group qman@casbah.acns.nwu.edu

has anyone had any problems with their duo dock not ejecting the duo properly? when i first got it, the duo would come out of the dock a couple of inches when ejected, and i had to pull it the rest of the way. nowadays (and i've had the system for 4 months), the duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and i have to grab hold of it and pull it out myself. is there a simple fix for this, or do i have to return it to my apple dealer, where it will languish for weeks while i have to make do with no colour display, no vram, no floppy or scsi etc. (btw, it's not that the duo is locked into the dock - it just doesn't want to slide out any more). -- phil jimmieson, *********************************************** computer science dept., * janet : phil@uk.ac.liv.csc * liverpool university, * internet : phil@csc.liv.ac.uk * po box 147 *********************************************** liverpool l69 3bx "i was head over heels in love until i got cramp" (uk) 051-794-3689
i recently aquired a quantum q250 harddisk. it is a 50 meg 5.25" mechanism. it is scsi. i have a few questions and a few problems. first there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that i can't figure out what it is for. the address is set by some jumpers on the bottom so i don't think it is for that. any ideas? second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. there are a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for. third, i have got the drive to format. it took a while to get things to work and most of it is fine for now. the formating initialy was troublesome but seems to be ok. the main problem is if you do a reset on the macplus the drive disappears. if i shut the mac off and then back on agian then the drive comes up fine. any ideas. please reply to one of the email addresses below. thanks richard crispin department of psychology email:rcrispin@watarts.uwaterloo.ca university of waterloo psych@watserv1.uwaterloo.ca waterloo, ontario phone:(519)888-4781 or 885-1211 ext. 4781 canada n2l 3g1 fax:(519)746-8631

hi! i'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my mac has two serial ports, i have appletalk, a modem, a printer, midi, and a sound digitizer. (2 != 5, unfortunately.) specifically, i'm looking at the axion electronic switcher, because it seems to be fairly cheap. (about $128 at maczone.) does anyone know anything about it? i've heard that with most of these things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you from physically swapping cables. although i've also heard that programs that use the comm toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they want; does anyone know if this is true with the axion switchbox? finally, if the axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you think is good, i'd be interested in hearing about other products. i would like to spend under $140, if possible. please reply through mail; i'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup. if there's interest, i can post a summary of replies. thanks a lot! m. scott smith (umsmith@mcs.drexel.edu)

i want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers. (around 5 mb.) i have a quadra 950. i have a nubus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 mb/s. (using block-mode transfers) i have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous pb calls) that can achieve 6.8 mb/s. let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card. it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card. (6.8 mb/s then 8.5 mb/s result in an overall 3.8 mb/s. too slow!) so i tried the following scheme: for an n-megabyte transfer, step 1: load the 1st mb from disk to buffer. step 2: asynch send 1st mb out card, load the 2nd mb from disk to buffer. step 3: asynch send 2nd mb out card, load the 3rd mb from disk to buffer. ... step n: asynch send the n-1 mb out card, load the nth mb from disk to buffer. step n+1: send the nth mb out card. even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the mac cpu at all, (it is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another. so there is no improvement in the rate. why? is the mac ram dual-port? (so the nubus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac ram? is there anything i can do? --david +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ | david blume | "i get tired thinking of all the things i | | dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com | don't want to do." --bukowski, _barfly_ | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face: "why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own?" here's why- people have hounded apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor in it. apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. how does one get around that without designing a new chipset? use existing powerbook technology to your best advantage. the duo dock gives apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a "semi-portable" fashion. by plunking the 040 into the dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk. on the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. okay, not the best solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) so, does this mean one will be able to use the powerbook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor? okay, we're getting really hypothetical now... -- travis grundke		 | macgames digest- your #1 source for information, contributing editor,	 | news & reviews of gaming software and the gaming macgames digest	 	 | industry in the macintosh community. reply an780@cleveland.freenet.edu | for more information on macgames digest.
1. why, or how actually, can a powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the 72 dpi resolution? (i assume that it doesn't, and i don't mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions) 2. any info on price drops or new models (non-duo) coming up? thanks, jt

here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped myself and a few others: what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set (through control panel) in your simms? ex: i have a mac iici with 20 meg ram, an external video card (so i don't rob my simm's), and the default apple cache card (i believe this is 32k?). say i have my cache set at 2 meg, what good does a measly 32k do me on the cache card? could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the simm's? or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the simm ram cache? i'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself. yet, daystar fastcache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations. are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm accesses? please help, i'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici system described in the ex above. --patrick hurh@fnal.fnal.gov
hello all. 	i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me. 	i am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600). i read an old report on a card from lapis that could do this, but could not use the external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw- back. has this perhaps been fixed? or can any other cards do this (like the micron xceed) ? 	also which monitor should i buy? at the moment i am leaning towards the sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?) but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about? doesn't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions? please send me e-mail and i'll summarize. i would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards. thanks in advance eggert thorlacius university of iceland

hi, i have been getting a lot of requests for this information so i thought i would post it for those interested parties. (sorry for length). to increase the maciisi speed to 25mhz or 33mhz the clock must be changed from 40mhz to 50mhz or 64mhz respectively. this is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. 	1. open up the si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. 	2. remove the hard disk by disconnecting the power and scsi cables, 		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. 	3. remove the flopy drive. 	4. remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting 		the supply straight up and out. 	5. remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom 		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out. 	6. remove the mother board by spreading the tabs on the left and 		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then 		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the 		board must be removed first) 	7. desolder the 40mhz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). 		this is not easy even for a skilled solderer. 	8. get an ic socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins 		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. 	9. put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 		them in. 	10.insert a 50mhz or 64mhz clock. 	11.put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and 		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. i made a 		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole 		in the board between the two chips. mount the screw using 		insulated washers. screw a cross member down over the heat 		sync's to hold them in place. don't use too much pressure. 	12. put it all back together and go-for-it. disclaimer: this is only the procedure i used and is not authorized by anyone. 	 you are on your own for this procedure. i'm quite sure it will 	 void your warentee. bye for now, ************************************************ ralph durtschi (208) 236-3256 idaho state university email: durtralp@ux1.isu.edu ************************************************

does anyone work with the a/rose card? we have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system, and lets crash the mac then. okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate errors in the 68000. before every instruction some specified registers are masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits. normally, the "crash instance" of a/rose notices a crash, sets a flag and stops working. by reading the mentioned flag the mac can notice a card crash. that works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system. the documentation of a/rose does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy. so, can anyone help? please only reply via email, as i don't read this group. -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- _ department of computer science iv / \ |\/| university of dortmund, germany \_/laf | |aennig e-mail: maennig@veronica.informatik.uni-dortmund.de --------------------------------------------------------------------------- "in the beginning god created adam ... ahem! ... atoms. atoms of hydrogen." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

i have a chance to buy a used ps/2 appletalk card to create a network with my home machines. however, the guy who has the card tells me there's a db-9 or db-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that i expect. this sounds more like a thicknet ethernet card. should there be a transciever on it, like on the quadras? what would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of these cards, keeping in mind that it's micro-channel architecture, which means take your best guess and double it. email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com thanks.

in the macuser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned that the c650 and the q800, and not the c610, had rom accelerated video. it didn't seem to make much difference in their "benchmark" test. what is it? i don't recall seeing it in dale adams post. -erik speckman p.s. could someone tell me if dale's posts on video and memory are archived somewhere.

excuse me if this is a frequent question, i checked in several faqs but couldn't really find anything. i have a iisi with the standard 5 meg memory and i want (need) to add additional memory. but i'm on a budget. i really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is the best (performance wise) and most economical way to do this? someone told me that i should only use simms of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg, 4 2 meg, etc. what if i just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg and use the rest of what i already have? the manual hasn't been very helpful with this. thanks.

okay, i don't use it very much, but i would like for it to keep working correctly, at least as long as apple continues to make system software that will run on it, if slowly :-) here is the problem: when the screen is tilted too far back, vertical lines appear on the screen. they are every 10 pixels or so, and seem to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus. it looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection between the screen and the rest of the computer. i am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer, or taking this one to the shop. i would also like to not have to buy one of larry pina's books. i like larry, but i'm not sure i feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual for it. on a related note: what does the monitor connector connect to? erik
i would like to know if a performa plus monitor is compatible with apple 14in color display, or it is just a vga moniro. any help will be appreciate.
here's a good one: does anyone know of a product that allows me to rack mount my 2ci (or maybe 650 if i blow some more money...) ??? my application is music, and would like to be able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an mo drive or something so i don't have to depend on an internal fixed hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal hd...) i'm in the san francisco bay area, if that matters. also, anyone have any info on 650's and midi? and, would anyone care to email me with the price they paid for their 650? or if there's a price list faq, never mind... just curious about the difference between the best retailers and the local university pricing... thanks, jeff adams adams@upse01.mtv.gtegsc.com

(2) on the mac side, you will need: - one thinwire media adapter (from apple or third-party). - macx (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on system 7.1). - mactcp (which comes with macx; if you get macx v1.2, you should be getting mactcp v1.1.1 with it. don't use earlier versions on a centris). - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the thinwire media adapter. so just ask the sales if the adapter is self-terminated or not. - configure mactcp to use "ethernet". (3) on the decstation side, you will need: - for a model 200, you will only need a t-connector. - for models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an aui-to-bnc adapter. get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the decstation. this way you save the cost of a transciever cable (a 15-pin aui male to a 15-pin aui female cable). - get a 25ohm terminator. your two-machine network will look like this: ##t----------------------------------------------[] +-----+ | | | | +-----+ +-----+ | | +-----+ decstation centris 5000/200 650 or ##t----------------------------------------------[] {=} | +-----+ | | | +-----+ +-----+ | | +-----+ decstation centris 5000/25,125,133,240 650 ## -> 25ohm terminator t -> t connector --- -> thinwire (rg58 coaxial cable) {=} -> aui-to-bnc (i.e. thick-to-thin) adapter [] -> thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated) | | andy -- andy sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca) 4 taddle creek road, toronto computing coordinator ontario, canada. m5s 1a4 department of industrial engineering phone: (416) 978-8830 university of toronto fax: (416) 978-3453

i have an old mac plus. a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc. it came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much). well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires. there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. i know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>. if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct. btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). oh, well . . . ***************************************************************** * tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath, * * from the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death, * * from the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud, * * o, why should the spirit of mortal be proud? * * -william knox * ***************************************************************** * shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu * *****************************************************************

i just recently bought a 4 mb ram card for my original mac portable (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. it happens when i put the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset switch. other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error message of "co processor not installed". i know one solution is not to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix it? the memory card is psuedostatic ram and goes into the pds slot. that probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is king memory (not kingston) from irvine, ca. they say the problem is in my machine. any ideas? -- gene wright. -- gene@jackatak.raider.net (gene wright) ------------jackatak.raider.net (615) 377-5980 ------------

yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the fact that the lciii uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to each simm. in the case of the lc iii, it only has one simm slot, but accesses will be 32 bits wides. *************************************************************************** the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.

i haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac. we would like to try it, and i wonder if someone had some good advice. we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum 40mb hard disk, and an unusable floppy drive. we also have a new spare connor 40mb disk which we would like to use. the idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some problems: the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive. if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work? is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk? what about terminators? i suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them installed in the other disk. the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets id #1. the old one should have id #0. it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk. thank you! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- torbj|rn rognes email: rogntorb@idt.unit.no

i own a mac iisi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc). can you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the pds slot and 2) the hard drive power feed. secondly, can you tell me if there is a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit for both combined? felix lin, a new reader of comp.sys.mac.hardware feilimau@leland.stanford.edu

the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week, and i'd like to hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened. it is an lc, with 10mb of ram and an 80mb internal drive, running system 7.1, with a few scsi devices in a (so far as i know) properly terminated chain. i had shut down the system for a day-- i was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking question mark. i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed okay, but there was no sign of the internal. i installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot from it. i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining, to inquire about the internal drive. they either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it. (silverlining claimed it was a connor drive, but it is a quantum... ) well, i'd backed things up, so i was able to work. but, at some point i noticed that the internal had reappeared. now, disk first aid says that all's well, etc. things seem to be fine. but, what happened? was this a warning that something (the internal hd or something else) is about to die? i'm definitely nervous. and, if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick, is it true that i can only put up to a 127mb drive inside an lc? some folks have claimed there's a limitation in the lc (other'n size or power) while others (and that includes lacie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay. thanks for answers.
could someone please do one of the following: 1. point to an init that allows me to turn off power management on my duo 210. 1. write an init that would allow me to turn off all power management on duo 210. 2. point me to documentation on power management so that i can write such an init. 3. explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible. ideally, of course, i would like to be able to turn in on and off on the fly. surely such an init would be very helpful to powerbook owners who want to do midi... i cannot imagine why it is not possible to do, unless it requires apple to divluge some secret. and if that is the case, the surely apple could write the init.

i had the same question for my 55lb nec 5fg monitor. the apple guy said that their 50lb 16" monitor is ok to put ontop of the centris and had no coment beyond that. i was going to just put the nec on the box but then i got to thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with apple's (i don't know the area of the base of their tilt/swivel). additionally, the cdrom drive is in the middle. so i cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the centris's top and the monitor!! mick mueck mick.mueck@analog.com **************** i hate *chipsoft's* macintax *******************

i have an old mac plus. a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc. it came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you very much). well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell me the order of the wires. there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. i know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>. if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct. btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). oh, well . . . one more thing: in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order. omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input. ***************************************************************** * tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath, * * from the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death, * * from the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud, * * o, why should the spirit of mortal be proud? * * -william knox * ***************************************************************** * shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu * *****************************************************************
i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks. the plan i have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch. this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower (stock) speeds it i experience any compatability problems with any applications. i don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if i can switch without any lock-up problems, then i could switch to 33mhz when needed and put it back to idle (20 mhz) when not needeed. this would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the cpu even with a heat sink. of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board. i haven't started probing around inside my si yet. does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators? thanks. <<< tom dickens: boeing computer services tpd6908@yak.ca.boeing.com >>> <<< these statements are mine and not boeing's >>>

i'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system. what i would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for their quality and performance. my preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and 1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity. so far, i only know a bit about the iomega floptical and the infinity floptical drives. are there any comments/recommendations for either of these? are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc). thanks in advance. please send replies directly to umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca ---- mike sorokowski		(umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca)

i remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a centris. . . i was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions. my pli 80m syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case. where do i connect this switch?? can the computer just "tell" with internal drives? 	i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (i didn't look closely, but i seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard? would that cause problems? 	one last question! is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover? the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsbm clone's cases). should i just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place? ans are welcomed! thanks! keith moffatt kmoffatt@vax2.cstp.umkc.edu

hi there, i have a question regarding quadras vram. i have tried to find info on this but i could not get precise answers. on one hand, we have a quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of 32-bit color. how much vram does it have? on the other hand, we have a quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 ko of vram. i would like to take vram simms for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that both machines have 16-bit color capability. is it possible, and if yes, how many vram simms should i take from the 950? from the documentation i have, the quadra 800 must get 1 mo vram to have 16-bit color, is that correct? bonus question: where do vram simms hide? from the 950 documentation, they seem to be *behind* the power supply. do i really have to take off the power supply to access the vram simms? thanks for your help! -- daniel salber, user interface research team, lgi-imag, grenoble, france. salber@imag.fr

hi all: thanks to you all who have responded to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem. i'd like to ask a few more questions. 1. what are the advantages of buying a global village teleport gold over other cheaper brands like supra, zoom etc? 2. i heard that both supra and zoom use the same software. why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of supra? what kind of incompatibility is it? 3. if i decided to buy the teleport gold, is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future? 4. has anyone heard of a possible voice option that supra will offer this coming summer? 5. a person did mention a new at&t modem. is it getting good reviews from various mac magazines? 6. if i want the best, fastest, most economically sound and possible voice option, what fax modem should i buy? sorry for posting so many questions, but i think they're necessary. i promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder. thanks so much in advance. regards, thian.

i am having trouble with scsi on a mac iifx. the machine is 3 years old and i have been using the same hard drive (internal maxtor lxt-200s) for two and a half years. the disk recently crashed. i reformatted (silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat i received random write errors during testing. the error message reported was like: sector 0: write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out. this occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to sector 0 ??? ). on the third reformat and after reinstalling the scsi read/write loops i was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) i decided to go ahead and try to resinstall system 7 and reload my data from a backup. this proceded normally; however, i now have sub-optimal performance. symptoms include: o frequent crashes o instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to correct. o instances of not finding the disk on the scsi chain on reboot. - if i boot from norton utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the disk either. - the only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. it sometimes requires several attempts. questions: 1) has anyone had this type of problem before? 2) is the problem with the fx motherboard (and its non-standard scsi implementation) or with my maxtor disk? is there some diagnostic software that would help me make this determination? 3) is it a termination problem? i currently have external syquest and an external dataframe xp60 on the chain. the xp60 is at the end, and has internal termination; so i am not using the iifx terminator. i do have the scsi filter installed on the internal drive. i have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago). i also have symptoms if i disconnect the external devices; so i don't see how scsi termination would now be an issue. of course who knows :-< help would be much appreciated. forrest e. lumpkin iii nasa ames research center lumpkin@corvus.arc.nasa.gov

------ x-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers ------- you've heard about apple's great new customer "support" program. well, think again. sometimes the only real support out there is what apple computer users can give to each other. for another example, read on: in the march 15th issue of _macweek_, ric ford described a two-year effort by liam breck to document and bring to apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice. at random, the switches on these mice "stick" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in malaysia and have an fcc id of bcga65431. you'll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle. liam breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead suggested that people contact apple's customer assistance center directly (_macweek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). when i called apple on march 23rd and described my defective mouse, i was eventually given a case number (f83y) and told apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty. after waiting for three weeks, i called back today wondering where my new mouse was. this time, i was told that apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (mb13831fc25) is not within the (undisclosed) range apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing i can do about it. nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. please, if you have one of these mice, i need your help! don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. instead, let apple do it. please take five minutes to call apple right now at: united states 1-800-776-2333 canada 800-665-2775 uk and europe 33-1-49-01-49-01 australia 61-2-452-8000 japan and pacific 81-3-5411-8500 if the number isn't toll-free, call collect. describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse. even if they refuse, insist that they register the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number. be firm. network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user bases. everyone ask your friends and colleagues. please don't send mail to me or post yet another "sticky-button" report, call apple directly! if enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, apple will eventually be forced to respond. if apple continues to find it easy to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the next, potentially more serious mac defect is uncovered. -- bill sloan
hello all! for few past days i've been fighting to get my nec multisync 3d (predecessor of 3fg) to work properly with the internal video of mac iivi. with a vga-adapter (as described in dale adams' posting about quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear. but because the scanrates & stuff of 3d are well enough for emulating apple 13" rgb, i first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of nec. with both adapters i can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. but with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. the picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. even when it is clear, there are some "spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. with the self-made adapter, almost identical to the vga one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... with the adapter from nec, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. but not nearly as often as with the self-made one. i know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by nec... where's the source of this interference? i'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and i hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for nec 3d. i am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged, especially syncs and groundings. yes, i have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works perfectly well with all pc graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and also atari 71hz monochrome, which i am using now with it. here are the pinouts & stuff: 15 pin mini d-sub (nec 3d)		15 pin d-sub (mac, at least quadra) 1 red video				1 red gnd 2 green video				2 red video 3 blue video				3 composite sync 4 gnd					4 sense 0 5 gnd					5 green video 6 red gnd				6 green gnd 7 green gnd				7 sense 1 8 blue gnd				8 nc 9 nc					9 blue video 10 gnd					10 sense 2 11 gnd					11 c.sync & v.sync gnd 12 nc					12 v.sync 13 h.sync				13 blue gnd 14 v.sync				14 h.sync gnd 15 nc					15 h.sync shell gnd				shell gnd connection suggested by apple for vga/svga, sense pins changed to emulate apple 13" with multisync (my self-made adapter) multisync (15pin mini d-sub)	mac (15pin d-sub) 	 	 1 ---------------------- 2 	 2 ---------------------- 5 	 3 ---------------------- 9 	 6 ---------------------- 1 	 7 ---------------------- 6 	 8 ---------------------- 13 	 10 ---------------------- 14 	 13 ---------------------- 15 	 14 ---------------------- 12 				 4 (sense0) grounded to 11 (sync gnd) connection measured from an adapter to make nec 3fg/4fg emulate apple 13" (adapter provided by nec representative) 	nec (15 mini) 	mac (15) 	1 ----------------------- 2 	2 ----------------------- 5 	3 ----------------------- 9 	4 ----------------------- shell gnd, 1, 4, 6, 13 	5 ----------------------- same as above 	6 ----------------------- same... 	7 ----------------------- same... 	8 ----------------------- same... 	10 ----------------------- same... 	11 ----------------------- same... 	13 ----------------------- 3 	14 * not connected! * 	 well, i am waiting for your solutions... and thanks! -- jartsu

yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac iicx internally. this is definitely not a recommended procedure by apple but i have done the equivalent to my cx after upgrading it to a quadra 700. the power supply is still the stock cx's and it was able to power two quantum lps drives, a pli scsi accelerator, a micron technologies 24 bit video board, daystar quickcache, new technologies overdrive and 20 meg of ram simultaneously. i added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower. the internal scsi cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which i added an extra connector about midway. the final hd was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had its terminator resistor packs removed. cooling has not been a problem and no scsi problems occur with either the pli scsi chain or motherboard scsi hooked into the two internal hard drives. it works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.
i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different speeds. there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. a quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive.

if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this may be the problem. for a couple of months after the release of the duo, some memory manufacturers were shipping duo memory cards w/ improper (non-self-refreshing) chips. if you have a third party card, pull it and see if the sleep problem recurs. - tim

hello fellow humans, and other net creatures... if you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu i'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so i have two monitors and cards for sale. nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, i'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen. i'd prefer to sell to people near austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but i can ship to you if you don't live near here. only problem is that i didn't keep the original boxes for the monitors, but i'm confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction. details: mirror full page display (monochrome) w/nubus card: --------------------------------------------------- **sold** sony 1304 14" color monitor: ---------------------------- what's to say? it got top ratings in last year's macuser report. it's a sony, trinitron, arguably the best (but i'd rather not argue that point). it's a great monitor, in great shape, but i'm going to a bigger screen, and although i'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it. still selling for $599 at macland (where i bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable. rasterops 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg ram): ------------------------------------------------------------------ renamed the 24sx a few months after i bought it, this board is for 13" monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, ntsc mode (you can plug it into something like the rasterops video expander and output ntsc), and 4 ram slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg simms for gworld ram, or a ram disk. software included for such functions. 4 meg of ram included (1 meg simms). selling for $605 at bottom line (without the ram - add $100), i'm asking **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). original box and packaging. i'd actually prefer to sell the sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer" for these items. ------------ cheers. dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ dan keldsen | are you now, or have you ever been: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu | a. a berklee college student? univ. of texas, austin | b. a member/fan of billy death? music composition, mm | c. a max programmer? m & m consultant (ask) | d. a think-c & midi programmer?

according to the official documentation, failure to use the iifx terminator can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus. whether this is your problem or not i don't know. i have had sporadic scsi problems with my iifx since i bought it. (i cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems). first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. if it formats fine then i would try to format it on your system with no externals. if this fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repair/replacement. hope this helps. -- david c. salmon salmon@unomaha.edu

(of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...) nubus technology isn't a special apple proprietry thing (i have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box. the difference between nubus and pds is that nubus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. pds (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. you can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. you may be able to get double pds slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! of course, the extra electronics in a nubus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines? so, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice. bill (wis@liverpool.ac.uk)

(why not? they advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?) they do sell a cutout for their cd-rom drive (of course), but that's of no use. i'm going to hack up the extra bezel i ordered to make a cutout for my tape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device. good luck with your syquest. 	-fred

a week or so ago, i posted about a problem with my se/30: i have 20 megs or true ram, yet if i set my extensions to use a large amount of memory (total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder comes up. what i meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than apple's memory control panel. apple's cache is at 64k, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing. all extensions work by themselves or with the others until i increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above). well, here's my latest followup... i ran nows system profile and got this information: %%% memory info %%% physical ram size: 20480k. logical ram size: 20480k. size of low memory area: 8k. virtual memory: inactive. addressing mode: 32bit mode in use. 32 bit system zone: absent. parity ram: not capable. growable system heap: true. temporary memory support: present. tempory memory support: real and tracked. note that 32 bit system zone is absent. could this be the problem? how can i turn this on? any ideas? can anyone help? ken

hi everyone. just the other day, i ordered a vram chip for my new lciii from mac connection. they sent it overnight (very nice) and i got it installed, and we found that it didn't work properly. when you put the computer in thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering and fuzzy. so i called them up and i'm going to return it for a new one. my question is, how often does such a thing happen with simm chips in general? do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? is this a rarity? this is the first chip i've ordered so i have no other experience in this area. i'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of experience. that's about it. please email me, and if people want, i can post a summary. thanks all. -- hillel sims ----- simsh@rpi.edu ----- rensselaer polytechnic institute "is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?" 	--anonymous
here is the story: i have a network with 4 macs on localtalk. one of them has an ethernet card, and is currently connected to a next (don't laugh i got it for the price of a mac iisi). the next is connected to the internet over slip running on a 9600 baud modem. currently, we can telnet from the mac w/ ethernet to the next, and then telnet out again to the rest of the world. what we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the localtalk macs to the next via the ethernet mac. from what we have heard, air doesn't do the trick. software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any. our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet out again. the slip connection doesn't allow us to assign ip numbers to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well... thanks in advance. -- _______________________________________________________________ benjamin s. chuang/itd-css consultant/university of michigan:a2 benjamin.chuang@um.cc.umich.edu (consulting & referals here) bchuang@css.itd.umich.edu (unix and long messages here)

	hello, 	i remember running across an ad in the back of mac[user|world] a few years ago, for a nubus board that had umpteen simm slots, to be used to "recycle your old simms," when you upgraded memory. i don't remember who made this board, and i haven't seen it advertised in any of the latest mac magazines. it mentioned that it included software to make the simms on the board act like a ram disk. as someone who has simms he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly good idea. does anyone out there know what board/company i'm talking about? are they still in business, or does anyone know where i can get a used one if they are no longer made? any help would be greatly appreciated. please e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth. 	thanks, 	cap. -- | internet: cptnerd@digex.com | aol: cptnerd | compuserve: 70714,105 | consilio manuque otium cum dignitate credo quia absurdum est parturient montes nascetur ridiculus mus

i know that jet inc makes refills for the stylewriter and deskwriter ink jet cartridges in several colors....but are pre-filled cartridges in color available from anyone (or do i have to use-up one cartridge before i have a chance to print in color?) also, are inks in process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) available to refill cartridges? thanks in advance....
hi there, does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c650 regarding fpu? in all mac price lists i've seen, every c650 has the message "fpu: optional". i know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all c650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration. why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list? i'm planning to buy the c650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but i'm now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not. why say "optional" if it's built in? please, anybody help me understand this game. regards, thian.
anyone out there have a sony 1304s? i have one, and it's very nice, however - if i run it in 16" mode, the picture won't go very big. i end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top & bottom. i suspect an internal adjustment would fix this. anyone tried it? another problem is sub-brightness: areas that are meant to be black (or off the main raster) are not very black. the real raster is quite visible when the screen is blanked. this is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other trini screens i have used. if i turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not visible, the real image virtually disappears! the raster size is just right if i use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too much! oh, and i am using a rasterops 24xli card. thanks marcus bointon marcus@meridian.demon.co.uk ------------------------------------------------------- marcus bointon tel 081 852 6662 marcus@meridian.demon.co.uk fax 081 244 5422 "i used windows for a week once, but i feel better now" -------------------------------------------------------

this is turning into a faq here is how to violate your quadra 700 warranty and install your own memory. 1) insert usual disclaimer here 2) remove the top lid of the machine. you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this. unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back 	of the mac. 3) remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up. the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply. leave that alone. the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release. 4) look at the rear of the tower assembly. you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive. disconnect all these from the motherboard. the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it. 5) unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount 6) look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. a phillips head screw is at the base. remove it, taking care not to drop it into the case. a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here. 7) remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower. this tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. 8) congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's simm slots. 9) the six big slots are for vram. one usually must install all six to gain useful video modes. all simms (ram or vram) installed with their 	chips facing the front of the motherboard. 	 the four smaller sockets in front are for ram simms. install simms in 	sets of four into these sockets. be sure you seat the simms squarely 	and firmly into a fully upright position. 	 10) reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case. once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place. 	 11) reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. dont't forget the floppy drive cable. 12) replace the phillips head screw 13) drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. 14) plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount guy kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker. make sure that all the power cords are in the same strip. if you don't you take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz. this is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you have a common ground. make sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the same outlet. this will assure you of a common ground. tim keanini sound designer <timk@broder.com> broderbund software <blast@crl.com>
does anyone know if there are any devices available for the mac which will increase the number of serial ports available for use simultaneously? i would like to connect up to 8 serial devices to my mac for an application i am working on. i must be able to access each one of the independently. if such a device exists, are there are any limits to the number of serial devices i can use? any information is appreciated. steven langlois slang@bnr.ca

i just hooked up my mac iisi to a relatively old (1 year?) asante en/sc adapter. the 10base-t connection works like a charm. i installed the newest drivers from asante's ftp server. the problem begins when i attach one more device to the scsi chain - specifically a 50mb drive. i power up the drive, then the mac. the mac tests memory, etc. just before the "happy mac face" normally shows up, the power light on the en/sc goes out, and the boot process stops. so i can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. this makes the asante box pretty much unusable. it doesn't look like a purely electrical scsi problem, because if i turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial scsi polling, the mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. the mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and i've had it for over a year). here is what i tried: changing the scsi id's of the en/sc and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the en/sc at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another en/sc box; trying another identical drive; trying several different scsi cables. has anybody seen this? more importantly, does anyone have a solution? thanks a lot. e. -- eric behr, illinois state university, mathematics department behr@math.ilstu.edu or behr@ilstu.bitnet (please avoid!)

hi. i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra 900, but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem on his powerbook 170. any info or experience anyopne has would be greatly appreciated. when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types of sounds (mono, as far as i can tell) all play fine through both speakers: system beeps (already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record) armor alley spectre spaceward ho! but, the following games only play out of the left channel: lemmings out of this world (awesome game, btw) glider 4.0 oids but still, stereo system beeps do play in stereo, through both speakers. (the one i'm specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning, which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?)) all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run ootw because he doesn't have color). we're both running system 7.1 does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class, quadra, lc, powerbook 140 or greater, centris, se/30, etc... (stereo) machine? i used to have a mac ii, and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel. (i could be mistaken, though. if there were a problem with the quad 900's and pb 170's, i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo? if there isn't a problem with our machines, i wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers (like spectre, etc. do)? quadra 900's and powerbook 170's have the same roms (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a rom problem?

it's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written is that correct? thanks, jim frazier 73447.3113@compuserve.com

peter, i'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want to do, but i'll tell you how we do it where i work. we have about 15 macs networked together using appletalk and phonenet connectors. to chat we use a program called 'broadcast'. with it we can send brief messages to all or selected machines within the network. hope that helps... steed

regarding the post for information about the mac portable and the powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers: (1) does the mac portable support appletalk? yes (2) what cpu is in the mac portable? a low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 mhz. (3) does the mac portable run system 7? yes, although it does use up a lot of memory. (4) is memory still availabe for the portable? there are several vendors that still make ram for the portable. there are two options: some vendors sell memory that plugs into the ram slot inside the portable. others sell memory that plugs into the processor direct slot. either way, the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether the portable is backlit or not. king memory and peripherials in irvine california is the cheapest place i know of for portable memory. 2mb - $140, 4 mb, $250, and 7 mb $415. i still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 mb modules for $450. wide variety in pricing here. (5) what is the internal hd? its a conner cp-3045 40 mb hd with an average access time of about 25 ms. (6) is the screen better that the pb 100? heavens yes! the pb 100 is a backlit passive matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right. the portable has a backlit or non-backlit active matrix screen which i think is a joy to read. other things to consider - where to get the portable and how much to pay for it? a good supplier has been selectterm in mass. they were willing to sell a 2mb non-backlit portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $650. or a 4 mb backlit portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $900. the answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much. i'm still looking for an internal fax modem for the portable? anybody got one they want to sell? -- good luck, gene wright -- gene@theporch.raider.net (gene wright) theporch.raider.net 615/297-7951 the macinteresteds of nashville

hi everyone. i recently posted about how i received a bad vram chip for my new lciii, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may be a 512k lc vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. so i'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so i can figure out what type of chip macconnection sent me. each chip says: m518121a-80j 		 2515251 on the back of the card, it says 0593 i believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but i can't figure out what the size is supposed to be. if anyone can help, i'd be grateful. please email me your response. thanks a lot! -- hillel sims ----- simsh@rpi.edu ----- rensselaer polytechnic institute "is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?" 	--anonymous

some kind soul told me that i could change the serial port buffer size of zterm via resedit. he did not tell me how i could change it using resedit, and i have lost his e-mail address. could he or any one else please tell me what to do? i assume that the relevant resource is zset, but i do not know, and i have no template for that resource. if you have a tmpl for the correct resource, i would be grateful to receive it. that way, i could play around a bit and maybe get my duo to do something useful with its serial port. (other than appletalk). btw, i believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are using hardware handshaking. i can cram text data pretty fast into my duo, and can monitor that cts is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond 3074 (out of 4096) bytes. makes sense to me. scott petrack petrack@haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com

i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a mac duo 210 and a pc. i have used mackermit and versaterm on the mac side. i have used procomm, kermit, and softerm (on os/2) on the pc (or ps) side. i have used non-hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables. and know my hands are shaking from the effort. nothing has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps. in general, i can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides are set to speeds over 9600 baud. i cannot send files from the mac to the ps at all, and file transfers from the duo to the ps are not possible. when i do a straight ascii send, i can send from the ps to the duo flawlessly. i can send binhex files this way quite fast, and i know that the transmission is error free. but straight ascii sent from the mac to the ps is full of errors. unless, of course, i do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing). i would like to hear from anyone who has been able to transfer files from a duo 210 to a ps via modem or null modem. if you can do it, please tell me your exact combination of hardware and software. obviously, i am talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a duo 210 can check this out for me. right now, i am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the duo, and it won't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason i don't understand. could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a duo 210 fast? like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump? could anyone with a duo help me out?? i am going absolutely insane. i wanna know if the problem is my duo, or all duo 210s, or all duos, or just me. yes, i have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. and not only can i type back and forth, but zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and cts is down. so i know that hardware handshaking is working. and also, according to zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows. please help me figure out what's going on... scott petrack petrack@haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com

hi. i am working on a project for my marketing class and i'd like to ask your help. the assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it. technical issues are not terribly important at this point. well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor for laptop computers. it would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like newer technology's palettebook screen). the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!). in fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular or "full" height. the screen would probably be monochrome. the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people. business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document. because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity. we could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000. now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous. i really need some constructive feedback. so, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1. if you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen 2. how much you would be willing to pay for it 3. any helpful commentaries on the idea also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some. thanks in advance!!! -mike
dear mac-friends, i've seen the following problem om three mac iisi machines all with 17 mb ram installed (70 or 80 ns simms). if the contents of a window are being calculated and updated a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated on the screen. the lines translate to the top of the screen and have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they are a few millimeters apart). i admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly, especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark. applications which produce this effect are: - the previewer of directtex 1.2 (i.e. dvireader 1.2) - kaleidagraph 2.1.1/fpu the machines use their built-in video and drive the old apple hires monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried). the effect is independent of the settings in the following control panels: memory (adressing mode, disk cache) and monitors (nr of greys/colors). have you ever seen this effect too ? is there a solution ? thanks, fred ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- fred walsteijn | internet: walsteyn@fys.ruu.nl institute for marine and atmospheric research | fax: 31-30-543163 utrecht university, the netherlands | phone: 31-30-533169

my company has developed an application for the mac that emulates a chart recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen. as we tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some surprising performance differences across products. the scroll performance of the iisi and lcii was better than the iifx. this led us to investigate color quickdraw performance across the apple line. the results: the fastest quickdraw color performing computer apple makes is the (drumroll please) lciii. and the color classic ranks right up there with the quadra line. the centris line pales in comparison. does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the disparity in graphics/processor performance? dave steele (daves@xetron.com) (513)881-3330 xetron corp. 40 w. crescentville road cincinnati, ohio 45246

hi! a while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the iwii in europe (in countries with 50 hz ac current). the consensus at the time was that the iwii would not work there. as i will be moving there this summer, i called apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the iwii (as bought in the u.s.) will definitely run on 50 hz ac current (as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 v current is used). the same info, turns out, can be found in the iwii manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but i didn't really trust that. does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary? just wondering. chris w.

i have an se/30 with a 80 meg hd which dates back to april 1989. when i originally purchased it, i experienced the failure to boot problem. this was fixed soon after by a rom upgrade on the hard drive. lately a similar problem has been occuring. when the computer is powered on the hd light flashes a few times and then i am given the "no disk to boot from" icon. however, upon turing the computer off and on again the drive always boots up just fine. furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off i press the reboot button the same problem occurs. but, as i said, turning the power off and on always works. this problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot. does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed? i'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to "come up to speed" now. is there a pram or scsi setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the hd? thanks! altan j. stalker astalker@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu indiana university computer science dept.

"which mac..." is a hypercard stack that assists in decision making based on budget, features, and main software used. please let me know if you can help me out. download from compuserve should not cost much if a higher speed modem is used. stack, compressed, is about 125kb? thanks for any help... dale carsona@sfu.ca .
i'm in the market for a laser printer. used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer i get must fit the following: required features: - postscript - 300 dpi - emough memory to download fonts - the cheaper, the better. i'd prefer under $1000. nice things: - anything over 4 pages per minute - scsi output for a font disk - smallish footprint don't care about: - postscript level ii - networking (its just for me, and always will be) - color i know about freedom of press, but i've also heard that its painfully slow. i can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and i'm not going to consider the price savings worth it. i'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho. i also infinitely prefer laser over ink; i used to use hp deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality. i'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :) i'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book i'm writing. the page will include multiple fonts, ps graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet). the quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable. printers i've been looking at: - used laserwriters: the plus, the nt, the ntr. its my understanding that only the ntr has a scsi out for a disk. true? - personal laserwriter (ls and ntr). i have access to the apple employee discount (i work for one of apple's spinoffs), so i can get these reasonably cheaply. i've heard bad things about the ls; comments? i'm leaning towards the personal ntr, cause it has a nice small footprint. - laserwriter select 300. i hear it doesn't have postscript, but i haven't seen anything for sure. i heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade." ?? - used hp laserjets. i've worked with the ii and iip on another platform, and they were *painfully* slow. are they that bad on the mac? - i've seen ads for an epson ps laserprinter that is running quite cheap. any comments on this printer? i hate the styling (too many ouput trays), but if its a decent printer i'll consider it. thanks for any comments... -- ********************************************************* laura lemay lemay@netcom.com writer of trifles in shadows and blood *********************************************************

i've recently ordered a centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to buy. i'm pretty sure i want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k, but is it worth it? i'll primarily only be 'conversing' over compuserve or some other link to the internet, but i'm not sure if those systems can supply me with data at 14.4k. another question i have is in some of the modem lingo out there. i understand baud rates, but what does v3.4 and v3.4bis mean? i could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice. thanks for your time. dave bell dbell@coral.bucknell.edu "those who forget the past are condemned to re-live it." --duncan macleod

i'm currently having trouble connecting my pb to a true blue (ibm model 1513) vga monitor. the display is bearly readable but all the details are seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one in yellow and a ghost image in red. the background is also a little greenish. i read some time ago, before i ever thought i would hook my mac up to a vga screen, about an incompatability with some vga monitors due to the sync on green signal. does this sound like it could be the same demon? i also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem. i don't the details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them? i checked all the faq's for this and didn't find anything about it. did i miss it somewhere? this sure seems that it would be a good thing to have in one. thanks for any replys. charles kuehmann northwestern university steel research group

just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. top three contenders seem to be at&t paradyne, zyxel, and us robotics. zyxel has the biggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but i ignored it because i need something with mac software, which will work without any tweaking. the at&t dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. they are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until may. its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. warning: at&t ads say that the modem comes with a mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. this applies *only* when you order directly from paradyne! i called elektek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty... usr sportster for the mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from clubmac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the faxstf software, you can get the generic model from pc outlets for $190. all this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a motorola codex... :-( i ended up ordering the dataport; we'll see how it works in two weeks or so. -- eric behr, illinois state university, mathematics department behr@math.ilstu.edu or behr@ilstu.bitnet (please avoid!)

jeff, i have answers to both of your questions. first, i recommend the sony cpd-1320 monitor. it is a 14" trinitron vga monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the lc. it works only with macs with specific video capabilities which means only the lc's and anything after the ci. all it takes is a mac<->vga cable (i recommend one from james engineering which is about $20). these cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch. i have used one for half a year and i love it. second, i have used syex and found them to be decent. i had a backorder on a supra modem which i cancelled. they were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had supra's number ready for me. the only complaint was that they did not always return my calls. i have been told that the cpd-1320 is selling for $339 from j&r's (800)221-8180. i think syex is a little more, but i don't know. -david **** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in **** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views.

the subject says what i would like to do, here are the details: i have a 512ke with the macrescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a plus (system 7 and macenvy both identify it as such). the macrescue board clips onto the 68000 on the mb. it also has a 68000 itself. periodically i have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000. larry pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades: the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing unusual system errors. well, that's me. so, i would like to do something permanent, and i think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the macrescue board to plug in. what i'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work. it seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my mac. i'm about 97% sure. will someone provide the extra 3%? erik erik@cheshire.oxy.edu
i remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest. has anyone else heard anything about this? i'd be interested in the cost per megabyte and the approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the bernoulli 150.
we have a user that has word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and other mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc. the document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine. when she tries to print it on a iig the pi changes to an upside down caret, and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of character, plus some little circles appear between words of the fractions instead of spaces. this happens on a iig laser printer. tried it on serveral macs and two different iig's. prints fine on an nt and ntx laser printers. what's wrong??? thanks for any help in advance, gary -- *************************************************************************** gary weis university computer center 400 hal greer boulevard huntington, west virginia 25755-5320 phone: (304) 696-3205 fax : (304) 696-3601 internet: gary@marshall.wvnet.edu bitnet : gary@marshall ucc net : gary ***************************************************************************
	the quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware, read's pram, obtains all info from last session including the volume setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and wait's on the scsi controller to respond to the boot up code. if the dram produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 'sad mac' sound. this is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac. if you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel there is something incorrect with the logic board. my quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having. steve h

well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after starting life as a 512k way back in 1985. sooo, i'm in the market for a new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be... i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer: * does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook introductions are expected? i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an appearence "this summer" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had more info... * has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the ones the duo's just went through recently? * what's the impression of the display on the 180? i could probably swing a 180 if i got the 80mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have a feel for how much "better" the display is (yea, it looks great in the store, but is that all "wow" or is it really that good?). could i solicit some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display? (i realize this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful). * how well does hellcats perform? ;) thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the corner... :( ) -- tom willis \ twillis@ecn.purdue.edu \ purdue electrical engineering --------------------------------------------------------------------------- "convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies." - f. w. nietzsche

1) i have an old jasmine drive which i cannot use with my new system. my understanding is that i have to upsate the driver with a more modern one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1. does anyone know of an inexpensive program to do this? ( i have seen formatters for <$20 buit have no idea if they will work) 2) i have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which the back utility freezes the system if i try to use it. the drive is a jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar mechanism). essentially i have the same question as above, anyone know of an inexpensive beckup utility i can use with system 7.0.1 all help and advice appriciated.
question for those familiar with quadra vram: i put 2 256k vram simms in my quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the ram simm slots) and i got no results whatsoever. i have been told that the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on a macintosh color display. however, the monitors control panel still lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible. does it make any difference which slots you put the simms in? do you have to do something to activate them? do you have to do something to the monitors control panel? btw, i am running system 7.1 with 8 megs of ram. --- charles p. cox, jr. computer engineering case western reserve university cpc3@po.cwru.edu cox@snowhite.eeap.cwru.edu

interestingly enough, the cdrom 300i that came with my quadra 800 has only 8 disks: 1. system install 2. kodak photo cd sampler 3. alice to ocean 4. cdrom titles 5. application demos 6. mozart: dissonant quartet 7. nautilus 8. apple chronicles has anyone else noticed that they got less than everyone seems to be getting with the external? what i really feel i missed out on is what is supposed to a fantastic games demo disk. i have heard that people have gotten up to 9-10 disks with their drive. i assume they get the 8 titles above plus cinderella and the games demo cdrom. any comments and experiences? should i call apple to complain? =) derek thewho@plume.mit.edu

040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but intel has chips at higher frequencies than motorola, so this evens out. the macintosh bible 4th ed. supports the comparisons between intel and motorola chips for the 68020 and above. <=80186 ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address lines/data & address registers]. the 4mb limit on the 68000 macs brings it down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.} 286 ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit alu and these chips come have no usable built-in mmu unlike their successors [80386, 68030]. the hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by os/2 1.0 => and windows 3.x. the use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between the 60000 and 68030 in features and the lc's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 286 ~ 68020 comparison.} 386 ~ 68030 {two 32-bit chips with mmus, and protected memory. a/ux 3.0 is at present the only mac os to use the 68030's protected memory feature for apps. system 7.x uses this feature to protect a ram disk created by the memory control panel but this is supported only on powerbooks and quadras. the color classic and lcii 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them comparative to 386sxs.} 486sx ~ 68lc040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the fpu;

quickdraw qx will change this. in addition, quickdraw allows, in macs with a nubus slot, more then one monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures. vram: video ram. standard for present non-powerbook mac's handling of built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. vram provided runs a 8-bit color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. sound output: standard in all macs since the 128k. stereo sound became standard with the se/30. ibm: even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware (nan zou), the use of drivers bypassing bios, video hareware inconsitancies {see super vga below} and nonstanderzation of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware, os and program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question (faisal nameer jawdat). in addition, ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present (matt healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like mac's qd}. as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes, especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, os, print driver and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, os, and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with an ibm. for example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a os/2 486 with a svga monitor on a 386 with vga {18-bit color palette} and dos 5.0 and still have all the colors one started out with}. later ibm machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, cd rom, and ethernet (pc week 12/14/92). mda: monocrome display adapter original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. cga: color graphics array 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. ega: enhanced graphics array 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. vga: video graphics array* 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are the most commonly used. all modes have a 256k clut, from a 18 to 24-bit {ibm} or a 32-bit {mac} color palette. 25.175 mhz pixel clock (mel martinez). monitors use analog input, incompatible with ttl signals from ega/cga etc. mcga: multi-color graphics array* subset of vga that provides all the features of mda & cga, but lacks some ega and vga modes, like vga 640x480x16 (dictionary of computer terms-dct). common on the initial ps/1 implementation from ibm and some ps/2 models. svga: super vga* this is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch all' category for a group of video cards. as such, with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme, svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not. in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units, but things are still a mess. video is either 512k [~1990] or 1m [today], resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 1990] have the sierra hicolor ramdac, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually at 640x480]. speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [western digital paradise based, for example], some very fast [s3 86c911 based, for example], some are so-so [like tseng et4000, a very popular chipset]. some limiting factors overcome by 40mhz vl bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 8.33 mhz isa bus, at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a 64k "window", etc. other non-svga standards: 8514/a: ibm's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. some clone implementations from ati are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do not have interlacing. tms34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like cad. xga: extended graphics array newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for mca bus-based ps/2s, clones are coming out soon. emulates vga, ega, and cga (dct). max resolution at 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. xga-2 accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard vga in windows and os/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area fills, masking and x/y addressing. has an intelligent way to detect and co- exist with other xga-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the mac may not be far away. since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth isn't fixed {ibm implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other companies can have 24-bit color through ibm technical licenses}. refresh rates up to 75 hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual discomfort, and is vga compatible. up to 1280x1024 on os/2. *some monitor types usable by mac-see mac section above for specific details. expansion both mac & ibm scsi: only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm. allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, nubus card expansion {mac plus only}, some monitors, and cd-rom. main problem: there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port {a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end. any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm}. scsi-1: 7 devices per scsi controller. 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5mb/s ave} and synchronous {5mb/s max} transfers. difference is due to scsi-1 software drivers. "fast scsi-1" is a misname for 8-bit scsi-2 in scsi-1 mode {see scsi-2 for details}. scsi-2: 10 devices per scsi controller in scsi-2 mode. scsi-2 is fully scsi-1 compliant and 8-bit scsi-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit scsi-2 do. transfer speeds are 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}. since 8-bit scsi-2 can use scsi-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit scsi-2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast scsi-1". 16-bit fast scsi-2 requires a scsi-2 software driver and scsi-2 electronics but can still use the scsi-1 ports. wide 16-bit and 32-bit scsi-2 require a different scsi port, electronics, and software driver from scsi-1 {which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces}. mac scsi: asynchronous scsi-1 built-in standard since the plus. even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers, the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces. as a result present scsi-2 macs use 8-bit scsi-2 as a fast asynchronous scsi-1. presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi-2 controller chip built-in (digital review, oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide scsi-2 port interface. since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi-2, older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu. rumor-some cyclone macs {june} will come with a wide & fast scsi-2 port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager. ibm scsi: scsi-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with systems, except as add-on {eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable}. like the mac, 8-bit scsi-2 is used as a very fast scsi-1 by most controllers out there. unlike the mac, ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi. mac memory expansion: with a few exceptions the mac has used non-parity 30-pin 8-bit simm memory expansion since the plus. while 32-pin 9-bit parity simms could be used in these macs, only special iicis could make use of the parity feature {by convension both simm types are called 32-pin simms}. the iifx used 64-pin parity simms. the lc iii, c610/650 and q800 all use a new 72-pin simm that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in ibms. the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is. since macs made before feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, simms had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}. the centris 650 and quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time. if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two simms resulting in a 10-15% performance boost on ram access (macworld apr 93: 108-109). printers, adbs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. pds: available in se & all present non-powerbook macs. 16-bit {se, portable, lc, lc ii, classic line} and 32-bit. operates at cpu's mhz. maximum through put: data path in bytes*cpu's mhz {q700/900 & c650: 4 * 25mhz = 100mb/s; q800 & q950: 4 * 33mhz = 132mb/s}. standardized with the lc and 040 bus designs. with an adapter one nubus card can be used in iisi and c610. problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows through put down. nubus mac ii: 32-bit, 10 mhz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio, and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20mb/s; theoretical peak: 40mb/s. built-in on all modular macs except the lc series, c610, and performa 400. the se/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a mac plus scsi nubus. supports every possible expansion from cpu to ethernet to dma. nubus 90: nubus mac ii back compatable. 20mhz bus clock, avg throughput: ~30mb/s; burst mode: 80mb/s. future card designs will be 7" instead of the old 12". quickring: a peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with nubus 90. apple's vlbus - "architecture is identical to that of vlbus" (byte 10/92:128). burst mode: 350mb/s (byte 10/92:128). in development. cpu expansion: handled either through the pds or the nubus. unlike pds, nubus cpu cards {example-radius rocket} allow use of multiple processors at the same time. this is like having two or more macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {each nubus card needs its own memory but most nubus cards of this type come with 8mb ram simms on the card standard}. ibm memory expansion: parity simms, non-parity simms {some newer models do a mac- like simm memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards. hd interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: mfm: modified frequency modulation, rll: run length limited only used with smaller [� 60mb] hard drives. ide: integrated device electronics asynchronous {~5mb/s max} and synchronous {8.3mb/s max} transfer. currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized drives. can have more than one hard drive. esdi: enhanced small device interface ~1.25mb/s throughput. generally considered better interface than scsi-1 in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration. outside of hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to scsi-1. bus interfaces {new 'plug and play' isa and eisa compatable cards may have problems working with old cards (infoworld; pc week 03/08/93; vaporware 4/93).} isa 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a 16mb limit for which there are software workarounds} (pc mag 4/27/93:105). 1.5 mb/s (byte 3/93:132). uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them, hence comes the irq conflict. limited busmastering capabilities, some cards aren't bandwidth limited {com ports, lpt ports, game ports, midi card, etc.} while others are {video and disk controllers}. dominant factor, but it's showing its age. most isa motherboard designs are 16-bit (pc world feb 1993: 144-5)}. mca {micro channel} ibm's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one cpu in a computer" (dct) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components involved can handle it. never took off because it was incompatible with isa and eisa. planned to be bus interface of ibm powerpc 601 (carl jabido). eisa {nubus mac ii is closest mac equivalent} 32-bit, 8.33 mhz, burst mode: 33mb/s. it also has the ability to self-configure cards like mca and allows multiple bus masters, sharable interrupt and dma channels and multiple cpu use. vesa local bus: vlb {sometimes mistakenly refereed to as pds} local bus standard. runs at cpu clock rate, burst modes: ~130 mb/s{32-bit} 250 mb/s{64-bit} (byte 10/92:128). limited to three slots but allows bus mastering and will coexist with either isa or eisa. consitered ideal for video and disk i/o. dell has filled a claim that this violates one of their patents (mel martinez). quickring: apple's faster {350 mb/s burst} version of vlb architecture (byte 10/92:132). might show up in some ibm and powerpc machines (byte 10/92:132-133). in development. pci intel's version of local bus that is intended to totally replace isa/eisa/mca. in development. oses {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} mac 512k to 1mb of os and hardware commands have been put into rom. this allows apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the mac os {quickdraw, menu commands, print, mouse, scsi & sound drivers, etc} in rom, which require clone makers to use the rom chip or read rom on to disks {which requires access to the proper mac since different macs have slightly different rom chips; plus vs classic for example.} with key hooks for the os support interface in rom, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk os has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs. this also allows apple greater control over hardware-software standards and that the disk os can be smaller and, with some of the tookbox command code in rom, with lower ram requirements then a totally disk based os. macs use masked rom which is as fast as dram (jon wtte). 6.0.7: single program usage base requirements: 1 mb and dd floppy, cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2mb and hd floppy. features a gui, cooperative-multitasker [multifinder], standard program interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. network receiving part of appleshare software is bundled with the os. has a 8mb ram barrier and is a 24-bit os. some third party products allow 14mb of virtual memory as long as real ram is below 8mb. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8l: system 6 for some macs that require system 7.0.x. 7.0.x: base requirements: 2mb, 40mb hard drive, and 68000; de-facto standard to run all features well: 4mb, 80mb hard drive, and 68030 {lowest present non-portable mac configuration}. using up to 10.08mb {this is everything on system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking within and between computers [iac], built-in server capabilities {filesharing can be used by older oses using appleshare client software and can be accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, iac requires 7.x}, virtual memory in machines with mmu{1.6 times real ram for least noticeable iisi speed degradation}, drag and drop, quicktime & built-in truetype support. supports sound input [aiff and snd formats] for most present machines. can access up to 1gb of true ram and 4gb of virtual memory and is both a 24 and 32-bit os. to use real ram beyond 8mb it must be in 32-bit mode and on older machines requires the 'mode 32' extension. apple's last 'free' os. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with worldscript support, speedier, and less ram usage than 7.0.dot (macweek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; pc week 9/7/92). to run in 32-bit mode on older machines it requires the 'mode 32' or '32-bit enabler' extension. marks the start of apple saling its mac os instead of allowing free upgrades {bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.x upgrades, $99 otherwise}. [the installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system file. this can eat up any ram benefits and cause other problems. apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system file.] a/ux 3.0 [unix]: needs 8mb ram {12-20mb suggested}, 160mb hard drive, and a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run. this 32-bit preemptive multitasking os is large due to being unix and needing translators between it and the mac roms. price: $709. note: sound output was supported in oses 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats including the following: snd, wave, asnd, fssd, qssn, smsd, soun, dc2d, and dcfl. in 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' and aiff which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most still play. ibm machiness have little gui code, data, and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the os. since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram. in addition, what little rom code there is also read into ram {a process called shadow rom} this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or eproms. having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the 'patches' needed. in addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed. side note: the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside ms and designing its windows and dos apps to fail under os/2 ("undocumented windows") and "there is deliberate code in [windows] nt beta which causes the install to abort if os/2 boot manager is present" (gregory hicks, info-ibmpc digest v92 #201). due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc judicial council for action against microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action. rumors-the ftc will presue the matter, likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council. in addition the government has turned down microsoft's copyright of "windows" which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks (pc week 03/08/93). microsoft oses dos 5.0: has a 640k barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 mb barrier with third party memory managers. this 16-bit os requires that each program must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {programs need to be dos protected mode interface (dpmi) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit protected mode] to break these barriers}. contains the gui shell present in dos 4.0. dos 6.0: dos 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk defragmenter, debugger for the config.sys file. it needs a $80 module for networking {cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} (byte april 1993:44-46). dos 7.0: 32-bit dos. in development (pc week 04/05/93). window 3.0: runs on top of dos. breaks 640k and 1m barriers but still has to deal with dos file structure. base requirements: 1mb, floppy and 286; to run well 2mb, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}. has the equivalent of mac's qd called windows gdi [graphics device interface]. this does not have a consistent application interface {like early mac programs (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to dos} and still tends to slow the machine down (info-ibmpc digest v92 #186) with speed is more dependent on the display adapter then on the cpu (bill coleman). window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their dos counterparts (byte april 1993:98-108). window 3.1: a faster version of window 3.0 with better memory managment. base requirements 1 mb, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2mb, hard drive, 386sx. apple plans to release its print drivers for this (pc week 12/28/92). windows for workgroups: to run well: 4mb ram and 386dx (pc world feb/93:160). intermediary between win 3.1 and windows nt. it is basically windows 3.1 with built-in peer to peer networking support. windows nt: beta release takes about 50mb of disk space [including the swap file], and 12mb ram {betas are notorious for ram usage especially in the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the reports of 24mb requirements}. released version supposed to need 8mb ram but, gates himself now recommends 16mb ram (pc week 04/15/92). this 32-bit os has protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit gdi. has built in networking that is osf dce compliant and can handle up to 4gb of ram. even though some people see a july 4 release date (infoworld nov 16/92), rumor is that the final version will not be available before oct 1993 (infoworld may 25/92; july 6/92; vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993 (pc week 09/28/92). windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495 (pc week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). other oses pc-dos 6.0: ibm's version of dos 6.0. it runs windows much faster then dos 6.0 due to faster file i/o and video handling (infoworld feb 1, 93). dr dos 6.0: same as dos 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} and memory management enhancements. still has 640k/1mb barrier. a later version {novell dos} of this may use a version of the mac finder and apple file management system (pc week 12/14/92; infoworld dec 14/92). os/2 2.0: unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16mb ram, 60mb {uses 17-33mb} hard drive, and 386dx cpu. this 32-bit multithreaded, multitasking os can address up to 4gb of ram but has to use a fast swap file to use more than 16 mb ram on isa systems using dma {direct memory access}. ibm plans to use taligent's oops in future versions of this (infoworld oct 26/92). aix: ibm's unix system, planned to be a subset of poweropen and taligent os. nextstep: gui unix to provide next features on ibm machines. beta out, final version to be out by may 25, 1993. solaris os for x86: a sunsoft port. a 32-bit os with symmetric multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and communication package. client: $795, 50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users server: $5,995. developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. mac 7.1 [working name: star trek]: apple had system 7.0 running off intel chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for ibm (computerworld nov 2/92; macweek 03/22/93). at present this is planned to run on top of novell's dr dos, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps will need to be recompiled (macweek 03/22/93). viewed as novell's answer to windows nt. the complexity of pc hardware set ups is one reason for slow progress {this seems to apple/ibm's way of leading to the powerpc line out in late 1993/early 1994 and pink os in late 1994-early 1995.} powerpc rumor-ibm will build its powerpc 601 by late 1993 (infoworld june 8 & 15, 92; macweek 7/13/92; pc week 3/15/93). it will have microchannel bus and xga video (carl b jabido), and will run native version aix and mac apps (pc week 3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of dos or windows apps. apple's powerpc 601 machine {tesseract} is planned to be out jan 24, 1994 and to have mc98601/50 mhz, 4/8mb ram, a 2.8-mbyte floppy drive and expected to sale near lc line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (macuser 9/92:146)} (macweek 3/22/93). poweropen [a/ux 4.0]: a 32-bit preemtive multitasking os planned to run on powerpcs and 68030/40 macs (macweek 7/13/92). intel compatibility uncertain (see mac 7.1 above). planned base requirements: 68030, 8mb ram, 80mb hard drive (macweek 4/19/93). rumor-ahead of schedule; could be out by mid 1993. rumor-this could be the os for ibm's powerpc 601 which is due by late 1993. pink [taligent os]: expecting delivery in 1994 (wall street journal 1/12/92) and may have some parts shipping in os/2 and aix in 1993 and mac os and poweropen with the powerpcs (macweek 01/25/93). windows nt: possible port (macweek 04/05/93). see ibm os section for details. solaris os: version of this sun microsystems inc unix os to run on the power pcs in 1994 (macweek 04/05/93). one of the few oses to directly state that it will run windows/dos programs. ibm os section for details nextstep: possible port see ibm os section for details. os number crunching (mel park) mac arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {sane or standard apple numerics environment}. floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an fpu is present and 80 bits otherwise. exceptions, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal representation for infinity (inf). 1/(1/0) produces zero. the above treatment of 1/(1/0) occurs in an fpu-equipped machine even when sane is bypassed and the fpu programmed directly. ibm floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware fpu, 64-bits when emulated. the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program. on older dos complilers exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the dos prompt at the point where they occured. most present compilers handle this better. result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between dos, windows and os/2 programs nor between programs for just one os. networking [includes printing] wysiwyg printing can be a problem with either mac of ibm machines especially if one sends truetype fonts to a older style postscript printer. mac hardware: built-in localtalk network port and a built-in printer port. localtalk has moderate speeds (230.4 kb/s) requires special connectors for each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}. built-in ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at about $150-$300 for each machine. these cards provide three connectors and transceivers {thick, thin, and 10baset} for ethernet. the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. tokenring has been a network option since 1989. software: appletalk {the suite of protocols} standard with mac os, which can use variety of media types. appleshare client software included with the os as well and can connect to file servers such as novell netware, 3com 3+open, banyan vines, dec pathworks, apple's appleshare servers, system 7 file sharing machines, and afp servers running on variety of unix hosts. mactcp allows typical tcp/ip communications (telnet, ftp, nfs, rlogin). a later version will have unix x/open transport interface (xti) built-in by the end of 1993 (macweek 04/12/93). third-party software to connect to nfs servers. dec pathworks provides decnet support. peer-to-peer file sharing software built-in to system 7.1 (see os section). full server software is extra. printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser. changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser. the same is true of connecting to servers. printing bugs: monaco truetype font is different then the screen bitmap font. {quickdraw qx is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.} ibm hardware: localtalk [not widely used], ethernet, and tokenring. software: novell netware, banyan vines, decnet, windows/work groups, appletalk protocols, and appleshare {subset of appletalk}. each of the ms-dos networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible with the others. once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on. windows/work groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem. novell netware is the biggest, {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and offers better control/management/security than appleshare, but it's also more complex to set up and manage. this will change due to the use of the mac finder and file management system by novell. (pc week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92; infoworld dec 14/92; macweek 3/22/93) printing {very os dependent} dos: if it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, and don't worry about it {tweeking may be needed with poorly written software}. network printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one software program to the next. windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs" in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they are not. this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now. windows for workgroups is more mac-like and intelligent about this. os/2: mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the os. printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do not have wysiwyg printing. this is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the os involved. price issue: this is very dynamic with mac providing more build-in features than ibm and ibm being more 'get only what you need' then mac and price wars by both worlds. the ibm machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization, which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to handle all the variation in hardware. when one adds all the standard mac hardware features to an ibm {built-in input/output sound support, scsi, pds, built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and nubus 90 in higher machines} the mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted ibm machine {especially since some ibm monitors can be used with macs which cuts some more of the mac's cost (macuser aug 1992:158-176)}. some prices using some of the info in this sheet and macuser april 1993. all macs below come with a pds slot, vram, and scsi-1 built in. except where noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card needed except for 24-bit color display}. ibm planned a $1,200 386slc/25mhz model with a 60mb hard drive and color vga monitor {~vram} (macweek 8/17/92) {sounds like a color classic without scsi-1, sound support, built-in network support, fpu socket, built-in expansion to 16-bit color, etc}. color classic: $1,389 - 030/16mhz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20mhz equivalent}, 4/80, fpu socket, and built-in monitor. lciii: $1,499 - 030/25mhz {~386dx/33mhz equivalent}, and 4/160. centris 610: $2,899 - 68lc040/20mhz {depending on the program ~486sx/40 or ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]mhz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i cd-rom, a pds/nubus 90 slot and vram for 16-bit color. centris 650: 040/25mhz {depending on the program ~486dx/50 mhz or 486dx2/50 mhz equivalent} with a pds and 3 nubus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, cd-rom, vram for 16-bit color} bibliography notes 'vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by ftp on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by murphy sewall {last issue: april 93.} 'info-ibmpc digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in directory pd2:<archives.ibmpc> 'dictionary of computer terms 3rd ed.'

the logitech scanman 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. note that its effective resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. if you don't intend to magnify a graphic, it works fine. a true 256 level gray scanner would work better for images. i've seen the scanman go for as little as $100 used. it is a reasonable buy at that price. higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used flat bed scanners. here is seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains in the classifieds. used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately. grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350.

after reading reports from germany of success in accelerating a quadra or centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, i decided to test the claim. i pulled out my variable speed overdrive and the motherboard's 50 mhz clock chip. i put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a 64 mhz ttl clock oscillator i had left over from working on some si's. i can't believe it. it actually works. i'm not getting scsi timing errors either. this is only after a short run time but i'll keep posting results. did i spend all that money on the vso for nothing? if this keeps working, the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort. guy kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

the si has a single expansion slot, that can be either pds or nubus, but not both together. the card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & hd and requires an adaptor slot to do this. there are nubus and pds adaptort cards. thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you have. with the exception of the radius rocket, all nubus cards i know of work in the si. pds slots and thus cards are mac specific, thus not all pds cards work in all macs. **** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in **** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views.

hello. i have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). is there a difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus any other mac, say plus or ii?? i have heard, though not confirmed by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds. i also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem allowing speeds just as any other serial port. my particular use is that i have a 6811 evb board that i need to interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses. i set everything up just as in lab and nothing. in fact, the powerbook locks up. can anyone help, inform, advise? i would appreciate it. i would prefer email since i don't read the news at all. i will post a summary if enough response is generated. thanks. faisal m. bhamani faceman@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu ps. if this topic has been discussed already, please excuse me and direct me to the appropriate places. thanks.

> can some people with cache cards please post speedometer numbers they > get with the cards. i have only one report, which seems to indicate > that a 32k cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! ok. i have a record that shows a iisi with and without a 64kb cache. it's small enough that i will attach it. i have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 kb cache. the speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%. i think an average of 20%-25% is about right. the subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable. a simple cache card certainly does not transform a iisi into something enormously better. i do not have an fpu. the conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32k and 64k caches. i bought mine from third wave for well under $150. i have had absolutely no problems at all with it. if you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32k cache, i'd like to see them. let's check the conventional wisdom! the so called "performance rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest. cheers.

i'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase. i'm primarily looking at 128mb drives, although i might consider 256mb ones. when looking through macworld and macuser ads, the prices for the 128mb drives seem to range from just under $1000 (for the dgr 128rem portable, magic 128mb portable fujitsu, or nudesign 128mb from macdirect) to about $1600 (for the fwb hammerdisk 130 and mass microsystems datapak mo/128). different drives use different mechanisms - most, fujitsu, sony, epson, probably some others. my problem is that after reading the nov 92 macworld and apr 93 macuser reviews of these drives, i'm still not sure what to get. so, i'm asking if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128mb m-o drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or anything else i should probably know. thanks. 	john sasinowski

i guess the real question is: who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_. are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing btw) isolated from every other factor and influence in the system? or are we shopping for a home computer based on the cpu specs (yuck)! i just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has _a lot_ to do with the "power" of a cpu in a particular application. if what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given, then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick. if you have to fake things (like resolving indirection without a lea instruction), then your cycle count goes through the roof! well, let's _not_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose. the orginal question was about classifying micro-processors... having re-read the entire thread, i don't think much more can be said without getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given. that's it for another $0.02. cheers everyone. ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= peter pundy email: 2545500@jeff-lab.queensu.ca "i've got no witty wisdom to share, but have a nice day anyway." ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

hi, i have been told by a local sales that asante has come out with this lciii pds ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board. my question is will the fpu performance degrade will i put the 68882 on the pds card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? intuitively, the math co-processor should always be placed close to the cpu, but i am not sure how good apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when it comes to throughout. does anyone know the answer to this or have any experience with the asante lciii ethernet adapter? thanks in advance. andy -- andy sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca) 4 taddle creek road, toronto computing coordinator ontario, canada. m5s 1a4 department of industrial engineering phone: (416) 978-8830 university of toronto fax: (416) 978-3453

sorry, this must be a faq, but it's a quick fix that i need to take care of before a demo in less than 24 hours from now! couldn't think of a better place for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware. i need to connect the serial a of a compac 386/20 pc to the printer port of a mac iici. does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would allow this connection? the serial port on the compaq is a male db9. how would this map to the din8 of the mac serial? i tried one of those really short femaledb9-maledin8 cables that apple sold as adaptors to plug in macintosh serial peripherals from the pre-macplus era. this cable didn't do it. do i need a null modem adaptor as well on the db9 side of things? i just need to be able to map the data tx and rx pins correctly. thanks kindly, atau tanaka tanaka@ircam.fr
i have a mac plus with 2.5mb ram. i have just bought an extra 2mb so that i can have the max 4mb ram that a plus supports. however, i can't get it to boot after i install the 2 extra simms. instead i get a sad mac (sorry, but i can't remember the code). looking at the motherboard, i can see that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256kb path - 1 row". i assume that was done when the first 1mb simms were added. so, my question is: are there any other resistors that need snipping? 				or, do i have bum simms which need to be exchanged? any and all advice will be appreciated. chris gatenby gatenb@mrisun.med.yale.edu

i have a logitech 256grays hand scanner from a pc. i'm wondering if anyone has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac? it has the same connector and is a serial device on the pc. i can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed, but i'm not sure if the signal levels would be correct, and if the mac s/w would work with it. of course the manuals say nothing about the interface, connector layout or anything h/w-ish! any ideas?? thanx, steve

i purchased an lciii recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the logic board. i opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two other chips. i'd like to know more about it. could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it? thanks a bunch. 1.	what does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)? 2.	what are the technical details of the re-work? (i'm looking for 	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected, 	and the pin-outs for those chips.) 3.	is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without? 4.	could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of 	the operating system? 	and, finally, 5.	should i even be concerned about any of this? keith folsom folsom@cup.portal.com

(1.0) ==================== congratulations! you've come to the right place. usenet is a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions (how do i lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make steve jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror. (i used resedit to remove resources init #11, wdef 34, and nvir 17 from my system file and used the hex editor to add code string #a67b45 as a patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box would be a nice shade of mauve. everything worked fine until i installed supercdevblaster, and now when i use the aldus driver to print from pagemaker 5.0d4 to a linotronic 6000 my system hangs. p.s. i'm running system 6.0.2 on a powerbook 170.) since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups, and rtfm (read the friendly manual) before posting your question. we realize that you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen of your newly-installed twenty megs of ram, but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before, and it's developing tired feet. finally, before posting to any newsgroup (macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup news.announce.newusers. how do i use this document? where can i get it? (1.1) comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces, a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc. faq lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development. when ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup. all pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. except for this document itself which is named general-faq.z the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by "-faq", e.g. system-faq.z, misc-faq.z. the .z means the file is stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either maccompress, stuffit deluxe, or the unix uncompress command to decompress it. however if you leave off the ".z" extension when you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you. this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups. the tables of contents for each of the specific faq lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the faq even if you don't have the other parts at hand. it's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a particular question or comment should be posted. please familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them. which questions appear in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where. to jump to a particular question search for section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses. for example to find "where can i ftp macintosh software?" search for the string "(2.1)". to jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number. what other information is available? (1.2) comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system. four other files are worthy of particular note: daryl spitzer maintains a faq list covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.programmer. it's posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in /pub/mac. eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now is also irregularly archived). this list answers many frequently asked questions about networking, unix and the mac, telecommunications, and foreign file formats. norm walsh has compiled an excellent faq for comp.fonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform conversion and printing. it's available in comp.fonts or by ftp from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/faq*. finally jim jagielski maintains a faq for comp.unix.aux covering apple's unix environment, a/ux. it's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux and news.answers. it's available for anonymous ftp at jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov. which newsgroup should i post to? (1.3) there are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. you wouldn't ask your english teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one, would you? so don't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft word is in the background. ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse. if you want people to help you, you need to learn their ways of communicating. posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too :-) ). posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence. for instance the most common and glaring mispost, one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic, asking a question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm, normally produces no useful responses. posting the same question to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers. please post to exactly one newsgroup. do not cross-post. if a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. for the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a catch-all newsgroup. the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where. specifically questions about productivity applications (software you bought your macintosh to run, not software you bought to make your macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. communications programs, games, hypercard, compilers and databases all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups. post questions about non-communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to comp.sys.mac.hardware. questions about macos system software belong in comp.sys.mac.system. questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc. questions about a/ux go to comp.unix.aux. detailed questions about appletalk belong in comp.protocols.appletalk. direct questions about hypercard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. non-hypercard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer. resedit questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc, comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. a general exception to the above rules is that any very technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (recent example: how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages?) might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup. for sale and want to buy posts should go to comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac only. we understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128k mac to get the $$ for a powerbook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted. political and religious questions (the mac is better than windows! is not! is too! is not! is too! hey! how 'bout the amiga! what about it? is not! is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy. anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc. finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems. questions about mac midi are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a macintosh specific newsgroup. shop around. usenet's a big place and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in comp.sys.mac. 4. someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of their twenty megabytes of ram. shouldn't i put my brilliance and wit on display for the world by posting the seventeenth response? no. frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions. unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in system 7.1 could eat memory) private e-mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one. you might want to add a mention of this faq in your e-mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions. i do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that lets me send pwfaq's (people with frequently asked questions) the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can't be troubled to read the faq list to get it. === ftp (2.0) === where can i ftp mac software? (2.1) the three major north american internet archives of shareware, freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several others. wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu. rascal was notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the less efficient binhex format common at the other archives. unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites. to keep traffic on the internet manageable, scandinavians should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead. those in the u.k. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). continental europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40), ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive. japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp (130.69.254.254). a fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). this is apple's semi-official repository for system software, developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things that come more or less straight from apple's mouth. some material at this site may not be distributed outside the u.s. or by other sites that don't have an official license to distribute apple system software. please read the various readme documents available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're connecting from outside the u.s. or if you wish to redistribute material you find here. can i get shareware by e-mail? (2.2) the info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by e-mail from listserv@ricevm1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). the listserver responds to the commands $macarch help, $macarch index, and $macarch get filename. mac archive files are available from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu. send it a message containing the words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request. you can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. for details send it a message with just the text "help" (no quotes). where can i find application x? (2.3) if you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an e-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help." archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15, america), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server in canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, australia), archie.funet.fi (128.214.6.100, scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7, the u.k. and the continent). these sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp. login as "archie" (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions. for instance you would type "prog disinfectant" to search for a convenient ftp site for disinfectant. if the initial search fails to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of the name. for instance if you didn't find disinfectant with "prog disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead. substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross. to avoid many erroneous matches add a ".*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g. "prog disi.*\.hqx" most mac software available on the net ends in .hqx but almost no unix or pc software does. please check the above archives and archie personally before asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware. if you follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software. can someone mail me application x? (2.4) no. nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site. please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous ftp, archie, and automatic e-mail servers. what is .bin? .hqx? .cpt? .etc? (2.5) most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems. first they're compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or macbinary (.bin) format that other computers can digest. (the macintosh uses a special two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.) binhex files are 7-bit ascii text files, while macbinary files are pure 8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol. how a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix. normally a file will have a name something like filename.xxx.yyy. .xxx indicates how it was compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated. to use a file you've ftp'd and downloaded to your mac you'll need to reverse the process. most files you get from the net require a two-step decoding process. first change the binhex (.hqx) or macbinary (.bin) file to a double-clickable macintosh file; then decompress it. which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below. also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh files as they are downloaded. *************************************************************************** suffix: .sit .cpt .hqx .bin .pit .z .image .dd .zip .uu .tar extractors -------------------------------------------------------------------------- stuffit 3.0| x x x x x compact pro| x x packit | x uutool | x maccompress| x suntar | x x x x binhex 5.0 | x binhex 4.0 | x diskdoubler| x x unzip | x diskcopy | x macutil | x x x x *************************************************************************** a few notes on the decompressors: stuffit is a family of products that use several different compression schemes. the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff all of them. versions of stuffit earlier than 3.0 (stuffit 1.5.1, stuffit classic, unstuffit, and stuffit deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit 3.0. you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit expander. stuffit 3.0.5 (lite and deluxe) consistently makes smaller archives than any other macintosh compression utility. to allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with stuffit 3.0.5. uutool, maccompress, and suntar handle the popular unix formats of uuencode (.uu), compress (.z), and tar (.tar) respectively. the unix versions are often more robust than the mac products, so use them instead when that's an option. translators that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp. macutil is dik winter's package of unix utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a mac. since unix stores files differently than does the mac, macutil creates macbinary (.bin) files which should be automatically converted on download. it can't decompress everything. in particular it can't decompress the new stuffit 3.0 archives. :-( however, if you need only one or two files out of an archive--for instance if you want to read the readme to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it--macutil is indispensable. it can be found at sumex-aim in the info-mac/unix directory. a few notes on the compression formats: .bin: these are macbinary files. always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them, never ascii or text. most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead. only rascal stores most of its files in .bin format. most communications programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they'll be downloading macbinary files. .image: this format is normally used only for system software, so that on-line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies. instead of using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use steve christensen's freeware utility mountimage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. mountimage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case. .sea (.x, .x): .sea files don't merit a position in the above table because they're self-extracting. they may have been created with compact pro, stuffit, or even diskdoubler; but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked. for some unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self-extracting archives created with their payware products superdisk! and more disk space. instead they append either .x or .x to self-extracting archives. how can i get binhex? stuffit? etc.? (2.6) by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you. if you're at a university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than mcmurdo sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center, dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit. once you have stuffit (any version) you don't need binhex. if you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy of stuffit from a local bulletin board system. if you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp, then i suppose i'll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by far the hardest way to get it. ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and login. type the word "binary." hit return. type "cd mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return. then "get stuffit_expander_1.0.1_sea_bin" and hit return. of course it's always possible that by the time you read this stuffit expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar. if you've ftp'd straight onto your mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a working copy of stuffit expander when double-clicked. if you've ftp'd to your mainframe or unix account first, you still need to use a modem program to download it to your mac. just make sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode. if you need more details on the last step, consult the faq list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software. how can i get binhex, stuffit, etc. from a pc? (2.7) you can't. there is absolutely no way to get an executable macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp. you must beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as binhex or stuffit lite from another person. i realize this may terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement since you got an apple ii+ in 1980, but eventually you're going to need to link up with some human being other than your mother. (though i suppose if you're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you.) while you're gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question again. there simply is no way to move executable macintosh programs from a pc or other non-macintosh computer onto a mac without software that is not bundled with most macs. ================================================================= troubleshooting: what to do (before posting) when things go wrong (3.0) ================================================================= while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help. you should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine described in section four, especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system heap (4.5). following these steps may or may not solve your problem, but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to you. identify the problem. (3.1) "microsoft word is crashing" doesn't say much. what were you doing when it crashed? can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash? the more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. the more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions preceding it (step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem. for example, "sometimes quarkxpress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is not nearly as helpful as "quarkxpress 3.0 crashes when i link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text." the former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step. the latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it's still there or not. read the read me file. (3.2) many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their read me files. often these aren't documented in the manual. read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound familiar. check for viruses. (3.3) run disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk. virus infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do. reinstall the application and all its support files. (3.4) for half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields, improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain. this can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior. restoring from original masters will normally fix this. reinstall the system software. (3.5) bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. see question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a clean reinstall. if the problem continues to occur after you've taken these steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program. so it's time to isolate the problem. (3.6) you need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself. here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash: a.	run only one application at a time. occasionally applications do conflict with each other. if the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the crash. b.	if you're running system 6, turn off multifinder. if you're running system 7, allot as much memory to the application as you can afford. sometimes programs just need more memory, especially when performing complicated operations. c. if you're running system 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit addressing. there's still an awful lot of system 7 hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no excuse. (can you say microsoft word 5.1, boys and girls? i knew you could.) some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken. d.	boot from a virgin system floppy. if the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict. you need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes. use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove. if the problem occurs when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first. if the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated, either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time. once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back. continue until you've narrowed the conflict down to one extension. when you think you've found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem. contact technical support. (3.7) by now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why the conflict occurs. if a tech support number is available for the software, call it. if you're lucky the company will have a work around or fix available. if not, perhaps they'll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release. ====================== preventive maintenance (4.0) ====================== you wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a tune-up. a computer is no different. regular tune-ups avoid a lot of problems. although there are mac mechanics who'll be happy to charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's no reason you can't change it yourself. the following nine-step program should be performed about every three months. trash unneeded files (4.1) many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk. if you're at all like me, you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have, archives of software you've dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need. if you're running system 7 you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone. throw them away and empty the trash. rethink your extensions (4.2) some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection. if you don't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. for instance if you only read pc disks once a month, there's no need to keep accesspc loaded all the time. cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes. rebuild the desktop (4.3) the desktop file/database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it. it lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where. depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file. as applications and files move on and off your hard disk, the desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt. think of it as a congress for your mac. every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate. fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent. one warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you've stored in the get info boxes. under system 7 maurice volaski's freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild. commentkeeper also works with system 6 but only if apple's desktop manager extension is also installed. to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and, as your extensions finish loading, depress the command and option keys. you'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that "this could take a few minutes." click ok. it will take more than a few minutes. the more files you have the longer it will take. if you're running system 6 you may want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop. if you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance, you may want to use fifth generation's freeware init desktop reset. desktop reset completely deletes the desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures. zap the pram and reset the clock (4.4) all macs from the original 128k thin mac to the quadra 950 contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from. unfortunately this "parameter ram" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes. to reset it under system 7 hold down the command, option, p, and r keys while restarting your mac. under system 6 hold down the command, option, and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the apple menu. click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter ram. since you've erased almost all the settings in the general control panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want. the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the date and time; but since the internal clock in the macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway. resize the system heap (4.5) even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart. all these extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of memory called the system heap. if the system heap isn't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it, they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap, knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off. all this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the mac. if you're using system 7, your macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running system 6 it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications. by default this size is set to 128k, way too small for most macs with any extensions at all. the system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot blocks of every system disk. bill steinberg's freeware utility bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated. if you're running system 6, get bootman, use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes. reinstall the system software (4.6) system files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. merely updating the system software will often not fix system file corruption. i recommend doing a clean reinstall. here's how: 1. boot from the installer floppy of your system disks. 2. copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out of your system file into a temporary suitcase. 3. trash the system file on your hard disk. also trash the finder, multifinder, da handler, and all other standard apple extensions like control panel and chooser. these will all be replaced in the new installation. if you're running or installing system 7, move everything in the extensions, control panels, and preferences folders into the top level of the system folder. 4. rename the system folder. any name other than system folder is fine. 5. double-click the installer script on your system disk. then choose customize... select the appropriate software for your model mac and printer. you could do an easy install instead, but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't need that waste your memory and disk space. 6. once installation is finished, move everything from the temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new system folder. if you're asked if you want to replace anything, you forgot to take something out in step 3. you'll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate piece. 7. reinstall any fonts or da's you removed in step 2. 8. reboot. you should now have a clean, defragmented system file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall. disk utilities (4.7) much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss. apple includes disk first aid, a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its system disks. it's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in the directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc. even if you have an earlier version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com and run it on all your hard disks. several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything that disk first aid does. the three most effective for general work are central point's mactools deluxe 2.0, fifth generation's public utilites, and symantec's norton utilities for the macintosh 2.0. a department or work group should have all of these as well as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do. for individuals mactools ($48 street) is about half the price of norton ($94 street) or public utilities ($98 street) so, features and ease of use being roughly equal, i recommend mactools. all of these products occasionally encounter problems they can't fix. when that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and reformat (4.9). backing up (4.8) this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a lot more often than every three months. the simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media. if you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it's easy to only back up those folders which change frequently. nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk. a number of programs are available to make backing up easier. apple included a very basic full backup application with system 6. with the performas apple ships a new apple backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder onto floppies. the previously mentioned norton utilities for the mac and mactools deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups. finally if you're lucky enough to have a tape drive, network server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should check out the more powerful payware utilities redux ($49 street, doesn't support tape drives) and diskfit pro ($74 street). there are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd backup from system 6. disk defragmentation (4.9) as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files. therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk. as files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade. there are several ways to defragment a hard disk. the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while you're at it. see question 4.10.), and restore all the files. a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e. without erasing it. although the ads for all these products brag about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong. there are no freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the net by asking for one. reformat your hard disk (4.10) just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data. you don't need to reformat every three months; but when your system is crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean. reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space. not all hard disks are created equal. some can hold more data than others. to facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3 megabytes is the average formatted capacity. your mileage may vary.) apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity. when you reformat there's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space apple's left on your disk. unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them. most hard disks come with formatting software. apple's disks and system software ship with hd sc setup, a minimal disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only. most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives. normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk. a number of general-purpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk access, system 7 compatibility, and even compression. two of the best are the payware drive7 and hard disk toolkit personal edition ($49 street for either). while there are one or two freeware formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk. powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use. otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and data losses are a very good possibility. elliotte rusty harold department of mathematics elharo@shiva.njit.edu new jersey institute of technology erh0362@tesla.njit.edu newark, nj 07102

several weeks ago, i described a problem with my apple high-resolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. to recapitulate: occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor momentarily loses sync. the entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. this usually happens right after i close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that radically alters the image on the screen. sometimes, though, it happens with no provocation whatsoever. i have received a bewildering range of replies. at one extreme was a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the problem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's power supply. there was no fix available, he said, because nothing was really wrong. (i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured.) this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the apple service technical procedures, volume 3, under the heading jitter correction. the section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that, the swap of a circuit board. i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing.

a local dealer is offering mac ii vi machines equipped with kodak multi- session compatible cd-rom drives for what seems like an attractive price: $1500. i've used many other models up to a ii ci, but this would be the first i could have my own mac. is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued model such as this. i'd like to yank the cd-rom drive out, put it in a housing and share it with my pc. is this feasible? the only info i have on the ii vi is that it is relatively slow (16mhz), has an 68030 chip with a math coprocessor. i want to add a non-apple portrait monitor and use this machine for hypercard stack design. is this a good buy, or would i be wasting my money? i would appreciate some advice. thanks! robert matthews grfg128@twnmoe10.bitnet.edu.tw (taiwan)
re: methods for attaching heat sink to processor. go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. it comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap. at radio shack, it's catalog number 276-1372. it's a mix of silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well. plus, it's tacky. usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your mac, gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place. just make sure you remember it's in there, in case you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose. you wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac.

(it's too slow.) why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? if you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using sndplay. instead, make a channel and use buffercmds to play sounds on it. it works great. you can add callbacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty. before it gets empty. > >the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager. unfortunately, >system 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally. > >>the moral of the story is to developers: don't cheat! > >well, i want my code to work on old systems too. i don't know about sys 7.1, >but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the sound manager that causes >channels to hang (with no error message). this happends when i keep a >channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many >sounds, stopping sounds halfway. callbacks seems not to be reliable. >then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to >inspect private variables in the channel (qhead, i think it was), and the >only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an >*undocumented* flag and modify it. callbacks are very reliable, i found them 100% reliable, even under system 4.1. i was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on system 6.0 with the im-v documentation. you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. in general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. this might be because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. you need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. you'll probably want to switch to buffercmd's, since you are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks. now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, spectre uses it. and it works great. if spectre can spare the cpu time, you can too. one little disclaimer: there are some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi can't be made to work right. i'm not sure either way, but i know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the sound manager. -steve
here's another question by a hesitant powerbook purchaser. i want to be able to run mathematica and would like to hear some comments from the gallery about this. how much slower does the program run on a machine without an fpu (namely a pb160) versus a machine with an fpu (namely a pb170). what types of calculations get bogged down the most. i primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. i don't do a lot of numerical work. would a pb160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice video port ) be sufficient or should i really try to get an fpu for this type of work? is a pb170 with 8mb faster than a pb160 with 12 or 16mb. all comments appreciated. please respond by email: ross@sbphy.physics.ucsb.edu

i posted on here about a problem with a datadesk 101e keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key. after absolutely no help from datadesk i called macconnection tech support. they tried it out on their centris 610 and had the same problem. they immediately offered to get a new keyboard, try it on their centris and ship it to me overnight if it worked. i could send them my keyboard back after i got the one that worked. this is from a guy in tech support named dave. it turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option. i really like this keyboard so i was glad to be able to keep it. on the other hand, datadesks tech support sucks while macconnection's is great! -terry

repost - due to net problems hi, i have problems with the fdhd on a iicx that ekg reports is rom revision 376. i had reports that this mac was having trouble formatting disks and by the time i got to it, the fdhd just would not respond although all other functions were fine. i checked the voltages on the db19 external drive connector and pin 6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. the power supply is an astec and i sent it away for repair. with the power supply reinstalled, i now get the following error: with the internal fdhd connected, the mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays "the disk is unreadable - do you want to eject it?". for every combination of response, the alert reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. the fdhd does spin but there is no head seeking and the fdhd is incapable of ejecting the disk. this error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or not. pin 6 on the db19 external connector shows 1.2v, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75v. with the internal fdhd disconnected, the mac boots fine and works great (macekg reports no errors). the db19 external connector now shows no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75v. now, the internal fdhd may be fubar, but i have an apple 800k external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external db19 or the internal connector at j16 (after suitable surgery to the external drive). the voltages at j16 (with the internal fdhd disconnected) are as follows: 	pin	volts	pin	volts 	1	-	2	5 	3	-	4	5 	5	-	6	5 	7	-	8	- 	9	-	10	5 	11	-	12	- 	13	10.75	14	5 	15	10.75	16	5 	17	10.75	18	- 	19	10.75	20	5 this machine has a swim which i don't think ekg tests. i have tested all diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. does anybody have any ideas ? best wishes, woody. paul woodman praxis plc, \ / | the software engineering company of touche ross, \ / ___ ___ _| 20 manvers street, bath, ba1 1px, uk. \ /\ / / / / / / | \ / tel +44 225 444700 xt228 \/ \/ /__/ /__/ /__| \/ fax +44 225 465205. _________________________/ woody@praxis.co.uk

hello! i have a se/30 and a generation systems 8bit pds card for a 17" screen. it worked great until i upgraded from 5 to 20 mb ram. now with sys7.1 and mode32 or 32enabler it does not boot.. a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit fixes. but: when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor goes black after having been grey) the system sometimes boots properly!! and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics. what's happening??? thanks a lot for any advice!!! please answer by mail. ossip kaehr ossip@cs.tu-berlin.de voice: +49.30.6226317 -- __ -------------------------------------------------------------- __ /_/\ ossip kaehr	hermannstrasse 32 d-1000 berlin 44 germany /\_\ \_\/ tel. +49.30.6223910 or 6218814 email ossip@cs.tu-berlin.de \/_/ --------------------------------------------------------------

> yes, i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on. but what about > monitors? they generate a lots of heat. should i or shouldn't i keep them on > 24 hours a day? any advice? thanks. take care...paul there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement. true, there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but the internal power supply is well-protected. (i've turned my mac on and off six or seven times a day for three years without problem). the monitor is the same. to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much as a television, possibly more. turn it off when you're not using it. it'll save you money and the world a few more resources. -kelley- -- ----------------------------------------------------------------- thomas kelley boylan, powerpc, ibm austin, kelleyb@austin.ibm.com ----------------------------------------------------------------- i buy and pay for my own opinions
hello, i saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as i could tell no answer appeared on the net. what is the good oil on connecting the apple extended keyboard to a powerbook? the earlier questioner wonderd if this would be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i am curious. i haven't got a pb yet so i can't rtfm but i assume that a standard keyboard with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet i read mentioned connecting an external keyboard. but is the extended plus mouse pushing it? any help gratefully recieved. i will summarise to the net if necessary. thanks, john collins. p.s. i am thinking of a pb160 but i assume that this would apply to all pb's.

add me to the list of bugged 230 owners. i had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when i first got it, both with and without the techworks ram. finally it "died", wouldn't start, until i opened the docking door (which snaps open) and the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off. apple replaced the processor board. now, twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action) twice the machine has refused to wake up. acutally, the backlighting came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in (but not with a good battery). the first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery for ~1 minute brought the machine back. the second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until powered down for about 30 minutes. the screen had what looked like red horizontal lines accross it. both timse the file "fax modem preferences" has been corrupted according to disinfectent). i have removed all the fax and modem software, and the third party memory, and am waiting to see if it happens again. forrest -- forrest howard oracle corporation 500 oracle parkway box 65414 redwood shores, ca 94065

hello net.people, we have a laserwriter select 310 (standard 1.5mb ram) connected to an lc iii (4/80). the print driver cannot find any adobe type 1 fonts or any truetype fonts in the system. the connections to the printer and the driver installation are correct but this 310 printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out of the box. imho, an apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event. the installer disks for the printer install: lw select 310 driver v 1.0, printmonitor v 7.1 and backgrounder v 3.1 (!) on a system 7.1 lc iii. has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer/configuration, because we really need some help on this one. thanks, anthony anthony@medicine.adelaide.edu.au
here is how i modified my quadra 700 for higher speed. previously i had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds. your mileage may vary. the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. my personal q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. i didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds. parts 	clock oscillators (4 pin ttl variety) you will need a selection of 	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. the cpu will run at 1/2 the 	oscillator speed. the original one is a 50 mhz unit. i recommend 	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one. 	 i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 1-800-344-4539 for 	 less than $5.00 each. some of their part numbers are: 		 50 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part # x121) 		 62 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part # x136) 		 66 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part # ctx137) 	 don't get the half size clock oscillators. they won't fit. 	 there are also cmos clock oscillators. i haven't tried one in a 	 quadra. (they work fine in iisi's) 	 	socket: obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as 	 a 14 pin dip package. alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins 	 from an augat style socket. just cut them out of the socket. 	cooling fan: a very small 12 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a 	 must. my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had 	 a fan built onto it. it had a pass-through connector which 	 tapped into the hard drive power cable. you should rig up 	 something similar or risk frying your cpu. 	 procedure 1) insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here. 2) remove the top lid of the machine. you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this. unplug all cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from 	the back of the mac. 3) remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up. the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply. leave that alone. the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release. 4) look at the rear of the tower assembly. you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive. disconnect all these from the motherboard. the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it. 5) unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount 6) look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. a phillips head screw is at the base. remove it, taking care not to drop it into the case. a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here. 7) remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower. this tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. 8) remove the interrupt switch assembly. it is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. pull the middle, 	rear plastic prong up and forward. the entire device will release. 	 9) unplug the speaker cable. squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case. 	 10) remove the motherboard form the case. lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm. this allows it to clear the clear plastic 	power light guide. slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. the 	motherboard then comes directly out. 	 11) locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. it is a small metal box near the cpu chip. note and remember its orientation. the new clock oscillators 	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation. 	 	very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. some of 	the pins may be bent over. simply desolder then unbend them. be sure 	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board. 	 	i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. this is 	not appropriate for a first soldering experience. the motherboard is 	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without 	proper care. 	 12) install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was. 13) put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. you could use the 	old clock but it has solder on its pins. this may come of inside the 	socket and cause corrosion problems later. i suggest using a new 	50 mhz clock. 	 14) install your cooling fan system to complete the modification. 	 14) reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place. 15) snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly. plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard. 	 16) reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case. once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place. 	 17) reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. dont't forget the floppy drive cable. 18) replace the phillips head screw 19) drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. 20) plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount. 21) reattach your cables and power cords. cross your fingers and turn on the mac. it should make the usual power on chord. if it doesn't, 	something is amiss. immediately turn of the power and recheck your 	handiwork. if all is not well, you have my sincere condolences. 	 	hopefully, all will work normally. turn the machine back off and 	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. reboot and 	be astounded. 	 	you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding 	a particular speed is truly usable. with my vso, a machine lock-up 	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. in the brief time since 	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) i have not had a single 	problem. 	 good luck to all who attempt this modification. there is a small but real risk, but you could well reach quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $50 in parts. guy kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their iisi clock oscillator. i have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. the number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with. thanks to all who contributed to this poll. issues: 	speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without 		add on cards. all reported machines were able to use 		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. several apple 		nubus cards were in use. no machine with the nubus adapter 		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. one wasn't even able to 		achieve 25 mhz with the nubus adapter in place 	 		at speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and 		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported. 		 		note: unless specifically listed below, machines were not 			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. hence, 			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at 			higher speeds. 			 	damage) one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. this was 		repaired and the machine is operational. one other 		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator 		during desoldering. there is one second hand report of a user 		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. 		 		no reports of static discharge damage. 		 		no reports of high speed operation causing damage. 		 		then again, i also don't have any reports from users of 		defective parachutes. 		 	add on boards) compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus 		adapters. several other add on boards have been used with 		success. see case histories 		 	heat sinks) virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. 		these were often the to-220 style power transistor type. some 		used epoxy. some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab 		of cyanoacrylate glue. there was also use of a clamp with a 		bolt through the hole in the motherboard. 		 		 		 case histories:	 all speeds are the effective cpu speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). all reported cpu versions were 20 mhz. 1) 27.5 mhz operational. ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing. no fpu or other add on card heatsinked cpu only on 24 hours/day no damage during installation 2) 27.5 mhz operational without apple nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with 	apple nubus card installed heatsinked cpu only on 24 hours/day no floppy problems no damage during installation 3) 27.5 mhz operational. unable to boot at 31 mhz heatsinked cpu only no floppy problems no damage during installation 4) 25 mhz operational works with the following two configurations 	 	 	a)	realtech fpu adaptor card 			realtech cache card 			supermac 8*24 pdqsi 		 		b) 	supermac fpu adaptor card 			supermac video spigot 			supermac 8*24 pdqsi 			 5)	33 mhz operational 		fuzzy startup sound 		problems with hi density disks 6)	33 mhz operational 		fuzzy startup sound 	heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu 	 7)	25 mhz operational. occasional crash at 33 mhz 8)	25 mhz operational. 	using fpu rated at 16 mhz without difficulty 	 9)	25 mhz operational. 	pds adapter with a spectrum 24pdqsi graphics card and a 	videospigot, a 20mhz fpu 	heat sink on cpu 	 10)	25 mhz operational. 33 mhz failed after several hours. 11)	25 mhz operational 	 5/80+quicksilver/fpu(only upgrade) 	 12)	25 mhz operational. tried 33 mhz - system won't start. 	heat sink on cpu 	configured with 		realtech fpu/adapter card 		supermac 8*24 pdqsi 		realtech cache. 	cpu on continuously - no problems. 	floppy works fine at 1.4mb @ 25 mhz 	 13) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 14) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 15) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 16) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 17) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	on 17-19 hours per day 	 18) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu + cooling fan 	no floppy problems at 25 mhz 	 19) 20 mhz operational. bombed soon after startup at 25 mhz with nubus adapter 	20 mhz rated cpu 	ram 70 ns in slots, 80 on motherboard 	 20) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink added to cpu later. no damage while unheatsinked. 	apple nubus adapter with fpu installed. 	 21) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 22) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 23) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 24) 25 mhz operational 	heat sink on cpu 	 guy kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

my recently modified quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz clock oscillator). i have also tried a 55 mhz cmos clock and that works as well. on the more stupid side, i've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make your q700 as slow as a centris 610. however, a 25 mhz clock which would have yielded a 12.5 mhz quadra 700 (who'd want one?) didn't work at all. impatiently awaiting a 66 mhz clock, guy kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

hello, we need the code for decompression of quicktime jpeg pict files, as they don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source. the code should be in c pascal or modula. the code will be used on several platforms to view pictures over isdn. perhaps a special hardware will be put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a dsp with some support chips) if the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to decompress them. christian bauer bauer@informatik.uni-ulm.de

hi, i'm having problems tying to get a sony dat drive to work. i'm using retrospect 1.3ci, and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a mac iici, which has now unfortunately gone to another department. ideally, we want to attach it to our quadra 950 setup. i can't seem to get the retrospect software to recognize the media at all. when in the "devices" dialog, it can see the dat device, but comes up with, firstly, 'running', secondly 'media failure' and then immediately 'contents unknown'. this does not happen with the mac iici setup, which simply says 'ready'. i'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some solution... i know some others who have had problems with dat devices and their quadra, but they have a mac iici which they can use! the symptoms system software is 7.1, also didn't work with 7.0.1 i have tried the following: turn off all extensions, except retrospect scsi (required) tested on a variety of machines: quadra, iisi, and lc (at least). connected no other scsi devices tested all varieties of scsi termination etc. replaced the dat unit with a new one (yes! we got that desperate!) read the retrospect manual (even more desperate :)) replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. i'll post any solutions to this group. cheers, matt. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ______ matthew riddle matthew@ariel.unimelb.edu.au | ---- | science multimedia teaching unit tel 61 3 344 6400 || || faculty of science fax 61 3 344 5803 | ---- | university of melbourne | -- | australia my opinions are my own! ====== ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

i read in a recent tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting a 68030 in a pb100. i am interested in doing so, but would like to know more about it. does it involve just replacing the 68000 that is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter- board. also, would the 68030 be able to run qt with the pb100's screen(not pretty i know, but possible?) and of course, what would the damage be ($). any info would be appreciated. thanks in advance. jay fogel

i have replaced the osz to 66 mhz yesterday and no truble at all. my quadra now works at 33 mhz stable for more than 14 hours. i have also tried a 70 mhz osz, but after 1/2 hour my quadra 700 died. i am not sure what was the reason for that, but it is to risky to run it to fast. most of your quadras 700 should work at 33 mhz without any problems. but a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. during my 35 mhz test i damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. so once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!! now the speedometer results after replacing the osz. speedometer report for menes rainer. prepared april 22, 1993. machine record version #: 5 user comment: quadra 700 33mhz and ram disk 20 mbyte ram + 2 mbyte vram system information: computer: mac quadra 700 cpu: mc68040 fpu: integral fpu mmu: integral mmu color quickdraw: 2.30 (32 bit qd) system version: 7.1.6 finder version: d1-7.1 appletalk version: 57 laserwriter version: d1-7.1.2 laser prep version: not found imagewriter version: d1-7.0.1 rom version: $067c rom size: 1024 bit depth: 1 horizontal dpi: 72 vertical dpi: 72 primary screen size: 832 x 624 physical ram: 20480k logical ram: 20454k p.r. results (uses mac classic as 1.0): cpu: 21.625 graphics: 30.052 disk: 28.351 name of hard disk tested: ram disk math: 135.128 performance rating (pr): 36.848 benchmark results (uses mac classic as 1.0): kwhetstones: 1500.000 205.479 dhrystones: 26315.789 27.008 towers: 24.960 quicksort: 22.391 bubble sort: 23.823 queens: 24.105 puzzle: 28.804 permutations: 26.523 fast fourier: 167.728 f.p. matrix multiply: 154.452 integer matrix multiply: 30.250 sieve: 25.602 benchmark average: 63.427 fpu tests (uses mac ii as 1.0): @@ffpu fast fourier: 14.636 fpu kwhetstones: 5454.545 7.636 fpu f.p. matrix mult.: 14.333 fpu test average: 12.202 color tests (uses mac ii as 1.0): black & white: 6.395 4 colors: 6.773 16 colors: 6.957 256 colors: 7.016 color test average: 6.785 very interesting are the graphics results (graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. two points which my cause problems are the 4 mbyte ram solder on the board. the are only 80ns rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 mhz. the next part which may cause trouble are the video rams. i have the orignal 100ns vrams from apple in my quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. most of the other parts on the quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble. the most importaned question is do i neat a new heat sink. i would say no. after running my quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. a 33 mhz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the quadra, so i didn't see any problems. the room temperatur was 22 celsius (72 f). if you living in a area were it is hot 100 f (45 c) and your room temperatur is not mutch below i would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side. hope you will have the same success than i had, rainer email: menes@statistik.tu-muenchen.de

>yes, i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on. but what about >monitors? they generate a lots of heat. should i or shouldn't i keep them on >24 hours a day? any advice? thanks. take care...paul i vote for turning them off at night. the stress of off/on is a little harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea. the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along with heat. we have a lot of 10-year old machines in the basement that still work, but who cares?

i have also moved on to a 66.6 mhz clock. thus far not problems. i'm not totallysurprised as i've had q700 run at 35.4 mhz (cpu clock speed) using a vso. my 25 mhz rated daystar quadracache got very hot at 32 mhz and would fail previously. i glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed ram chips and it runs cool without problems at 33.3 mhz. the combination is faster than a q950.
i purchased 2x8 mb 72-pin (60 ns) simms for my quadra 800 from chip merchant (i've been very satisfied with them in the past). either one alone works, but both together fail. i called apple for advice and was told that there was a problem with "composite" simms. only non-composite simms should be used with the q-800. chip merchant confirmed that they presently sell only composite 72-pin simms. so, q-800 simms need to be both 60 ns and non-composite. marty sachs ---------------------------------------------------------------- usda/ars & agronomy/uiuc msachs@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu [internet] s108 turner hall msachs@uiucvmd [bitnet] 1102 s. goodwin ave.

so what's the deal with the pds slot in the iisi? i recently purchased a mac iisi. i want to add a non-apple monitor to the system. i was told that you could buy a 90 degree angled pds to nubus adaptor card so you can fit a standard nubus card into the computer. am i mistaken or do have to buy a pds monitor card specifically for the iisi? i've seen the pds monitor cards for the si, but they seem expensive, and i'm not exactly made of money. any ideas? help. clue me in! -- randy l. riegsecker --------------------------------------------------------------------- "barney must die." i need somebody to shove. --------------------------------------------------------------------- disclaimer: the opinions expressed here are mine and not anyone else's.

>	i wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost) >to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would >reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than >some amount of time. i believe that apple, sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power-saving techniques; this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see it. this may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on automatically. (is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?) goals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30 watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on this). note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial, especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems. sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company (sun itself) on the order of $1m per year. putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would probably have greater than double that value. given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...), building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data i heard. btw: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front. there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling. this may only apply to the monitors we use, but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back.

the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one. if your running the drive on a mac i would recommend a shareware utility called timedrive which tests seek, scsi throughput and rotational speed. this utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives. *************************************************************************** the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.

hi everyone, i'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing on the hp deskwriter (sys 7.1, deskwriter driver 3.1, powerbook 170). when i print from, say, ms word, i see the message "spooling to disk," but sometimes nothing prints. checking my memory map thanks to now menus, i see that hp backgrounder has not loaded. restarting fixes this. it seems to me that hp backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its status as "multifinder not aware" allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as "hp backgrounder quit unexpectedly." have you ever seen this problem before. there may or may not be a related problem. i have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep. choosing "sleep" from the finder menu sometimes does nothing. today on a whim i checked the memory map, and i discovered that hp backgrounder was not loaded. restarted reloaded hp backgrounder, and i was able to put my machine to sleep as usual. just a mere coincidence or is the hp backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep? 	has anyone seen this problem? i'm seriously considering the purchase of a stylewriterii because of the poor quality of the hp software. 	please send your answers directly to me and post to the net. 	yours truly, 	marc bizer

i just thought i would pass along my experience with aps. i recently ordered an external quantum 240. the salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. installing the drive was simple; i didn't even have to read the manual. the scsi address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. i daisy-chained the drive from my syquest (also from aps) and booted up with no problems. i'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. it's a pretty good assortment. the drive/fan is a bit noisier than i would like, but i think it'll be ok. the speed seems very good, although i haven't run any objective tests. it also seems to spin up pretty quickly; i can hit the power switch for it, and almost immediately power the mac without any problems booting from the drive. some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older syquest case is metal. there is one led, which is normally green, and flickers red as the drive is accessed. just a data point, rich +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ richard c. long		 | long@mcntsh.enet.dec.com "ludicrous speed!! go!!!!" | ...!decwrl!mcntsh.enet.dec.com!long -- dark helmet | long%mcntsh.dec@decwrl.enet.dec.com

it happened to my classic ii once. at startup, after the usual powerup tone, there were chimes (kinda like do(1st)-mi(1st)-sol(1st)-do(2nd) or 1st c - 1st e - 1st g - 2nd c on the music scale), and it hanged before giving the happy mac. i had to re-powerup. this was asked before but i can't remember the answer. i've tried to find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail. can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean? a spurious memory check error? thanks willie*
i was reading a review of the centris 610 in this months macworld and the reviewer said that for $4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed of the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz. i haven't heard of this before, and i don't think that this is the 040 chip replacement (with fpu) that i have seen so much talk about. anyone have any ideas? cwera@du.edu
the article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on quadra 700's and iisi's. i haven't read a report of this actually being done on a centris 610 but supposedly this also works on q900, q950 and centris 650 machines.
here's the scoop: for the past two years, i have been using an se/30 with a sony 1304s and a lapis video card. this past month, i bought a quadra 800 and am now using the sony on it. my se/30 has been shipped home to my father who is planning on getting an apple 14" monitor (the trinitron one). my question is this: what kind of power cord will he get with the apple monitor. does it come with two types? as i recall, one can hook up the power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my quadra 800. however, for my father's se/30, there is no extra plug which allows use of the se/30's power supply. he needs to plug it into the socket separately. so...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow him to do this? will have to buy a different cable? if yes, where can he purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables? thanks in advance, derek ****************************************************************************** derek fong * email: thewho@plume.mit.edu dept. of physical oceanography * thewho@darla.whoi.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ bldg 54-1511a * clark laboratory 317 massachusetts institute of technology * woods hole oceanographic institution cambridge, ma 02139 * woods hole, ma 02543 (617) 253-2922 * (508) 457-2000 x2814 *******************************************************************************

i have a sony 1304s whch i would like to hook up so that i get its power though my quadra 800's power supply. ie, if i had an apple monitor, i could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when i hit the power button the keyboard, both the monitor and computer go on, and when i shut down, both go off. is there an extension cord type cable i can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug this "extension cable" into my quadra? any thoughts and comments would be appreciated, thanks in advance, derek ****************************************************************************** derek fong * email: thewho@plume.mit.edu dept. of physical oceanography * thewho@darla.whoi.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ bldg 54-1511a * clark laboratory 317 massachusetts institute of technology * woods hole oceanographic institution cambridge, ma 02139 * woods hole, ma 02543 (617) 253-2922 * (508) 457-2000 x2814 *******************************************************************************

the origional bit is missing but long/short follows: the origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris (hence title). the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes. you can use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris. you do need an adaptor (i use a mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two machines. the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor. now, the special interest disclaimer. the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400 resolution. if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (i prefer this on my 1604s). then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates. i would advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue. as to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue. apple will treat you like a f**king assanine idiot for even considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you to pay for their thech support line (the supposedly compitantly one) and then still has no fu***** clue. personal experience. also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers doesn't see to extend to macs (sony, magnavox). in addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits (*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution 1168x832 on this $5, 9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you display two full pages side by side. all you need is our reasonably priced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz vertical.") note: with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible. using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch. -a.

hi- do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture apple uses in the powerbook duos? or in the powerbook in general? what are the factors that make the duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop machine running the same processor at the same speed (25mhz 68030)? how many wait states are in the memory system, etc? what kind of a data bus does it use? 32-bit or 16-bit? it's still slow when plugged into a duodock. anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when making notebooks? i heard of a 486dx2/66 notebook getting a "whopping" 10 mips rating. a similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that, i guess. -avery
we are having a problem with a quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-) this quadra is 'stuffed' with 64mb ram, 2mb vram and some large disk (400mb i think). what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. it is quite apparent that the mac cpu is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications, even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ;-) we had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied. the first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the cache was turned off (yes off). this is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the cpu right?). the second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it, but did it twice within an hour yesterday). the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway). these included: -swapping the ram -swapping the vram -swapping monitors (3 different 13" apple rgb and 2 16" apple rgb) -swapping cables -disconnecting hd and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals here are some other facts: -when we put a rasterops procolor 32 on the nubus, the problem is fixed (it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out) -the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab -apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us. here are some speculations: -i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much ram and vram on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can reproduce it with just 4mb of ram, so this is probably a red herring). -the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the mac's operation. we have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in the exact same spot....) please don't tell me this is probably it, i do not want to believe it. -it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site. has anyone any ideas? please? please email as well as posting cause i seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news! :-) thank you in advance. carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlo@vision.arc.nasa.gov -- carlo@cvs.rochester.edu | carlo@white.stanford.edu | we always remember you have a choice. carlo@vision.arc.nasa.gov |

a rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that they have been having lots of problems with their centris 610. he didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files. it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems and software compatibility problems with the machine. he's not recommending the centris 610 to anybody; he says to consider a centris 650 or a iivx. (why he would recommend a iivx over an lciii i don't know, but that's what he said.) so, what does the net think? did the dealer just get one flaky machine, or did apple send the c610 out the door too early? is your c610 working just great, or is it buggy too? 	jay scott 	scott@cs.uiuc.edu

i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac. it uses a scsi interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into. i have tried my friend's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and it works. see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi box by itself. warning: most of the cost of mac handscanners is contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up to around $200. when i upgraded my old style scanner to the new gray scale model, it cost $75; they just gave me a new scan head and software; the box was the same. the gray scale scanner + interface runs about $300; making it around $200 for the interface. collin
i recently bought a pli 21mgbyte floptical drive, and i was very happy with it until i tried to use it to format a 1.4 hd diskette. i put the hd floppy in my superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it correctly, and now my superdrive refuses to recognize any floppy (it says "this disk is unreadable" and asks if i want to format it) even original systems floppies from apple. nor will it format the disks if i try to ("initialization failed!") strangely enough the floptical still reads both the 21 mb and 1.4 hd disks, but i cant look at my 800k floppies, and if i have a crash i'm screwed because the floptical can't be used as a start-up disk. pli has been unresponsive. any ideas? has this happened to anyone before? i was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and now i am looking at an expensive repair. help! respond to this thread, or email mfeldman@acs.bu.edu

i have done several of these upgrades (about 6 iisi's, and 1 quadra 700), and the best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". if possible, you should look for the silicon-free stuff. there's a comany who makes the stuff called tech spray, their address is: p.o. box 949, amarillo, tx 79105. you should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct tape  that stuff is for ducts... when using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small space between the heat sink and the cpu. mario murphy **** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in **** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views.
i believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. since there is no error #64, then i would guess that it would be a -64 error. which is a font manager error of "error during font declairation". i would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start up on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that. mario murphy **** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in **** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views.

the first problem was the sound. i tried the m0, but then even the logon was muted. i don't want that. any other suggestions for that hissing? the second is really strange. first, i kept mentioning that fc slowed down all the time and took too long. well i just logged on with extensions off and i didn't have any slowdown. also, last time i was online i quit (which usually disconnects and quits). it disconnected but it wouldn't quit. i had to force quit, and then when i launched fc again it said the modem port was in use. this is really strange. i thought it might have to do with fax software. or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely explanation). so, any suggestions? -david **** from planet bmug, the firstclass bbs of bmug. the message contained in **** this posting does not in any way reflect bmug's official views.

i've been playing with a centris 610 (8/230) for the last couple weeks. the only problem that i have seen is that a couple of the applications i run are incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so i have to run with it turned off. actually, the main thing i don't like it is that it doesn't have a software powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is directly under the floppy drive! (i haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night i'm going to be really upset with that design decision.....) in all, no problems with it. floppy and printing have been just fine.

hi, i just test installed kanjitalk 6.07 on my iici and got a black screen, a way sick looking mac icon, and when hitting the programmers reset, a tone sequence that i guess is the infamous "tones of death." i was able to reboot off a floppy, removed the japanese system, and set up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 7.01 back. now have no overt problems with the mac. any idea what caused the tones? i forget the numbers but 7fff comes to mind. if it is some self diagnostic, why would an older system version catch it, and not 7. ?

interesting delema for all those out there. my school is discussing installing a mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our bio 100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections. (no joke) here is the deal. we can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a disection via the computer or via the real thing. my problem is i was somehow drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go mac but know nada about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so i wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing list? right now we are looking at the c650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms. ok here it goes: 	we are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal apple cd-roms offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. it is a matter of price and reliability, the second being very important. 	how much ram? i was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8? what do you think? 	ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard (extended) is 160.30. is it better to go with the apple and their long time great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is just a reliable? price? 	printers: one color printer we are presently leaning towrds the thermal wax tektronic 200e or 200i (probably the e as we are going to limit access so we don't needed the i's networkability) so, what do you think in terms of color printers? different brand? kind (dye sublimation? ink jet?) price? companies? 1800 #s? also, we are looking to get a laser printer or such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing. the fornt runner is the apple pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. suggestions? we have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through and they know nothing about it for the most part. it has to be reliable, easy to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc). 	finally, and this is my little dig into the project. what about netting these things? we have ether nearby and i would like to slap the macs on the net, but, server? individual ether? forget about it it is going to be astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask them? 	little more info, i am a poli sci major who just happens to know alot about macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention i don't have the time to go and look for all of this stuff. so i am hoping the collective resources and intelect of the net can help (has before) [shameless plug: buy empower!!! great security program!!!] 	disclaimer: this post is not and will never be supported by my university. they do not condone in any way my using this media to illict info. this is a proj by bio majors so they re the real persons. 	anyinfo please send to the email above or to make it real clear rmwbb@wittenberg.edu and damn i hope my editor is alive when i get done typing s there is not another stupid blank post. 	i reserve the right to claim all this info as mine and use it to get everything i want form my universities red taped administration. this info may be used for blackmail purposes and for obtaining undo amounts of praise and god like status. this info may also be used to get credits i probaly really don't deserve. 	that is the ned of it. any questions? and thanks ahead of time!! once again taping the collective genius of the internet, scott d. sauer
in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two 160's 1 has a 8mb simm and the other a 6 mb simm both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed by different people. both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the memory chimes. crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer. in both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback, my marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger simms are "lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something? anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - if somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving. i've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8mb simm with a 2mbsimm -although this is not desireble solution. please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world. ted ted schreiber mechanical enginering northwestern university tel: 708.491.5386 fax 708.491.3915 email: rts@nwu.edu

according to what i saw in a store today, the performa 405 is not the same as an lciii. it only has a 16mhz 68030 while the lciii has a 25mhz 030. correct me if i am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer. dealers who sell the performa are known to have about as much knowledge about macs as i do about dos machines. saurabh.

the 486 at the same clock is not as fast as the 040 at the same clock speed. the '040 also has much better floating point unit. now the dx2-66 is faster than the '040 at 33mhz. but for your reference the 486 at 33 mhz gets ~14mips while the '040 at 33mhz gets ~20mips.

(2) some vga-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the mac uses to drive the apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution color display"---i.e., apple's own 640x480 mode. so, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your iisi, you need (a) an adapter that converts from the mac db-15 connector to the vga-style high density db-15 connector, *but* tells the mac to use it's own 640x480 mode, not the vga 640x480 mode, and (b) a vga monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac 640x480 mode over the vga 640x480 mode (which as i stated in (1) above, the iisi cannot produce). as far as (a) above is concerned, contact james engineering, inc. 6329 fairmount ave. el cerrito, ca 94530 510-525-7350 fax: 510-525-5740 they can probably get you the right adapter. remember: you do *not* want the run-of-the-mill mac-to-vga adapter, because it will try to have your iisi produce the vga mode, which it cannot (the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all). instead, you want an adapter that connects between the mac-style and vga-style connectors, but tells the mac to use the apple 640x480 mode. sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction. as far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 khz and a vertical retrace rate of 67 hz. these are the spec's of apple's 640x480 mode. for comparison, the vga-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 khz horizontal bandwidth and a 60 hz. vertical retrace rate. the monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as the apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes in the pc compatible world. good luck! 	-fred martin -- fred martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 ames st. rm. e15-301 epistemology and learning group, mit media lab | cambridge, ma 02139 usa

(might be a useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80m, though i must admit that i am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my computer, i was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that i rarely use to because i was running out of space, without having started using dtp stuff, softpc or trying any unix os!) -peter bell@minerva.cis.yale.edu

i thought i'd share a good experience, too. i bought the aps quantum 240 zero footprint drive in may '92 (back when they still used two separate leds on the front panel and the case was metal). while traveling with it (it was in my se/30 mac bag, on top of the mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive. i lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i had to take, which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out). i called aps for an rma # and got one, with no questions asked about how the tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers -- though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, i'm never flying with my se/30 again). and when i called back to ask whether i could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem with that -- even when i exceeded the normal valid period for an rma # by a day (they're usually good for 10 days). the front panel was replaced under warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (i mailed it first class insured on a saturday by noon from l.a. to missouri, and it came back by fed ex by friday [i don't know exactly what day it came back because i was traveling that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon]). the only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep i talked to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that i take the drive mechanism out and send just the case. unfortunately, i discovered the day i was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty! oh, well. al albert@seas.ucla.edu
well, you can always try and find a pc dealer who sells guaranteed memory. i work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds of computers per year. it never fails, machines come in with bad simms. now for those of you who are wondering just why your pc or mac just crashed i can tell you i always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or designed the software. well, i don't think that way anymore, especially with the results i have gotten with replacing bad simms in my own machine and others at work. the moral to this story is to make sure your memory is good. i would be willing to bet lots of you out there have simms with either soft or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once in awhile those bad simms just makes your life hell. i just got plain sick of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine just crashed and they lost thier work. in case your wondering, or if you haven't already guessed i work in an is department. service is a do or die perogative in this line of work, so the moral is: have your memory tested with a simm hardware tester...and no i don't mean the simple little software programs that you can run in your machine. simms are complicated little beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively. if any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices which are not cheap, write me back. they make life a little bit easier, and besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide. -greg carter

hello 	i recently accelerated my mac plus (micromac 25mhz accelerator) and now i can't get my mac to boot off of the hard disk. it boots fine from a floppy, and i can mount the hard disk using scsi probe, but i cannot get it to boot from the hard drive. i installed a new driver, so i don't think that is the problem. 	this poses a rather large problem. i only have 4 meg of ram, and i need to run mathematica, which requires 5 meg. i was hoping to use system 7 virtual memory so that i could run mathematica. however, i can't run system 7 from a floppy, so i can't get enough ram. 	any suggestions? thanks for your time-- 						chrisw@yang.earlham.edu

i have a few questions that i would like answers to (or opinions on) since i'm thinking about buying a lc-iii: q1) when the powerpc-based macs are announced, what will happen to the 680x0-based macs? q2) is system 7 the 'last word' for 680x0-based macs? will we ever get real multi-tasking for the mac? q3) will there be a way for nubus/pds-equipped macs to add a powerpc-on-a-board to their systems? i'd hate to think that i'm going to put my $$ down on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a dead-end product line! thanks in advance, ------------ mike norman,c/o bell-northern research p.o. box 3511 station 'c' ottawa ontario canada k1y 4h7 m/s 115 internet: mwnorman@bnr.ca tel: (613) 763-7717 (fax:613-763-5568) "hasta la vista, baby!" a. schwarzenegger

hey all- we have an old (1990) external hd attached to the plus in our lab. it had given us flawless service until last week. the problem: someone in our lab has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a plus with an aftermarket simm/scsi setup (digigraphics "simmer"). the db25 scsi plug runs through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin rectangular connector. well, this guy had removed the back from the machine, to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the scsi plug. since the 26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside down, essentially reversing the pins on the db25. he came in and asked if he could try out our hd on his scsi port (it had never been used). naive fools that we are, we said o.k.. his computer failed to recognize the drive. now, none of the computers in our lab will recognize it. we tried disk doctor, and it doesn't recognize anything on the scsi chain. could installing the scsi upside down have wrecked the hd's driver board? the drive seems to spin up all right and unpark itself upon powerup. the events are too coincidental to attribute the problem to stiction. any help greatly appreciated- james jak@fff.chem.utah.edu (next mail)
i have an old apple rgb monitor for a iigs which looks a whole lot like the 12" monitor. i have the sneaking suspicion that if i had the right cable i could use it on my mac. does anyone know if my suspicions are correct or am i just full of it. 	mkd

i used to hate it when people posted messages like this, but now that i am contemplating a purchase, i can see why they do. so, has anyone heard of any upcoming (within the next 6 months) advances in the powerbook line? can we expect to see a powerpc powerbook at some point in the future (i assume an 040 would take too much power and generate too much heat for installation in a powerbook)? thanks for your help.

a friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a hd disk. apparently it rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get more space out of a normal hd floppy disk. it supposedly gets upto 1.6 megs (so something like 1640k?). i don't have the program - since i can't use it and its supposed to be called something like "form16" or something like that. my question is whether its possible to do this on the mac and if its not possible is it due to hardware limitations. a developer friend of mine said that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field much. thanks for any information contributed. steve
i hooked up an old 40meg external mac hardrive to a powerbook 230. i reformatted the drive, copied all the files from the powerbook except the systemfolder, deleted the files from the powerbook (my biggest error, sigh) and then rebooted the whole set up and... chimes of death. i get the following sad mac error, 00000f 000003 i ran norton and it claims its a bad scsi driver and suggests replaceing it. i used apples disk tools but i couldn't update the hardrives scsi driver as it claimed it was in use, but i couldn't even mount the thing (though i could see it when checking the scsi bus, after turning it on after booting my machine first). what does that error above refer to? am i on the right track? is there anything i can do short of intialising the drive, since i need the data on there! thanks ed bourne

i have a question for y'all: i'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" fast scsi-2 drives from micropolis in the june, 1993, macworld. (i have seen similar ads for the ide versions in ibm pc magazines) well, the ad says that all three drives have a fast scsi-2 interface, but then it says that the dtr rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second, *max*. how can this be? i thought that if a drive was to be fast scsi-2 it had to have a dtr of 10megs a second? (i am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by micropolis is from the 512k cache. i admit that i would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data at 5megs a second!) thank you.

a friend is heavily into midi and is using a quadra 900 (maybe 950) with all but one nubus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video card. he reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of what he needs to see. he also reports that the built-in video is even worse. he's not a mac guru, and i haven't seen the system, so this is about all i know. i suspect that his nubus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might come from a switch to an accelerated pds slot video card. does this sound right? who makes a pds accelerated video card for the quadra thats worth looking at? any other suggestions? thanks in advance! -- email: agorski@mitre.org arthur m. gorski (713) 333-0980 snail: the mitre corporation, 1120 nasa road one, houston, texas 77058

i have some questions about this subject. i like to leave my computer on if i think i'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or 3 hours, but i get sick of my dad constantly coming up to me and asking "why is the computer on if you're not using it?" i also wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from other things (garbage disposal, etc.) here are my questions: how much harm do voltage fluctuations cause? my computer does not share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose doesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything. all these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer, right? i also notice the fan in my system saver turning at different speeds. is it safer to turn it off and back on when i want to use it or to leave it on? how much electricity does my computer use? i have an apple iigs (ne flames), with a kensington system saver gs (1 electric fan inside), an applecolor rgb monitor, and an external 3.5" hd (1 fan and its own p/s). how do i translate this into kilowatt-hours? also, how much of this is used by the monitor? does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is totally black but still on? many computers spin the hd up and down constantly to save power. i always thought this was harmful to the hd and defeats the purpose of leaving the computer on in the first place (except portables). is this true? thanks for the info. i think this will help lots of people. stacy
