gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables but i want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. i have been doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but before going further, i thought i would ask whether someone has already done the work. any pointers?? thanx in advance tom weston | usenet: weston@ucssun1.sdsu.edu department of philosophy | (619) 594-6218 (office) san diego state univ. | (619) 575-7477 (home) san diego, ca 92182-0303 |

some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction. (ie: on a closed cube, all normals point outwards). you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a set of points, edges and faces? say that you had a cube with all faces that have their normals facing outwards, except for one face. what's the best way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points re-ordered? i thought i had a good way of telling this, but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 2d polygon. i'd like something for 3d data. any hints, tips, references would be appreciated. steve -- where humor is concerned there are no standards -- no one can say what is good or bad, although you can be sure that everyone will. -- john kenneth galbraith ------- these opinions are my own.

'cause it can't, i'll wager. actually, i have wagered, i quit trying to make fractal compression work- and i was trying- because i don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques. it is neat, though. :-) i'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal. that's why i don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical. i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but i don't see anyone using it in a real product. it's been six years since iterated systems was formed, right? 	"there are always going to be questions until there's a product 	out there," sloan replies. the company plans to ship its first 	encoding devices in the summer, he says. in march, iterated 	systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders. 		- scientific american, march 1990, page 77 allen b (don't even get me started :-) )

you'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing in the new colours. use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes). then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok. you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode. geoff thomas			geoffrey@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz computer science dept. university of canterbury private bag				+-------+ christchurch				| oook! | new zealand				+-------+

hi: i am digitizing a ntsc signal and displaying on a pc video monitor. it is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow gamma-law. i am not certain if these non-linearities are "gamma-corrected" before encoding ntsc signals or if the tv display is supposed to correct this. also, if 256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a c program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a pc monitor? in other words does pc monitor display circuitry correct for "gamma errrors"? your response is much appreciated. amjad. amjad soomro ccs, computer science center u. of maryland at college park email: amjad@wam.umd.edu

i have posted a dos mpeg decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities. here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation: dmpeg v1.0 public domain mpeg decoder by stefan eckart 0. features =========== dmpeg/dmplay is another mpeg decoder/player for the pc: - decodes (nearly) the full mpeg video standard (i,p,b frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires vga) - several dithering options: ordered dither, floyd-steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under dos, 640kb ram, no ms-windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for vga and many super-vgas ... 4. technical information ======================== the player is a rather straightforward implementation of the mpeg spec [1]. the idct is based on the chen-wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, i know). blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2d-idct (sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this (quite common) case. dithering is pretty standard. main difference to the berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. this leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (i claim, judge yourself). restricted color-space means that the u and v components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors. saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. this yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the pal tv standard to improve on ntsc). the improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas. ... -- stefan eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de

(see "postscript language", by adobe systems incorporated, isbn # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985). so, given a line l and a polygon p, we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p, and then "outputs" the answer. by "output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon. a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q, and thus the original problem. there are two small problems with this approach. 	(1) there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the 	reduced problem q. so, we will be forced to invoke the axiom of 	choice (or equivalently, zorn's lemma). but the use of the axiom of 	choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days. 	(2) more importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the 	postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper; or in 	other words, will it halt? 	now, postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a 	turing machine might do; thus the halting problem (for postscript) is 	undecidable. it is quite possible that the original problem will turn 	out to be undecidable. i won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both. a couple of references might be: 1. principia mathematica. newton, i. cambridge university press, cambridge, england. (sorry, i don't have an isbn# for this). 2. an introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation. hopcroft, j and ulman, j. 3. the c programming language. kernighan, b and ritchie, d. 4. a tale of two cities. dickens, c. -------- from: td@alice.uucp (tom duff) summary: overkill. organization: at&t bell laboratories, murray hill nj the situation is not nearly as bleak as baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around the labs for long enough). by the well known dobbin-dullman reduction (see j. dullman & d. dobbin, j. comp. obfusc. 37,ii: pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to hamiltonian circuit, without(!) the use of grobner bases, so lpi (to coin an acronym) is probably only np-complete. besides, turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.) -------- from: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (david baraff) well, sure its no worse than np-complete, but that's only if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

hi everyone, i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups: *******announcing the release of multiverse-1.0.2******* multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, x-windows based virtual reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research. features: client-server based model, using berkeley sockets. no limit to the number of users (apart from performance). generic clients. customizable servers. hierachical objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources). multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot). objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily attached. functionality: client: the client is built around a 'fast' render loop. basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint. it also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users. the client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it. the adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers. this release of the client software supports the following functionality: o hierarchical objects (with associated addressing) o multiple light sources and types (ambient, point and spot) o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading (optional wireframe for 	faster frame rates) o mouse and keyboard input (some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the powerglove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because i don't have one! this will, however, be one of the first enhancements!) server(s): this is where customization can take place. the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers: o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally. things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects: o server selectable extension installation: what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world. basically you call the extension initialisers you want. o event handler registration: when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to. (current events supported: init, move, change, collide & terminate) o collision detection registration: if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software. your callback will be activated when a collision occurs. this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose. the following is all you need to make a world server application: o provide an initworld function: this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus any initialization you want to do. o provide a positionobject function: this is where you determine where to place a new client. o provide an installworldobjects function: this is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client. o provide a getworldtype function: this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have. o provide an animateworld function: this is where you can go wild! at a minimum you should let the objects move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit (to avoid outrunning the clients). that's all there is to it! and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i've provided: generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the stairs! will probably be improved with future versions) dogfight - 72 lines location: this software is located at the following site: ftp.u.washington.edu directory: pub/virtual-worlds file: multiverse-1.0.2.tar.z futures: client: o texture mapping. o more realistic rendering: i.e. z-buffering (or similar), gouraud shading o hmd support. o etc, etc.... server: o physical modelling (gravity, friction etc). o enhanced object management/interaction o etc, etc.... both: o improved comms!!! i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and i'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-( i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe - i've certainly found fascinating developing it, and i would *love* to add support for the powerglove...and an hmd :-)!! finally one major disclaimer: this is totally amateur code. by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure desperation, provide. i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - use it at your own risk! disclaimer over! of course if you love it, i would like to here from you. and anyone with positive contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. anyone who hates it: > /dev/null! ************************************************************************ ********* and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to write :-)! ************************************************************************ ********* thanks, robert. robert@acsc.com ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

in regards to fractal commpression, i have seen 2 fractal compressed "movies". they were both fairly impressive. the first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of casablanca, it was 1.3mb and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video. it was a little grainy but not bad at all. the second one i saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2mb. i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore. but unlike many other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution. i don't know what kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" i saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate. but as i said above playback was 10 or more frames per second. and how else could you put 11 minutes on one floppy disk? davidr@rincon.ema.rockwell.com my opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case i will probably change my mind.

this past week i've been playing with some of the r-d (reaction- diffusion, not to be confused with rds or r&d) techniques from siggraph '91. i was wondering what material is available to explain the control mechanism a little more. it seems to me very much like a matter of picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting. although both of the papers (turk and witkin & kass) were very well organized and extremely helpful, i guess what i need is a more basic description of the technique, especially wrt the control mechanisms. the tests that i did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become unstable. is there any info available online? source code would be great but not necessary. thanks! -- --- terran j. boylan, sr. artist/programmer | "it's better to have loved engineering animation, inc., ames, ia | and lost than just to have (515) 296-9908 / (515) 296-7892 (> 5pm) | lost." -- dorky dog

(note that grafsys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to) grafsys 1.11 comes in two versions. one for the 881 and 020 or above processors. the other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any mac. both versions are *100% source compatibel*. grafsys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3d graphics and how to use the package. if demand is big enough i will convert the grafsys to an object-class library. however, i feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'oop-guild'. grafsys is free for any non-commercial usage. read the documentation enclosed. enjoy, christian franz

our group recently bought a mitsubishi p78u video printer and i could use some help with it. we bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images. however, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images. after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlett-packard workstation and i can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine. i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs. this was not mentioned in the sales literature. however they did say the p78u can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call japan, etc. frankly, i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory. it's not like memory is that expensive any more. if anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, i would greatly appreciate your sending it to me. thanks. allan weber signal & image processing institute university of southern california weber@sipi.usc.edu

'86-'90), the power series parallel systems ('88-'93). individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. new graphics architectures at the high end (gt, vgx, realityengine) are released every 18 months to 2 years. these are the facts of life. if we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like indigo, onyx, challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster cpus, faster graphics and i/o, and larger disk capacities. if we don't, we become uncompetitive. from the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today. you can't wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the sales rep for one in writing. if it's feasible, they should be able to do that. some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the performance protection program for older r3000-based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems. |> |> now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to |> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that i found myself |> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books |> just before the end of the quarter), but i'm just a little tired of |> getting boned in the process. |> if that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base. |> maybe it's because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies, so we |> aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the big kids (nasa, |> for instance) are. this lab, and i suspect that a lot of other labs |> and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers |> every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. most sgi customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments. |> the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the |> entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond. that |> means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i |> have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one |> previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other |> vendor. i'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. |> and every time i look at it, i'm going to think about sgi and how i |> could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're |> supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars). |> five years is an awfully long time in computer years. new processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor. there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up, we know it. josh |:-) -- ************************************************************************** **				 **					** **	joshua mogal		 **	product manager			** **	advanced graphics division **	 advanced graphics systems	** **	silicon graphics inc.	 **	market manager			** **	2011 north shoreline blvd. **	 virtual reality		** **	mountain view, ca 94039-7311 **	 interactive entertainment	** **	m/s 9l-580		 **					** **				 ************************************* **	tel:	(415) 390-1460						** **	fax:	(415) 964-8671						** **	e-mail:	mogal@sgi.com						** **									** **************************************************************************

hi steve, as the author of multiverse, i feel i had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software - the quick answer is yes! the long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are the same, you know! as far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-) platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: rs6000, dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible. the main problem is that i don't have access to other platforms than the rs6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it. as far as the software not doing anything, do you really think i would bother releasing it, if that was the case? perhaps you didn't read the few docs that are supplied. the dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see anything! the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't see anything there, then this is definitely a problem! one final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it. if you are interested, then please remember that i'm not asking for any money! so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism, maybe that will get results?? robert. robert@acsc.com
i don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on intel chips. but on the amiga's motorola chips, it was one of the fastest true 'ray tracers' i don't think impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration. in terms of features, and learning curve... all that you stated for 3ds is also true for imagine, and lots more... but i'll have to admit that after 3 years of use on the amiga, the learning curve is very steep. this is due only to the manual. it is realy bad. however, there is a lot of after market support for this product, including regular 'tips' articles in many magazines such as "avid and a great book by steve worley called "understanding imagine 2.0" this book i is not just recommened, it is a must! i think an important consideration should be price...... $3000 for 3ds (not including "tool" packages) under $500 for imagine complete.
sketch: rotate so cylinder axis is || z axis. intersect x/y projection of line with projected cylinder (similar to, but easier than, sphere intersection). result: no intersection, one intersection, or two intersections, parameterized along line by t0 and t1. now look at z, and compute intersections of line with top and bottom planes of cylinder. this gives t0' and t1'. the interval of intersection is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] intersect [t0',t1']. details left as an exercise for the reader. =s -- =spencer w. thomas 		| info tech and networking, b1911 cfob, 0704 "genome informatician"	| univ of michigan, ann arbor, mi 48109 spencer.w.thomas@med.umich.edu	| 313-764-8065, fax 313-764-4133

hi there, i've made a vga mode 13h graphics library available via ftp. i originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful. they are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality. they're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point. *** the library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286. if enough people ask, i'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version. the routines are written in assembly (tasm) and are callable from c. they are fairly simple, but i've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway). routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a "virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc. i've also included a simple c routine to draw a line, as well as a c routine to load a 256 color gif image into a buffer. i also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows". the whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip it is zipped with pkzip 2.04g it is completely in the public domain, as far as i'm concerned. do with it whatever you like. however, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due, and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother) mark morley@camosun.bc.ca

sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer, and then decided to post here to comp.graphics. i'd like the 3d software to run on primarily mac in either c, object pascal (think or mpw). but, i'll port to windows later, so a package that runs on mac and has a windows version would be ideal. i'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs, and reasonable licensing costs... of course :) bobc

a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview. since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. so here it comes: cview has quite a number of bugs. the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous. as far as i can determine, it has to do with the temp files that cview creates. cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its "current directory". the problem you mention occurs (as far as i can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. it seems as if cview doesn't check properly for this situation. as cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information. while it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again. (it does this last "recopy" operation for its "fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) the result of this process is the following: 1) if it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed. 2) if it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card. however, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this) one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk. this is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate. at least the general idea is on track i think, although i have probably made errors in details about file i/o etc. the way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space. the temp files for large jpeg's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 meg + 1 meg ). on some of the largest i have needed in excess of 6 meg free disk space. cview has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy, then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory (and fat table? i can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way. so be careful! it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this. on the other hand, when choosing files in the open files menu, cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square. incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info. and really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? with much thanks to the originator of this article. +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ | rene walter | renew@stack.urc.tue.nl | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | "will i drown in tears of sorrow, is there hope for tomorrow, | | will this world ever get better, can't we all just live together | | i don't wanna live in strife , i just wanna live my life | | i deserve to have a future..." | | -the good girls "future" | +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+

hi, i'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science project group. we are doing computer science honours, and our project is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'. basically, the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar, showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between. the problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the arc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other. if anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile c code :) that might help us, it would be much appreciated. thanks in advance, gregory
hi to all out there. we have this problem, and i'm not certain i'm solving it in the correct way. i was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look... we have an x-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis: | || [ image | x-ray source ] || | screen metallic || tube | || | | we know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole. we do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen. however, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen. however, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently. firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse. i cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is. do i have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation? how do i do this transformation? secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen). how can i compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion? so, please can anyone give us a few pointers here? how do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do i deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen? we'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed. thanks in advance, simon. -- simon marshall, dept. of computer science, university of hull, hull hu6 7rx, uk "football isn't about life and death. it's more important than that." bill email: s.marshall@cs.hull.ac.uk phone: +44 482 465951 fax: 466666 shankley

hi. i'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3d graphics program i've written. my program stores the points of a polygon in ccw order. i've used 3d concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn. does the dxf format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in, cw or ccw? its easy enough to convert, but if i don't know which way they are stored, i dont know which direction the polygon should be visible from. if dxf doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? the best i can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the dxf file, one stored cw and the other ccw. but that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed... thanks in advance for any help, patrice hugo@hydra.unm.edu

hello, i purchased my new 486 with a noname graphics card installed which is obviously speedstar 24 compatible. its name is "vga 4000 truecolor". it is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities vmode, xmode and at least one more mode, as well as some drivers for lotus, windows, etc. only one of the drivers is told to provide the truecolor mode, namely the windows 3.1 driver. nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the truecolor mode. some articles in this group about the speedstar 24 and some other facts made me believe that my card is compatible to that one. does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? how can i write a driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution of 640 x 480 with 45 hz interlaced ? greetings, wolfgang

what are the main advantages of this method? i have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a little bit long. i developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method. it uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons. the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand. my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise. when looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon. has anyone heard of this method before? it is so simple, i doubt i am the first to think of it. libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal techno-rat. i define myself--tsa@cellar.org

image processing and display ========================================================== pc and mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ====================== imdisp ------ imdisp written at jpl and other nasa sites. can do simple display, enhancing, smoothing and so on. works with the fits and vicar/pds data formats of nasa. can read tiff images, if you know their dimensions [pc and macs] labview 2 --------- labview is used as a framework for image processing tools. it provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements. hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram (program). functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc. the tool allows any virtual instrument (vi, a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument. national instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (dsp) boards for macintoshs and pc compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer. new software tools for dsp are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. the tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software. there are three levels of dsp programming associated with the nb-dsp2300 board and labview: use of the nb-dsp2300 analysis library: ffts, power spectra, filters routines callable from think c and macintosh programers workshop (mpw) c that execute on the nb-dsp2300 board. there is an analysis virtual interface library of ready-to-use vis optimized for the nb-dsp2300. use of the national instruments developers toolkit that includes an optimizing c compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the dsp hardware. this approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use. use of the national instruments interface kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the nb-dsp2300 board. (this is the easiest route for the development of custom code.) ultimage concept vi ------------------- concept vi by graftek-france is a family of image processing virtual instruments (vis) that give labview 2 (described above) users high-end tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems. a vi is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument. typical applications for concept vi include thermography, surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging, electronic microscopy and remote sensing. ultimage concept vi addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis. it includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and characterization. the program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane. standard input and output formats include pict, tiff, satie, and aipd. other formats can be imported. image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic operations, and geometric transformations, among others. morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others. quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and morphological distribution. measures include area, perimeter, center of gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and shape factors and equivalence. measures are saved in ascii format. the program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules. a 3-d view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. the histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. there are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity. these include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines. the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude) data. the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts. the transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even hole filling. the program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area, perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points. gtfs, inc. 2455 bennett valley road #100c santa rosa, ca 95494 707-579-1733 iplab spectrum -------------- iplab spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by graftek-franceus ultimage concept vi. using scripting tools, the user tells the system the operations to be performed. the problem is that far too many basic operations require manual intervention. the tool supports: ffts, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a movie command for cycling through windows. macintosh-based tools ===================== ncsa image, ncsa paledit and more --------------------------------- ncsa provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results from numerical modelling calculations. these applications, documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. commercial versions of the ncsa programs have been developed by spyglass. spyglass, inc. 701 devonshire drive champaign, il 61820 (217) 355-6000

plotting." paragon imagine 171 lincoln st. lowell, ma 01852 508-441-2112 adobe photoshop --------------- the tool supports rtrue colors with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey scale. once an image has been imported it can be rre-toucheds with various editing tools typical of those used in macintosh-based rpaints applications. these include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush. advanced rpastes tools that control the interaction between a pasted selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated. for example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from being pasted. photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%, allowing you to create ghost overlays. rphoto-editings tools include control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation modification and spectrum equalization. images can be subjected to various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image, blur edges, or locate edges. image scaling is also supported. for storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as jpeg, availlable from storm technologies. the latest version of adobe photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: epsf, epsf, tiff, pict resource, amiga iff/ilbm, compuserve gif, macpaint, pixar, pixelpaint, scitex ct, tga and thunderscan.. adobe systems, inc. 1585 charlestown road po box 7900 mountain view, ca 94039-7900 415-961-4400 colorstudio and imagestudio --------------------------- colorstudio is an image-editing and paint package from letraset that has more features than adobe photoshop but is decidedly more complex and therefore more difficult to use. several steps are often required to accomplish that which can be done in a single step using photoshop. the application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can easily end up with images in the 30 mb range. the program provides a variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool" which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close hues, color range and mask. imagestudio: don't know... letraset usa 40 eisenhower drive paramus, nj 07653 201-845-6100 dapple systems -------------- "high resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of global or feature parameters, and interpret the data." dapple systems, 355 w. olive ave, #100 sunnyvale, ca 94086 408-733-3283 digital darkroom ---------------- the latest release of digital darkroom has five new selection and editing tools for enhancing images. one such feature allows the user to select part of an image simply by "painting" it. a new polyline selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide selections. a brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion of the image. note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool. this tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale images only. it should be noted that digital darkroom is not as powerful as either adobe photoshop or colorstudio. silicon beach software 9770 carroll ctr. rd., suite j san diego, ca 92126 619-695-6956 dimple ------ it is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires mac lc or ii series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6mb of ram. it has the capability of reading erdas files. functions include; image enhancement, 3d and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and unsupervised classification, pca and other image transformations. there is also a means (image operation language or iol) by which you can write your own transformations. there is no image rectification, however dimple is compatable with mapii. the latest version is 1.4 and it is in the beta stage of testing. dimple was initially developed as a teaching tool and it is very good for this purpose." "dimple runs on a colour macintosh. it is a product still in its development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of other packages, but is coming along nicely. it has its own inbuilt language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining convolution filters etc. dimple is a full mac application with pull down menus etc... it is unprotected software." process software solutions, po box 2110, wollongong, new south wales, australia. 2500. phone 61 42 261757 fax 61 42 264190. enhance ------- enhance has a rrulers tool that supports measurements and additionally provides angle data. the tool has over 80 mathematical filter variations: "laplacian, medium noise filter", etc. files can be saved as either tiff, pict, epsf or text (however epsf files can't be imported). microfrontier 7650 hickman road des moines, ia 50322 515-270-8109 image analyst ------------- an image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images. image analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language. it is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs. image analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically. image analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or a disk-stored image. within minutes, without the need for programming, the image analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image. measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images. image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and position. the tool provides direct support for the data translation and scion frame grabbers. a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr video camera or other ntsc or pal devices. there are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related sequence file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user defines. automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi) represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image. inside a roi, the program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape, the thickness of a wall, etc. image analyst finds the center, edge and other positions automatically. the application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. it also supports histograms and a color look-up table (clut) tool. automatix, inc. 775 middlesex turnpike billerica,

stsdas from stsci.edu [130.167.1.2]. email to iraf@noao.edu for more details. apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical image community. they issue a newsletter also. they seem to support very well their users. works with vms also last i heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the vms/unix shells. it's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under x windows. very flexible/extendable -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer. alv --- a sun-specific image toolkit. version 2.0.6 posted to comp.sources.sun on 11dec89. also available via email to alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk. aips ---- astronomical image processing system. contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu (also see the usenet newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits) built by nrao (national radio astronomy observatory, hq in charlottesville, va, sites in nm, az, wv). software distributed by 9-track, exabyte, dat, or (non-anonymous) internet ftp. documentation (postscript mostly) available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103), directory pub/aips and pub/aips/text/publ. installation requires building the system and thus a fortran and c compiler. this package can read and write fits data (see sci.astro.fits), and is primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of radio astronomy data from radio telescopes, particularly the very large array (vla), a synthesis instrument. it consists of almost 300 programs that do everything from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy. there is an x11-based image tool (xas) and a tek-compatible xterm-based graphics tool built into aips. the xas tool is modelled after the hardware functionality of the international imaging systems model 70 display unit and can do image arithmetic, etc. the code is mostly fortran 77 with some system c language modules, and is available for suns, ibm rs/6000, dec/ultrix, convex, cray (unicos), and alliant with support planned for hp-9000/7xx, solaris 2.1, and maybe sgi. there is currently a project - "aips++" - underway to rewrite the algorithmic functionality of aips in a modern setting, using c++ and an object oriented approach. whereas aips is proprietary code (licensed for free to non-profit institutions) owner by nrao and the nsf, aips++ will be in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with contributions from the us, canada, england, the netherlands, india, and australia to name a few. laboimage

image processing) is a powerful system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in interactive times. feature description disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options. all functions can be easily accessed via the disimp executive. this menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function. such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules. processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and ratioing. host configuration requirements running on unix workstations, disimp is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times. disimp is available in both runtime and programmer's environments. using the programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific applications programs. graphics are governed by an icon-based display panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image. manipulations of look up tables, colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control. a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of image, graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing. overlays of grids, text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery. the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help required. disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras. the purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of remote sensed data. for further information, please contact: the business manager, clough engineering group systems division, 627 chapel street, south yarra, australia 3141. telephone:

band data from a pass, automatic navigation, calibrate it to albedo and temp, convert that to byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically and carefree. it has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that difficult to write your own with their programmer's module. very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. been around for a number of years, sold to weather service and navy. runs on hp9000 with hp-ux. supports 24-bit display" hips ---- (human information processing laboratory's image processing system) michael landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil exploration, etc.). it is called hips, and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images. it has been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library. feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research, system development and teaching. it handles sequences of images (movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames. programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations, filtering, convolution, fourier and other transform processing, edge detection and line drawing manipulation, digital image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image statistics computation. over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed. as a result, almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally, hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines. new users become effective using hips on their first day. hips features images that are self-documenting. each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image. hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header, and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix ``filters''. it comes complete with source code, on-line manual pages, and on-line documentation. host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university, hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available. it runs under the unix operating system. it is modular and flexible, provides automatic documentation of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment. hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax, sun, apollo, masscomp, ncr tower, iris, ibm at, etc. for image display and input, drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage (ikonas) image processors, and the sun-2, sun-3, sun- 4, and sun-386i consoles. we also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx, sun console, matrox vip-1024, iti ip-512, lexidata, macintosh ii, x windowing system, and iris). the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs-4000. it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max- video. hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98% of hips is machine independent. availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system, both as an interactive research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. it is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel- to-reel or sun cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

thalmanns animation system from montreal. these are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ] mira stands for microcomputer image reduction and analysis. mira gives workstation level performance on 386/486 dos computers using svga cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768. mira contains a very handsome/functional gui which is mouse and keystroke operated. mira reads/writes tiff and fits formats, native formats of a number of ccd cameras, and uncompressed binary images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions. the result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. mira does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format. over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the intel hardware. the entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations. windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse. there are also smooth, real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. a wide selection of grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other palettes can be generated. supported functions include such niceties as the following: o image & image: + - / * interpolation o image & constant: + - / * o unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log, byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o convolutions/filters: laplacian, sobel edge operator, directional gradient, line, gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel. ellipse, rectangle, line, gradient, gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to any specified angle. o ccd data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to region target mean, median, or modal value. o create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image, collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of region of an image. o review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot keyword values for a set of images. o luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry, brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. interactive background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical aperture shape to image isophotes. o interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,` centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times, change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and adjust cursor size on image. select linear, log or gamma transfer function or histogram equalization. o interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for registration. o interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or 2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers can be cycled through. interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting, point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass back to calling function. dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars) to file or printer. change to user specified coordinate system. o tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to hp-pcl compatible printers (laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o documentation is over 300 pages in custom

application-level questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) send subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil. grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for grass programmers; system-level questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation of grass applications) send subscribe commands to grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil. both lists are maintained by the office of grass integration (subset of the army corps of engineers construction engineering research lab in champaign, il). the ogi is providing the lists as a service to the community; while ogi and cerl employees will participate in the lists, we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass through the list. if you have questions, problems, or comments, send e-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond. microstation imager ------------------- intergraph (based in huntsville alabama) sells a wide range of gis software/hardware. microstation is a base graphics package that imager sits on top of. imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy gis/remote sensing flavor. feature description basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine. rectification: affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image). rgb to ihs and ihs to rgb conversion. principal component analysis. classification: k-means and isodata. fourier xforms: forward, filtering and reverse. filters: high pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median, generic. complex histogram/contrast control. layer controller: manages up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc. the package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle very large images) and there is all kinds of other software available for gis applications. host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations (a unix machine similar to a sun) though there were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment. pci --- a company called pci, inc., out of richmond hill, ontario, canada, makes an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard" formats: lgsowg, bsq, landsat, and a couple of others whose titles i forget. the software is available in versions for ms-dos, unix workstations (among them hp, sun, and ibm), and vms, and quite possibly other platforms by now. i use the vms version. the "pci software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "pci database" disk file. the "tape i/o" package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats into, or write those formats out from, the "pci database" file; this is the only package i use or know much about. other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and god only knows what all else -- there's a lot. i don't have and don't use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for. each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from a common "parameter file" which must be (in vms anyway) in your "default directory." some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations. the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic, but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated, lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.) there's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the pci data structures (database file, parameter file). the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well. for instance, the tape i/o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band (what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different "interleave" orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry's "ct2t" format, would probably (i haven't tried) handle targa, and so on. above all, however, you have to know what you're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over. it's worth noting that the pci "database" file is designed to contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of other information (i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this can go into the pci "database"). i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used. on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems (the name gould/deanza seems to come to mind). one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci "database" file to a peritek vct-q (q-bus 24-bit directcolor) display subsystem. pci software could be "overkill" in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end" applications/users, i.e. those for whom a mac/pc largely doesn't suffice (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). it's probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada, a country which does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing; i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas. spam (spectral analysis manager) -------------------------------- back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer) which uses much larger images. spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, pc and ihs transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement (stretching). spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering. the original spam uses x or sunview to display. the aviris version may require vicar, an executive based on tae, and may also require a frame buffer. i can refer you to people if you're interested. pcw requires x for display. map ii ------ among the mac gis systems, map ii is distributed by john wiley. clrview ------- clrview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real-time capabilities of silicon graphics iris computers. this program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from cad and gis sources. it supports the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as dxf, tin, dem, lattices, and arc/info coverages among others. clrview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) in the directory pub/sgi/clrview. contact: rodney hoinkes head of design applications centre for landscape research university of toronto tel: (416) 978-7197 email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca ========================================================================== end of resource listing -- nick (nikolaos) fotis national technical univ. of athens, greece home: 16 esperidon st., internet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr halandri, gr - 152 32 uucp: mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis athens, greece fax: (+30 1) 77 84 578

hi! everyone, since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 4 points, i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset. for example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find the original ellipse analytically? i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year, but i failed. under the pressure, i had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately. any ideas will be greatly appreciated. please post here, let the others share our interests. yeh usc

i am working on a project where we are going to be including both still and moving grapics within a database. of course jpeg and mpeg come to mind as the formats of choice for the various files. however, from what i read on the net, it seems as if there are several different forms of each of these. what i want to do, is settle on a file format which i can count on as being a standard format 10 years from now. i know apple is going to support quicktime on the new power pc's and, so this may be the format of choice. what format does apple's quicktime use for their products? i guess it is some kind of mpeg for their motion picture. is it any different than standard mpeg files? thanx for any info! art. pollarda@xray.byu.edu

archive-name: jpeg-faq last-modified: 18 april 1993 this faq article discusses jpeg image compression. suggestions for additions and clarifications are welcome. new since version of 3 april 1993: * new versions of image archiver and pmjpeg for os/2. this article includes the following sections: [1] what is jpeg? [2] why use jpeg? [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? [4] how well does jpeg compress images? [5] what are good "quality" settings for jpeg? [6] where can i get jpeg software? [6a] "canned" software, viewers, etc. [6b] source code [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? [8] how does jpeg work? [9] what about lossless jpeg? [10] why all the argument about file formats? [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? [12] what about arithmetic coding? [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? sections 1-6 are basic info that every jpeg user needs to know; sections 7-14 are advanced info for the curious. this article is posted every 2 weeks. you can always find the latest version in the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27). by ftp, fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq; or if you don't have ftp, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with body "send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq". many other faq articles are also stored in this archive. for more instructions on use of the archive, send e-mail to the same address with the words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on separate lines. if you don't get a reply, the server may be misreading your return address; add a line such as "path myname@mysite" to specify your correct e-mail address to reply to. ---------- [1] what is jpeg? jpeg (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. jpeg is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. it does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings. jpeg does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression. standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named jbig and mpeg respectively. jpeg is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in. the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark. thus, jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans. if you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye. a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters. this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality. you can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc. conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. [2] why use jpeg? there are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.) if your viewing software doesn't support jpeg directly, you'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even with a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance). thus, using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. it's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. i'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today. furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard. [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? jpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images, gif is superior in image quality, file size, or both. one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to. as a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. jpeg is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.) gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif. jpeg can't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form. (in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they should be avoided in jpeg files.) jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc. the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't jpeg it. computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it. the same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg. you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not. if you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do. (section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. if you start from a gif, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg can only make things worse.) however, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. if you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints. be prepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not convert well. [4] how well does jpeg compress images? pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b. file	 size in bytes		comments ship.ppm	1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.z	 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (see sec. 7.) ship.jpg95	 155622 cjpeg -q 95 (highest useful quality setting) 			 this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	 58009 cjpeg -q 75 (default setting) 			 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	 38406 cjpeg -q 50 			 this has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been jpeged without seeing 			 the original. still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	 25192 cjpeg -q 25 			 jpeg's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 still, i've seen plenty of usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! in this case jpeg can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif, better if you have a full-color display). this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] what are good "quality" settings for jpeg? most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. "quality 95" does not mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. the default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice. this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. except for experimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality. if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand, you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation. the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg. the default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info). if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art". (note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it. other jpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.) [6] where can i get jpeg software? most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp. if you don't know how to use ftp, see the faq article "how to find sources". (if you don't have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body. the "anonymous ftp list faq" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. note: this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive. [6a] if you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc: the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. if you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. x windows: john bradley's free xv (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and other image formats. it's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu. the file is called 'xv-???.tar.z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn. xv reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color). also, you shouldn't use xv to convert full-color images to jpeg, because they'll get color-quantized first. but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg. caution: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry. another good choice for x windows is john cristy's free imagemagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z. this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software. both of the above are large, complex packages. if you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. the next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. ms-dos: this covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings. one good choice is eric praetzel's free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files. the current version, 2.4a, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip. this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. the user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei's hiview. the current version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and os/2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. for larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). you may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30). this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview, at least on my hardware. (for images larger than screen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. requires a vesa graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver, so don't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing.) a second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but i don't know any stable archive location for it. the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time. the well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest revision, 8.60a. however, cshow's jpeg implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware, $25. available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you have hi-color hardware, don't use gif as the intermediate format; try to find a targa-capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) the independent jpeg group's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will convert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats. handmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif. these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg. the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format. since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability. version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. note: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is not readable on non-pc platforms. handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images. a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip. note about simtel20: the internet's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>". if you are not physically on milnet, you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives; most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics". if you have no ftp capability, you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is. microsoft windows: there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images. (windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware, due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window.) the newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. but it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... jview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can't create new jpeg files, and it doesn't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. the current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) winjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (this is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) colorview is another shareware entry ($30). this was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.) dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. os/2: the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip image archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface. strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows (see description in windows section). shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip pmview 0.84: jpeg/gif/bmp viewer. gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing fast if you have huge amounts of ram, otherwise about the same speed as the above programs. strong 24-bit display support. shareware, $20. macintosh: most mac jpeg programs rely on apple's jpeg implementation, which is part of the quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed. to use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later. (if you're running system 6, you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.) you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways. with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.) mac users should keep in mind that quicktime's jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for details.) if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format. most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. the first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format. it also can convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. requires system 7 and quicktime. on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac. given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) some people like this behavior, some don't. overall, jpegview's user interface is very well thought out. gifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and pict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later. gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. also, the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it's faster with quicktime.) note: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version. jpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. this will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer. previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert. apple's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and gif format, and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime. some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse, pictpixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie, called pictcompressor, floating around the net. if you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.) storm technology's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter. this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can't use it.) you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it. if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance), gifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing. if you don't want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer. more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format. adobe photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu). you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it. amiga: (most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. it's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm, and gif images. the program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (note: although this directory is supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under amigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) viewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer. the current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha. if you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24 and viewtek. these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and imagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro), from asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas. imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support. the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats. the amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). among these are "augjpeg", "newamyjpeg", "vjpeg", and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion, anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. atari st: the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats. i have not heard of any free or shareware jpeg-capable viewer for ataris, but surely there must be one by now? pointers appreciated. acorn archimedes: !changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg, although this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking. recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg, along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede, the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). there's also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. contact: dt software, freepost, cambridge, uk. tel: 0223 841099. portable software for almost any system: if none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you'll also need a viewer program. if your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image files. there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6b] if you are looking for source code to work with: free, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group, which i lead. a package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. the "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp. if you are on a pc and don't know how to cope with .tar.z format, you may prefer zip format, which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on compuserve, in the graphsupport forum (go pics), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. if you have no ftp access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (if you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the faq article "how to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.) the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg "jfif" format and image files in gif, pbmplus ppm/pgm, utah rle, and truevision targa file formats. the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. the package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays. we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg-related products. we do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details). we hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. this process is called "color quantization". (this is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term. we're stuck with the standard usage though.) clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings). since jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for *all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. this happens because jpeg's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see posted images described as "256-color jpeg". this tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif. jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for jpeg.) on the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) for purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. this is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. for this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. jpeg's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg images you already have. with a gif, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. it's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes, etc. for these people, gif is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively. thus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] how does jpeg work? the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. this article's long enough already, so i'm not going to say more than that here. for technical information, see the comp.compression faq. this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. if you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] what about lossless jpeg? there's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. however, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg algorithm, and it offers much less compression. at present, very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial. saying "-q 100" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image. what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. at this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a huffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] why all the argument about file formats? strictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of official standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems. they have defined two jpeg-based file formats: * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a "low-end" format that transports pixels and not much else. * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). tiff is a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff. it's not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff/jpeg is well defined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable. a particular case that people may be interested in is apple's quicktime software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand; see section 11 for details. another particular case is handmade software's programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format. by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by hsi. this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings. use the -j switch to get jfif output. (this applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.) [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won't read, it's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format. you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'jfif'. 2. if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a "raw jpeg" file. this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you're out of luck unless you have hsi software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they won't decompress properly with non-hsi programs. 4. a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it. 5. anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all. if you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream. if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8), try stripping off everything before that. in uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is 	"begin" line 	m_]c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with 	"begin" line 	m:'-i ... if you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files. [12] what about arithmetic coding? the jpeg spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. the choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.) unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi. thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (the "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) at least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. in particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet. there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. stay tuned for further details. [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? it would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. unfortunately this is not the case. in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical jpeg file. even this is not true; at least, not with the current free jpeg software. it's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it. in any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (if you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format (ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? as stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from, it's far better to make a jpeg from that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif. (so check the sizes too.) experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation. don't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also, don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image. while useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges). do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows system, xv's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher q setting may not be necessary.) color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store. if you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the trouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and jpeg can't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it). to get around this, you want to "smooth" the gif image before compression. smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. try "-smooth 10" or so when converting gifs. values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs. heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. if you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol... the upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. -- 			tom lane 			organizer, independent jpeg group internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	bitnet: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie

i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working code, which i will also include. the intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in graphics gems i doesn't work. i may be misinterpreting, of course. i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better. in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations). to get the planes, i was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, p1 to p2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from p1 to p2. these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems. however, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests). my matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like i need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine i don't have (but should be easy to find). another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there. this would also define the circle center. however, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect. supposedly 3 planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel. ed thanks to all who answered so far. -- ed bolson university of washington cardiovascular research (206)543-4535 bolson@u.washington.edu (preferred) bolson@max.bitnet bolson@milton.u.washington.edu (if you must)

let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything. on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known. now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using yaron danon's excellent digitize program). that is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse. upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values. this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you. the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory. so the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion? in particular, if i have three sets of points reference(x,y) (the known true values) distortedreference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors) distorteddata(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors) what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors. i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove the errors in the other data points. any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems? thanks, earl

	about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult. i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published solutions to it. 	the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines. for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space. to draw the object we 1) fit a cubic spline through the points. each spline is effectively 	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve. each spline has an equal number of segments. we assume 	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not 	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable 	measure. 2) take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment 	of the opposing spline. use the pair of segments to form two 	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) depth sort the triangles 4) take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2d pixmap, draw 	and color the triangle. take the edge of the triangle that is 	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge 	colored with a special "edge color" 	it is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem. the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface. the reasons for this are fairly complicated. they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines. if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area. -thanks

hello again netters, 	i finally received the information about imagine for the pc. they are presently shipping version 2.0 of the software and will release version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say). the upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00. to purchase imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling. it requires a pc with 4 megs a math coprocessor, and dos 5.0 or up and a microsoft mouse and svga card. 	thanks for all your replies about the product. i have received many contrasting replies, but once i scrounge the money together, i think i will take the plunge. thanks again. 	here is the info for impulse if you want to find out more or get the sheet they sent. 	impulse inc. 	8416 xerxes avenue north 	minneapolis, mn 55444 	1-800-328-0184 thanks again for all your replies. scott -- scott snowiss sasst11+@.pitt.edu --turn on...jack in...jack out...

i'm looking for any information on detecting and/or calculating a double point and/or cusp in a bezier curve. an algorithm, literature reference or mail about this is very appreciated, ferdinand.
	getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks. the standard vga and ega outputs are very different than the ntsc format used by televisions. while there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit. 	if you have access to an amiga computer, that has an ntsc output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output. unfortunately, this would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program. 	otherwise, see if your local public access cable station has equipment that you can use.

hi! everyone, because no one has touched the problem i posted last week, i guess my question was not so clear. now i'd like to describe it in detail: the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. in other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere. this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? the answer is no! ironically, dmis - an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse. so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong. the software was also sold internationaly. imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! how many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? and most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used? i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem. i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical. i am now wondering if i didn't touch the base and make things complicated. please give me a hint. i know you may argue this is not a cg problem. you are right, it is not. however, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits". why not an ellipse? and why not its offset? please post here and let the others share our interests (i got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers). yeh usc

	hi, 	i have a problem, i hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve. 	background of the problem: 	i have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e the mesh is a 	mapping of a 3d bezier patch into 2d. the area in this domain 	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. the trimming 	loop is a set of 2d bezier curve segments. 	for the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells. 	my problem is this : 	the trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller 	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. if a cell 	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole , 	else it is trivially rejected. 	does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 	somewhere for doing this. 	any help would be appreciated. 	thanks, 	ani. -- to get irritated is human, to stay cool, divine.

the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not necessarily rectangular) as a window. my problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons" from the first one. is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon??? is there a simpler way?? comments welcome. noel.

(article 7716) 	the article included source code in turbo pascal with inline assembly language. 	i have been unable to find an archive for this newsgroup, or a current email address for joshua c. jensen. 	if anyone has the above details, or a copy of the code, could they please let me know.	many thanks. 					yours gratefully, etc. myles. -- myles strous	|	email: myles.strous@lib.monash.edu.au raytracing fan	|	phone: +61.51.226536 "got the same urgent grasp of reality as a cardboard cut-out. proud to have him on the team." archchancellor mustrum ridcully, in reaper man by terry pratchett

i am trying to convert an m-motion (ibm) video file format yuv to rgb data... the y portion is a byte from 0-255 the v is a byte -127-127 the color is u and v and the intensity is y does anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs ? can someone tell me where to get info on the u and v of a television signal ? if you need more info reply at the e-mail address... basically what i am doing is converting a digital ntsc format to rgb (vga) for displaying captured video pictures. thanks. the u is a byte -127-127
i would like to program tseng et4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by switching to standard 1024x768 mode using bios and than changing some timing details (0x3d4 registers 0x00-0x1f) but i don't know how to select 36 mhz pixel clock i need. the bios function selects 40 mhz. is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this. i am also interested in any other technical information about tseng et4000 and trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets. 			thanks very much 						pavel zemcik 						dept. of comp. sci. & eng. 						technical university of brno 						bozetechova 2 				 cs-612 66 brno 						czech republic 						e-mail: zemcik@dcse.fee.vutbr.cs
hello netters! i have a fairly weak question to ask everybody in netland. i've looked though the last faq for comp.graphics but i didn't find my answer. thus the post. i'll keep it short. question: how do i display any raster files, gif files, iff or tiff images that i have on my "root window" or background? i have a sun ipc, openwindows 3.0, sun os 4.1.3 if that helps any. i've compiled pov for the sun and would like to display some of the work i have done as a background/tile. thanks for any help or information that you provide. have a good day. scott fleming osi p.s. kudo's to the people who provided pov, its great!
g'day all, can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/ display hdf image files ? i've had a look at the hdf stuff under ncsa and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage approaches and minimalist documentation :-) part of the problem is that i want to look at large (5mb+) hdf files and crop out a section. ideally i would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from which i can then use the pbmplus stuff quite merrily. i can convert the cropped part into another format for viewing/animation. otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the ncsa visualisation s/w for hdf (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. this is for suns with sunos 4.1.2. any help greatly appreciated. ta muchly ! cheers, 	markus -- markus buchhorn, parallel computing research facility email = markus@octavia.anu.edu.au australian national university, canberra, 0200 , australia.

i have a paradise svga with 1mb, the 90c030 chip (1d). the docs say that i can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols if i have the ramdac hicolor chip. i have checked the board and i do have such a chip. now, the problem is that i can't get this mode to work ! graphics workshop 6.1 claims that it can display 24 bit images dithered down to 15 bit colour with my board, but it doesn't work. i have tried writing some assembler code to get the modes working and i have found out that each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ), but only the lower 8 bits are considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode, the 640x480 mode refuses to work i.e. remains in text mode ). could someone please help me. tristan

(1) no explicit (c) is necessary. if it the image is attributed to the geosphere company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been given to reprint. (2) unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals. however, "interesting" images do make their way into ads and computer demos. that is when a pirate might get some flak. this image is considered so "interesting" that many people would like to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there is lots of temptation. (3) one mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery- is not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be. not true. a new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected. this image is certainly fits such, since no one else has taken the tremendous effort to re-create it themselves. precedent is a recent telephone book court case. ma bell tried to copyright the data in their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are trick entries in the book). but the court only permitted copyright of the expression of the data, and not the data themselves. (you cant xerox and sell the telephone book.)

[please, note the newsgroups.] recent discussion about xv's problems were held in some newsgroup. here is some text users of xv might find interesting. i have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago. i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can, so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving. (i have also minor ideas for 24bit xv, e-mail me for them.) any misundertanding of mine is understandable. juhana kouhia ==clip== [ ..deleted..] note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too. this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago. imho, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. there's two errors: -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of original 24bit should be a special case -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases in saving the image, if at all) ==clip== ==clip== [ ..deleted..] it is limit of *xv*, but not limit of design. it is error in design. it is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that. as matter of fact, i'm sure when xv were designed 24bit displays were known. it is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. that were not done and now we have -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format) -the program has human interface errors. otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use. [ ..deleted.. ] ==clip== some new items follows. ==clip== i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. the reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant. if you remember, i have tested some quantizers. in that test i found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts. i don't know is ppmquant improved any, but i expect no. so, use of xv's -best24 option is not very good idea. i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- i'm sure rle-people gives permission. (another could be one used in imagemagick; i have not tested it, so i can say nothing about it.) ==clip== ==clip== some minor bugs in human interface are: key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete. also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed. often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when i'm writing something with editor or such. those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird. in the color editor, when i turn a color meter and release it, xv updates the images. it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image. it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. i suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done. ==clip==

i am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters. also, the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe world. to do this, i am thinking of using the srgp package described in the van dam, foley and feiner book, but i was wondering if there was another pd graphics package out there which was faster. i would like to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides satisfactory real time performance on a sun ipx. ideally, i'm looking for a pd graphics package which will allow me to open a new window under x, and allow me to draw lines within the window. also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven interaction handling since the user is going to move around the wireframe models using the keyboard. if you know or wrote such a package, i would be grateful if you could direct me to a ftp site which contains the package. thank you. -- =============================================================================== yong su kim, class of 1993		| internet: yk4@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu columbia college, columbia university | or ykim@cs.columbia.edu

	------------------------------------- 	+ ............the otis project '93 + 	+ "the operative term is stimulate" + 	------------------------------------- 	---this file last updated..4-21-93--- what is otis? otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny, and distribution. digital immortality. the basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever. the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future. perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up. if that doesn't interest you... otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors. suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts. keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for. --------------------------------------------------------------- where? otis currently (as of 4/21/93) has two ftp sites. 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the uwi site 		 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/otis), the sunsite 	(you can also gopher to this site for otis as well) merely "anonymous ftp" to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory. don't forget to get busy and use the "bin" command to make sure you're in binary. otis has also been spreading to some dial-up bbs systems around north america....the following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff... 	underground cafe (omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines 	cyberden (sanfran?) (415.472.5527) usenet waffle-iron -------------------------------------------------------------- how do you contribute? what happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either ftp-put it in the contrib/incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email. after the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory. computer originated works are also welcome. otis' directories house two types of image files, gif and jpg. gif and jpg files require, oddly enough, a gif or jpg viewer to see. these viewers are available for all types of computers at most large ftp sites around internet. jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find. if you can't find one, but do have a gif viewer, you can obtain a jpg-to-gif conversion program which will change jpg files to a standard gif format. otis also accepts animation files. when you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view. also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works. you can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing). if you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope. merely send copies to: the otis project c/o ed stastny po bx 241113 omaha, ne 68124-1113 i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them. include an ample sase if you want your stuff back. also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put. if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well. conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things. if you want to submit your works by disk, peachy. merely send a 3.5" disk to the above address (omaha) and a sase if you want your disk back. this is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or ftp, but do have access to a scanner. we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format. if possible, please submit image files as gif or jpg. if you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to. at senders request, we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand. even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an sase (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-otis. as of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing. email me for current archive size and directory. -------------------------------------------------------------------- distribution? the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another). in fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such. if you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images. it would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs. i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is. it's the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible. if you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite bbs system....or even just post this "info-file" there. it would be keen of you. -------------------------------------------------------------------- use? if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit). you will either find this in the ".rm" file for the image or series of images...or in the "artists" directory under the artists name. if permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it. if no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and i'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. when you do use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files. --------------------------------------------------------------------- naming images? please keep the names of your files in "dos" format. that means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less. the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number. thus, leonardo devinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like: 	ldmek5.gif or ldmek5.jpg or ldmech5.gif etc keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- creating image files? when creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture. this gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you. you may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- hmmm?! that's about it for now. more "guidelines" will be added as needed. your input is expected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- disclaimer: the otis project has no connection to the church of otis 	 (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest, 	 or ezine administrator. we do take sacrifices and donations 	 however. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- disclaimer: the otis project is here for the distribution of original 	 image files. the files will go to the public at large. 	 it's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone 	 could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain. 	 unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal. otis 	 takes no responsibility for this. in simple terms, all rights 	 revert to the author/artist. to leave an image on otis is to 	 give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 	 electronically. if you don't want your images distributed 	 all-over, don't upload them. to leave an image on otis is 	 not giving permission to have it used in any publication or 	 broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 	 limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software, 	 screen-printed clothing, etc). you must give specific 	 permission for this sort of usage. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- remember, the operative term is "stimulate". if you know of people that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm in the booty....offer them free food...whatever... ....e (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu) (ed@sunsite.unc.edu) -- ed stastny | otis project, end process, sound news and arts po bx 241113	 | ftp: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/otis) omaha, ne 68124-1113 | 141.214.4.135 (projects/otis) ---------------------- email: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu

our shop uses a package called cadcore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. the problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the cadcore package, a header is added to the .hrf file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. we would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations. so, here are my questions: (1) what is the hitachi format? - i need this format so i can recognize precisely what to strip out. i strongly suspect that it's a compressed format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header. (2) are there any unix packages that read and recognize hrf? it would be really nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;) i've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain graphics formats documentation, with no luck. so, if you know, or knwo someone who knows - please email! thanks.

i've got an old demo disk that i need to view. it was made using rix softworks. the files on the two diskette set end with: .scf the demo was vga resolution (256 colors), but i don't know the spatial resolution. first problem: when i try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that cut across (horizontally) the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the screen. the bars are about 1-inch wide. other than this, the demo (the animation part) seems to be running fine. second problem: i can't find any graphics program that will open and display these files. i have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention .scf files. the system i am using: 486clone, diamond speedstar 24, sony monitor. any suggestions? thank you, t. castro tlc@cx5.com

yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal. version 2 did it quite well, apart from a few hassles with radial fills. version 3 revb is better but if you try to export in scodal with a bitmap image included in the drawing it will say something like "cannot export scodal with bitmap"- at least it does on my version. if anyone out there knows a way around this i am all ears. temporal images make a product called filmpak which converts autocad plots to scodal, postscript to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs $650 and i was just wondering if there was anything out there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad cheaper. jeff lyall inst.geo.&.nuc.sci.ltd lower hutt new zealand

printer model and specification: canon clc 500 (color laser copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit) hello, we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network. the copier/printer has both a parallel and scsi interface. i have configured the printer with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer. i can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter. the canon clc 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable. we create the postscript files with a variaty of programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops. when we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable. note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript. we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality pictures. we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the scsi port. to my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a warranty. the management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work. here my questions: if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or parallel port? what is the quality of the printouts? is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts? what is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer? the big question: where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer? please email directly to me, i don't not read news on a regular basis. i will post a summary. thanks in advance. -- 	e-mail:		scott@ncifcrf.gov ,phone #:	(301) 846-5798 title: 	sr. systems manager/analyst

greetings, i have an epson hi-80 4 pen plotter forsale. it emulates an hp 7570 or 7574 - i'm not sure which. it has an option board on it that does the emulation. it has a serial interface with hardware handshake. i also have 340 pens for it as follows: 10 packs of 4 black oil based, 16 packs of 4 red,green, blue, and black pens, 22 packs of 4 aqueous black, 7 packs of 4 aqueous r,g,blue,black, 1 pack of 6 aqueous multi color pens, and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored. the plotter is used. i have tested it using the windows drivers for hp 7570 and hp 7574 and both worked fine. it accepts either a or b sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17). i figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at least another $200 more.. one thing is certain, you won't need to purchase any pens for quite a while... all of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh. the rest were capped and seem to function as well. i'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them. i'm selling it because i got a hp laserjet and i don't need color. i'd like $350 or best offer... -chert -- chert pellett - chert@dungeon.cirr.com || chert@dungeon.lonestar.org panic: the cat is nibbling on the power cord!

there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters. the points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius r and center (a,b,c) can be written as (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2 this equation can be rewritten into the following form: 2ax + 2by + 2cz + r^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 approximate the left hand part by f(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1 for all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |f(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2. in 'numerical recipes in c' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters. the best fitting sphere will have - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2) - radius r = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c). so, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations i think ?. quick van rijt, rytg7@fel.tno.nl

i have posted disp135.zip to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities ****** you may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use if no fee is gained. ****** there is no warranty. the author is not responsible for any damage caused by this program. important changes since version 1.30: fix bugs in file management system (file displaying). improve file management system (more user-friendly). fix bug in xpm version 3 reading. fix bugs in targa reading/writng. fix bug in gem/img reading. add support for pcx and gem/img writing. auto-skip macbinary header. (1) introduction: this program can let you read, write and display images with different formats. it also let you do some special effects(rotation, dithering ....) on image. its main purpose is to let you convert image among different formts. include simple file management system. support 'slide show'. there is no limit on image size. currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. if you want to use hicolor or truecolor, you must have vesa driver. if you want to modify video driver, please read section (8). (2) hardware requirement: pc 386 or better. msdos 3.3 or higher. min amount of ram is 4m bytes(maybe less memory will also work). (i recommend min 8m bytes for better performance). hard disk for swapping(virtual memory). the following description is borrowed from djgpp. supported wares: * up to 128m of extended memory (expanded under vcpi) * up to 128m of disk space used for swapping * supervga 256-color mode up to 1024x768 * 80387 * xms & vdisk memory allocation strategies * vcpi programs, such as qemm, desqview, and 386max unsupported: * dpmi * microsoft windows features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory model, svga graphics. (3) installation: video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from djgpp. (if you use western digital vga chips, read readme.wd) (this go32.exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible with original version) + *** but some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with + other djgpp programs in their system. if you encounter this problem, + don't put go32.exe within search path. *** please read runme.bat for how to run this program. if you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment go32. for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256 if you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment go32. for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387 **** notes: 1. i only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn. other drivers are not tested. 2. i have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. you don't need to use vesa driver. if et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn. 3. for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display, please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users). you can find vesa bios driver from : wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/graphics godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au: /kjb/mgl (4) command line switch: + usage : display [-d|--display initial_display_type] + [-s|--sort sort_method] + [-h|-?] display type: 8(svga,default), 15, 16(hicolor), 24(truecolor) + sort method: 'name', 'ext' (5) function key: f2 : change disk drive + ctrl-a -- ctrl-z : change disk drive. f3 : change filename mask (see match.doc) f4 : change parameters f5 : some effects on picture, eg. flip, rotate .... f7 : make directory t : tag file + : tag group files (see match.doc) t : tag all files u : untag file - : untag group files (see match.doc) u : untag all files ins : change display type (8,15,16,24) in 'read' & 'screen' menu. f6,m,m : move file(s) f8,d,d : delete file(s) r,r : rename file c,c : copy file(s) z,z : display first 10 bytes in ascii, hex and dec modes. + f,f : display disk free space. page up/down : move one page tab : change processing target. arrow keys, home, end, page up, page down: scroll image. home: left most. end: right most. page up: top most. page down: bottom most. in 'screen' & 'effect' menu : left,right arrow: change display type(8, 15, 16, 24 bits) s,s : slide show. escape to terminate. alt-x : quit program without prompting. + alt-a : reread directory. escape : abort function and return.

(7) detail: initialization: set default display type to highest display type. find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only). 1. when you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. whthin this menu you can press any function key except f5. if you move or copy files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like 'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. + the header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)". + d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files. pressing space in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use for reading current file. pressing return in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. this program will automatically determine which format this file is. the procedure is: first, check magic number. if fail, check standard extension. still fail, report error. pressing s or s in 'read' menu will do 'slide show'. if delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key (except escape). if any error occurs, program will make a beep. escape to terminate. pressing ins in 'read' menu will change display type. pressing alt-x in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. 2. once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu. within this menu f5 is turn on. you can do special effect on image. pressing return: show image. in graphic mode, press return, space or escape to return to text mode. pressing tab: change processing target. this program allows you to do special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image. pressing left,right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits. pressing space: save current image to file. b/w dither: save as black/white image(1 bit). grey scale: save as grey image(8 bits). full color: save as color image(8 bits). true color: save as 24-bit image. this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to file. some questions are format-dependent. finally this program will prompt you a filename. if you want to save file under another directory other than current directory, please press space. after pressing space, you will enter 'write2' menu. you can change directory to what you want. then, pressing space: this program will prompt you 'original' filename. pressing return: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename (filename under bar). 3. this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. 4. this program is memory greedy. if you don't have enough memory, the performance is poor. 5. if you want to save 8 bits image : try gif then tiff(lzw) then targa then sun raster then bmp then ... if you want to save 24 bits image (lossless): try tiff(lzw) or targa or ilbm or sun raster (no one is better for true 24bits image) 6. i recommend jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images. 7. not all subroutines are fully tested 8. this document is not well written. if you have any problem, suggestion, comment about this program, please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13). i need your suggestion to improve this program. (there is no anonymous ftp on this site) (8) tech. information: program (user interface and some subroutines) written by jih-shin ho. some subroutines are borrowed from xv(2.21) and pbmplus(dec 91). tiff(v3.2) and jpeg(v4) reading/writing are through public domain libraries. compiled with djgpp. you can get whole djgpp package from simtel20 or mirror sites. for example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp (9) for thoese who want to modify video driver: 1. get grx source code from simtel20 or mirror sites. 2. for hicolor and truecolor: 15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768. 16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010. 24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018. acknowledgment: i would like to thank the authors of xv and pbmplus for their permission to let me use their subroutines. also i will thank the authors who write tiff and jpeg libraries. thank dj. without djgpp i can't do any thing on pc. jih-shin ho u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw

for some reason i never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a pc, you really can't go past the mode x stuff from dr dobbs. this code is all p.domain (as far as i know), and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga routines, and then optimised to modex with some interesting discussion along the way. if you are interested, i could find out more details of the issues in question, (i have them at home). bernard.

i bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago. it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations. it runs graphics and animation as well as some near full motion video very well. the only thing i can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors. its qualit in between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly compromise speed. it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes with some great software, but im not so sure about the excelerator part. i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster than that. one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver from rom at startup, (i think) because i have never had to load it for links386 or any other programs that require special vesa drivers at startup. gromi a16pd hintmatt@ba.ba.isu.edu --

**************************** sphinx *************************** 	sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance computer platforms operating unix and the x-window system. 	it was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques. 		 intuitive graphic interface 	sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast. 	this accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations. 		 image format compatibility 	using smart read/write functions, sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values. sphinx also reads and writes the common tiff and gif formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space. 		 image analysis & processing 	for image and pixel analysis, the sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations, such as fourier transforms, convolution product or principal component analyses. an interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. standard fortran notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions. 		 satellite spectra & orbit analysis 	sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., goes, meteosat, noaa, spot etc.). the simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. a geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-d image projection. 		 easy external program interfacing 	sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations. sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions. 		 quick quality presentation 	sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables. using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. sphinx's 2-d and 3-d graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as histograms and radial graphs. the package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers. 	other capabilities sphinx also performs image animation, external graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else? 		 software support & development 	 sphinx was developed at the laboratoire d'optique atmospherique (loa) of the universite de lille, france. the package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the french national laboratory, centre national de recherche scientifique (cnrs), and the french space agency, centre national d'etudes spatiales (cnes). at loa, sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology. the package, which features on-line help, is supported by an internet address sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without delay. 		 performance tested 	cnes has selected sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data collected during the upcoming adeos/polder satellite mission. today, the sphinx package is in use at the nasa - goddard space flight center and is widely used in many french laboratories, including the centre de recherche en physique de l'environnement, ecole normale superieure , laboratoire d' etudes et de recherches en teledetection spatiale, laboratoire de meteorologie dynamique. a test version of sphinx is available at loasil.citilille.fr (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd sphinx : get all_sphinx.tar.z) in the test version the output files are disable. however the visualisation and graphic functions are available. this is sufficient to work with. if you are interested in keeping "sphinx", send us your email and you will receive news about the package evolution. the software is changing with user suggestions we will appreciate your comments.

hi there i am very interested in rayshade 4.00. i have managed to make a chessboard for rayshade. unfortunately i still have to do the knight (horse). any ideas? i am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. the board is marble. unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. anybody with ideas for nice surfaces? i would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield command. unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and i don't have craig kolb's email address. anybody with ideas, because this is essential for my next venture into raytracing. where should i post the finished chessboard? is there anybody else using rayshade on non-unix systems? how fast does unix render? thanks rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no artistic talent.
hello, i'm trying out the c++ graphics package interviews. besides the man pages on the classes, i haven't got any documentation. is there anything else around? furthermore, can anyone send me a (small!) example program which shows how to use these classes together ? i would be very gratefull...

i'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to that used in populous. basically, you look into a room that looks similar to the following: xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx 3 /|\ xxxx xxxx /~\ xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*] since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage. in my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (i'm also using mode x, 320x240). i've run into two problems; i'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions: 1) the routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when i ran a packed->planar image through them, i was dismayed by the "jaggies." i'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden? 2) wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original. i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape? currently i take: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 and produce: 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 line 1 follows the slope. line 2 is directly under line 1. line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels. line 4 is under line 3. this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels. but it causes distortions. has anyone come up with a better way? perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed? are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. locations are stored in (x,y,z) form. [*] for those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines. this is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood). there are no vanishing points. this simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room). i've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing. hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity. thanks in advance for any help. -- till next time, \o/ \o/ v \o/ v email:pinky@tamu.edu <> sam inala <> v

i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature. this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices. the postscript literature explains the process to some extent. they also give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in postscript environments where it is absent. the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate: 	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 	 doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25". from reading i thought that what they might actually do is: 	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 	 this results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" whichever is closer. by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript, i find that neither of these is what dps really uses. since i like how the dps result looks better than how my stuff looks, i'd like to know if anyone who knows how dps does it is willing/able to tell me. thanks, --steve squeegee@world.std.com

i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type 1 or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3d scanline renderer. i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. well, i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end. the main problem i face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). for example, in the letter "o" there are two outlines: 	1) the outside outline which is clockwise (truetype font) 	2) the inside outline which is counterclockwise. one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. this is equivalent to descibing a "polygon with holes". the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges. i do not want to use this simplistic system since: 	1) it will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple 		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for 		some fancy fonts). 	2) it does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules. from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers). these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3d scanline renderer. my question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons. another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i can't tell which method is the best to implement. thanks for any pointers. --> rob lansdale -- robert lansdale - (416) 978-6619 dynamic graphics project	 internet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu computer systems research institute uucp: ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd university of toronto bitnet:	 lansd@dgp.utoronto toronto, ontario m5s 1a4, canada

hi all, i am looking into methods i can use to turn my linux based bbs into a full color graphical bbs that supports pc, mac, linux, and amiga callers. originally i was inspired by the naplps graphics standard (a summary of which hit this group about 2 weeks ago). following up on software availability of naplps supporting software i find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being pp3 which runs soley on msdos machines leaving mac and amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the bbs (i know i wouldn't) next most interesting possibility is to port mgr to pc, mac, amiga. i know there is an old version of a mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under system 7 but i can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if i can patch it. is there a color version of mgr for linux? i know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but i misplaced it. does anyone on this group know if mgr as been ported to pc or amiga ? i can't seem to send a message to the mgr channel without it bouncing. does anyone have any other suggestions for a linux based gui bbs ? thanks in advan

hi guys. i am scanning in a color image and it looks fine on the screen. when i converted it into pcx,bmp,gif files so as to get it into ms windows the colors got much lighter. for example the yellows became white. any ideas? thanks dan csc3phx@vaxc.hofstra.edu

a shareware graphics program called pman has a filter that makes a picture look like a hand drawing. this picture could probably be converted into vector format much easier because it is all lines. (with corel trace, etc..)
hello, i've recently had povray draw about 10 sample files. the problem is that i accidently erased the command in my povray.def that made the image a targas file. so now the files are the dump format. how do i fix these files with out having to re-trace them? by fix i mean, turn them into targas. thanks in advance. -jerry -- ################################################################# jerry m. lineberry internet : lineber@lonestar.utsa.edu or compuserve : 71221,3015 #################################################################

ok, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime, the effects of scaling and so on, i thought i'd do some more tests. first of all, i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor). i decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse). i pulled out a copy of "2001: a space odyssey" that i had recorded off tv a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically, i digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. to increase the differences between frames, i digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames. i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a pal source). i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. i used the default "2.00" quality setting in premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames. i then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "raw speed test" program i used for the results i'd been reporting earlier. result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second. that's right, i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. just for fun, i copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a quantum lp105s), and ran it from there. this time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk (also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback. i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. i'd try my tests with quicktime 1.0, but i don't think it's entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1... unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps. the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime's normal synchronized playback). a preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. i can't believe that quicktime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system's task switching. a preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: i couldn't see any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 (=> 40 fps) i *think* i could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell. i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more... lawrence d'oliveiro fone: +64-7-856-2889 computer services dept fax: +64-7-838-4066 university of waikato electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz hamilton, new zealand 37^ 47' 26" s, 175^ 19' 7" e, gmt+12:00

(*) steve is no longer with us. he and his wife disappeared while on vacation in hawaii a couple of years after they graduated. their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area. while no bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods. -- roy smith <roy@nyu.edu> hippocrates project, department of microbiology, coles 202 nyu school of medicine, 550 first avenue, new york, ny 10016 "this never happened to bart simpson."

(you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.) i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons. this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier. the less than n sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made. thus for a high speed game application i think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons. >finding something like that are pretty remote, so i guess i'd need the source >with it. oh, and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise it'd be too >slow. i've seen some polygon routines in c, and they've all been waaay too >slow. its for a 3d vector graphics program. i've been hunting high and low it may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms. if you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be. >for a polyn function in asm, and i can't find one anywhere that i can use. >i've found one or two polyn functions, but my asm is pretty bad, so i won't >even try to rewrite them. :) >		//lucas.

"computer graphics: principles and practice," by foley, van dam, feiner, and hughes, to obtain text errata and information on distribution of the software packages described in the book. also, users can send the authors feedback, to report text errors and software bugs, make suggestions, and submit exercises. to receive information describing how you can use the mail handler, simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu and put the word "help" in the subject line. use the subject line "software-distribution" to receive information specifically concerning the software packages srgp and sphigs. errata for "an introduction to ray tracing" is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books/introtort.errata. errata for "digital image warping" is in the same directory as "digital-image-warping.errata". all c code from the "graphics gems" series is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu. look in the directory pub/graphics/graphicsgems for the various volumes (gems, gemsii, gemsiii), and get the readme file first. errata to _graphics gems_ and _graphics gems ii is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books. a list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing journals is available from juhana kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi. 2) drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen. the simple answer is, you divide by the depth. for a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with: the foley & van dam & feiner & hughes "computer graphics" book is certainly a good start. chapter 6 is "viewing in 3d", then read chapter 15, "visible-surface determination". for more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there. 3) quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits. find a copy of "color image quantization for frame buffer display" by paul heckbert, siggraph '82 proceedings, page 297. there are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple. implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below). a variant method is described in "graphics gems", p. 287-293. note that the code from the "graphics gems" series is all available from an ftp site, as described above. check out john bradley's "diversity algorithm", which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual. the imagemagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower". there's also an implementation of: wan, wong, and prusinkiewicz, _an algorithm for multidimensional data clustering_, transactions on mathematical software, vol. 14 #2 (june, 1988), pp. 153-162. avialable as princeton.edu:pub/graphics/colorquant.shar. this code, in modified form, appears in the utah raster toolkit as well. 4) converting color into grayscale. the ntsc formula is: luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue 5) quantizing grayscale to black&white. the only reference you need for this stuff is: digital halftoning, robert ulichney, mit press 1987, isbn 0-262-21009-6 but before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below. all of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion. 6) rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle. the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination. instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. this method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-d mapping, not just rotation. you can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling. however, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations. the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in pbmplus. reference: "a fast algorithm for raster rotation", by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphics interface '86 (vancouver). an article on the im toolkit appears in the same journal. an updated version of the rotation paper appears in "graphics gems" (see section [1]) under the original title. 7) free image manipulation software. there are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. here are pointers to some of them: xv by john bradley. x-based image display, manipulation, and format conversion package. xv displays many image formats and permits editing of gif files, among others. the program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.z on export.lcs.mit.edu. pbmplus, by jef poskanzer. comprehensive format conversion and image manipulation package. the latest version is always available via anonymous ftp as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.z, wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.z, and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.z. im raster toolkit, by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca). provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit. the format is versatile in supporting pixels of arbitrary channels, components, and bit precisions while allowing compression and machine byte-order independence. the kit contains more than 50 tools with extensive support of image manipulation, digital halftoning and format conversion. previously distributed on tape c/o the university of waterloo, an ftp version will appear someday. utah rle toolkit. conversion and manipulation package, similar to pbmplus. available via ftp as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, princeton.edu:pub/graphics/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*. fuzzy pixmap manipulation, by michael mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. conversion and manipulation package, similar to pbmplus. version 1.0 available via ftp as

displays on an x11 screen, and does some image manipulations. version 1.3 is available via ftp as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/img_1.3.tar.z, and venera.isi.edu:pub/img_1.3.tar.z along with a large collection of color images. xim, x image manipulator, by philip r. thompson. it does essential interactive image manipulations and uses x11r4 and the osf/motif toolkit for the interface. it supports images in 1, 8, 24 and 32 bit formats. reads/writes and converts to/from gif, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and other formats. writes level 2 postscript. other utilities and image application library are included. not a paint package. available via ftp from gis.mit.edu. xloadimage, by jim frost <madd@std.com>. reads in images in various formats and displays them on an x11 screen. available via ftp as export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xloadimage*, and in your nearest comp.sources.x archive. xli, by grame gill, is an updated xloadimage with numerous improvements in both speed and in the number of formats supported. available in the same places as xloadimage (contrib tape, comp.sources.x archives). tiff software, by sam leffler <sam@okeeffe.berkeley.edu>. nice portable library for reading and writing tiff files, plus a few tools for manipulating them and reading other formats. available via ftp as ucbvax.berkeley.edu:pub/tiff/*.tar.z or ftp.uu.net:graphics/tiff.tar.z xtiff, an x11 tool for viewing a tiff file. it was written to handle as many different kinds of tiff files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient. xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes. it is distributed as part of sam leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, ftp.uu.net and comp.sources.x. xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes xlib and xt versions. alv, a sun-specific image toolkit. version 2.0.6 posted to comp.sources.sun on 11dec89. also available via email to alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk. popi, an image manipulation language. version 2.1 posted to comp.sources.misc on 12dec89. imagemagick, an x11 package for display and interactive manipulation of images. includes tools for image conversion,

there are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message. see item 13 below for details on some. also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this. you may find useful information there. 8) format documents for tiff, iff, biff, nff, off, fits, etc. you almost certainly don't need these. read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software. get one or more of these packages and look through them. chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there. but if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats. these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. this archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats. the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as mark hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it. a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by quincey koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu). the latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats. apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both. fits stands for flexible image transport system. it's a file format most often used in astronomy. despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well. there is a regular monthly fits basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more. 9) converting between vector formats. a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw to cgm, or whatever. it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7. converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats. this is not so for vector formats. the basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats. there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp.psc.edu. the contributor states that it runs on unix, ms-windows, and possibly the mac. a better, more specific blurb would be most welcome. on the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. as far as i know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc. check the index on your nearest archive site. a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to x11 bitmap. for example, some of the commercial postscript clones for pc's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer. also, the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun's x11/news can be used to render to a file if you're clever. but in general, the answer is no. however, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial. gnu ghostscript (from the fsf - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter. (it implements essentially all of postscript level 1 and alot of display postscript and level 2). 10) how to get pixar films. the various john lasseter / pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape. you can order them from direct cinema limited: film individual price institutional price luxo, jr.				$14.95			$50.00 red's dream				$19.95			$75.00 tin toy				$24.95			$75.00 knickknack				$24.95			$75.00 luxo, jr./red's dream/tin toy	$39.95			$100.00 all tapes are on 1/2" vhs ntsc. add $10/tape for pal format. also available: tin toy t-shirt			$15.00 knickknack 3d t-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses) for individual orders, add $5 s&h for the first tape or shirt, $2 for each additional tape or shirt. for institutional orders, add $5 s&h for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape. foreign shipping, add $3/tape or shirt. call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international, 213-396-3233 fax) to charge to your credit card. call first to verify prices and availability. or, just write to: direct cinema limited 1749 14th street santa monica, ca 90404-4342 allan braunsdorf has this to say: at siggraph they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25. that was a sale price. you can get it for slightly more than that normally. ($35 maybe.) i believe it's available from renderman retail (at pixar's address). pixar 1001 west cutting blvd. richmond, ca. 94804 (510) 236-4000 (510) 236-0388 (fax) you can obtain a video directly from pixar which contains "luxo, jr.", "red's dream", "tin toy" and "knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. they will take your order over the phone or via fax with a major credit card. i ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. according to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented. 11) how do i draw a circle as a bezier (or b-spline) curve? the short answer is, "you can't." unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle. the approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale. magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies. deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large. if you want to do the job right, consult the article: "a menagerie of rational b-spline circles" by leslie piegl and wayne tiller in ieee computer graphics and applications, volume 9, number 9, september, 1989, pages 48-56. for rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book: computational geometry for design and manufacture by i. d. faux and m. j. pratt, ellis horwood publishers, halsted press, john wiley 1980. for the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article: "good approximation of circles by curvature-continuous bezier curves" by tor dokken, morten daehlen, tom lyche, and knut morken in computer aided geometric design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined), june, 1990, pages 33-41 [elsevier science publishers (north-holland)] 12) how to order standards documents. the american national standards institute sells ansi standards, and also iso (international) standards. their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 broadway, ny ny 10018. it helps if you have the complete name and number. some useful numbers to know: cgm (computer graphics metafile) is iso 8632-4 (1987). gks (graphical kernel system) is ansi x3.124-1985. phigs (programmer's hierarchical interactive graphics system) is ansi x3.144-1988. iges is asme/ansi y14.26m-1987. language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the gks fortran binding is x3.124.1-1985. standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!). ansi can let you know where to order them; most are available from global engineering at 1-800-854-7179. 13) how to ftp by email. there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system. you send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail. in addition, there is at least one ftp-by-mail server. send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use it. note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse. 14) how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon. consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity. if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon. if the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges. this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem; see eric haines' article in glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases. another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon. if the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside. however, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly. code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the ray tracing news, vol. 5, no. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/graphics/rtnews/rtnv5n3.z. 15) how to tessellate a sphere. one simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles. the base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones. jon leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. it's available for ftp on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu. 16) specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination. rick speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography: highlights of this edition- i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through november '91; ii) papers from all siggraph, graphics interface, eurographics, cg international and ausgraph proceedings through december, '91; iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup; iv) cross-indices by keyword and author; v) glossary of the 119 keywords used. the bib is in the form of a postscript file. the printout is 41 pages long. below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. it's named "speer.raytrace.bib.ps.z" and is compressed at most sites- site dir 	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/rt.bib.speer/ 	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/graphics/ 	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/ 	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics 	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/ eric haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies. these are in "refer" format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each). the bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/graphics/papers as "raybib.*" and "radbib.*". tom wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books. the information is essentially in plaintext, and latex and troff formatting programs are included. this collection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*". 17) siggraph information online [from steve cunningham and ralph orlick] acm-siggraph announces its online information site at siggraph.org (128.248.245.250). this site now provides siggraph information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server. the anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories. to retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. a good place to start is with the command send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information. 18) siggraph panels proceedings available [from steve cunningham and bob judd] acm siggraph announces the availability of the siggraph '91 panels proceedings at the siggraph.org site (128.248.245.250). the proceedings are available in three formats: text (ascii) rtf (rich text format, suitable for many word processors) word (ms word for the macintosh) they may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways: (1) by anonymous ftp change to one of the directories publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word] the text and rtf files may be downloaded in ascii mode, while the word files are stored in macbinary format and must be downloaded in binary mode. each directory contains a table of contents file (toc) that describes the contents of each panel file. (2) by electronic mail send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org you can retrieve either the text or rtf files. we suggest that you first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages send panel91-txt index send panel91-rtf index in the subject or body of the message. you will get the necessary information to retrieve the actual transcript files. 19) graphics mailing lists there are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic. i have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing. please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added. name:		imagine mailing list description:	discussion forum for users of the imagine 3d rendering and 		animation package by impulse, inc. platforms:	amiga, ibm subscription:	imagine-request@email.sp.paramax.com posting:	imagine@email.sp.paramax.com name:		dctv mailing list description:	discussion forum for users of the digital creations dctv 		box, software, and file formats platforms:	amiga subscription:	dctv-request@nova.cc.purdue.edu posting:	dctv@nova.cc.purdue.edu name:		rayshade users mailing list description:	discussion forum for users of the rayshade raytracer platforms:	most unix boxes, amiga, mac, ibm subscription:	rayshade-request@cs.princeton.edu posting:	rayshade-users@cs.princeton.edu name:		lightwave 3d software for toaster mailing list description:	discussion forum for users of lightwave, the video 		toaster modelling and rendering package platforms:	amiga subscription:	lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com 		with "subscribe lightwave-l" in your message posting:	lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com name:		pov mailing list description:	discussion forum for dkbtrace and pov renderers platforms:	unix subscription:	listserv@trearn.bitnet posting:	dkb-l@trearn.bitnet name:		mailing list for massive parallel rendering description:	same?

gif stands for graphics interchange format. it is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms. it is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the faq has some opinions after all), and in fact, i don't like it much. however, it looks to me like the most-frequently asked question which was not previously covered in this list. the following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about gif. subject: alt.binaries.pictures faq - general info subject: alt.binaries.pictures faq - os specific info newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc, 	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, 	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers available in the indicated usenet newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files: /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of: send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 send a message containing "help" to get general information about the mail server. also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information. 22) what is morphing? warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. valerie hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. this is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/morph. there are three files: morph_intro.ps.z (postscript version, many pictures - 1.5m) morph_intro.txt.z (text version) m_responses.z (responses to morphing questions) the files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards. 23) how to ray-trace height fields height fields are a special case in ray-tracing. they have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible. thus, they get their own faq section. note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above. the following paper seems to be the definitive reference: f. kenton musgrave grid tracing: fast ray tracing for height fields july, 1988 <musg88.ps.z> this is available as "research report yaleu/dcs/rr-639" from yale university, it's also in the siggraph '91 fractal modeling in 3d computer graphics and imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net: nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.z weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/papers/musg88.ms.z princeton.edu		pub/graphics/papers/musg88.ms.z coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.z gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/musg88.ms.z and musg88.ps.z an implementation of this paper may be found in rayshade. another paper exists: %a david w. paglieroni %a sidney m. petersen %t parametric height field ray tracing %j proceedings of graphics interface '92 %i canadian information processing society %c toronto, ontario %d may 1992 %p 192-200 and still one more: musgrave, kolb, and mace "the synthesis and rendering of eroded fractal terrains", computer graphics vol 23, no. 3 (siggraph '89 procedings) p. 41-50 24) how to find the area of a 3d polygon 	the area of a triangle is given by (in c notation), area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) - 	 ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) ); and the area of a planar polygon is given by area = 0.0; for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ ) area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] ); area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] ); area /= 2.0; if the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise. >from ronald golman's gem (in graphics gems ii - see section 1 above), "area of planar polygons and volume of polyhedra:" the area of a polygon p0, p1, p2, ... pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by area(polygon) = 1/2 * | n . sigma { pk x pk+1 } | where n is the unit vector normal to the plane and p is a polygonal vertex. the . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator. sigma represents the summation operator. | | represents the absolute value operator. pn+1 is equal to p0. 25) how to join acm/siggraph probably the easiest way to join acm/siggraph is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of communications of the acm. somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. fill it out and mail it in. acm membership for students costs $23.00, voting or associate membership $77.00 (yearly) siggraph student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for voting or associate members (also yearly). to get tog (transactions on graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for voting or associate members. if you just want to join siggraph without joining acm, it'll cost you $59.00 (no student discount). there are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications. acm member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. their phone number is (212) 626-0500. fax number (212) 944-1318. snailmail address: acm po box 12114 church street station new york, new york 10257 siggraph `93 will be held in anaheim, california, at the anaheim convention center (just up the street from disneyland) on august 1-6, 1993. 26) where can i find mri and ct scan volume data?

i am looking for a small utility that will convert a microsoft video (avi) file to an autodesk animator pro (flc) file. since avis also contain sound, it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a wav or voc file. currently i'm accomplishing this by saving the avi as multiple dibs using video for windows, then converting each dib to a gif, then loading the gifs into animator. for the sound, i load the original avi into wavedit and save it as a seperate wav file. this requires too many steps to be productive. any help will be greatly appreciated. thanks don -- don campbell internet: donc@cognos.com uucp: cognos!donc cognos inc. mail: p.o. box 9707, 3755 riverside drive, (613) 738-1440 ottawa ontario, canada. k1g 3z4
i do not know if i am hitting the right news groups or not, any help in the right direction is more than welcome. i need help finding a company that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by adobe photoshop and turn them into thermal prints or negatives. i am looking for a place as close to north carolina as possible. the images will be created on a macintosh quadra 800 running adobe photoshop and will then be stored in whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88m cartridges? the images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi scanner then modified/corrected by adobe photoshop. if anyone could help me or even give me phone numbers to people who could i would be very grateful. also if anyone else is doing what i am planning i would be happy to hear from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you use and/or any peripherals or software. it seemed the quadra 800 would be my best bet to modify photographic images. i am planning on buying a quadra 800 with 32megs of ram, a 510meg hard drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17" sony monitor and a 88meg cartridge drive and perhaps a cd rom. i am new to computers and any advice would be great. -- david at hawks@seq.uncwil.edu or hawks_dw@wl.corning.com

a good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have 2 * 24-bit planes. you write to the one in the background, and then flip! -- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. the screen updates in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order that they're drawn (as in the cad/macdraw effect). now your ready to update the image that used to be in the foreground. steve. (thssstb@iitmax.iit.edu / iris.iit.edu) about the sg product line: who can even keep track nowadays? every co. seems to (as their ads / press releases claim) redefine computing (etc. etc.) as we know it with each new product. progress and competition are great, but who wants to invest in a system that's obsolete by the time it reaches your desk? :-)

i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. the quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated by dithering. up to now i have used xv to process the images, but now i would like to automate the procedure. the problem is that xv can't (i think) convert images automatically, and the obvious alternative pnmplus (ppmquant and pnmdither) don't even get close to xv's quality. pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb, even though the images are in grayscale. the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image colors for the dither. is this or any similar routine available in the public domain? if so, where? -- niclas mattsson exjob-17@math.chalmers.se

i have a question about recursive, backward raytracing. when an incident ray (i) strikes an object at point p, first the normal (n) is calculated. light rays are calculated (l1 to ln where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light rays that do not intersect with anything. the reflected ray (r) and the transmitted ray (t) is calculated from the formulae. calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours along the rays (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object has its own colour ocol and each light source has licol (1 <= i <= n). the question is: how do you combine rcol, tcol, ocol and all the licol's to get the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray? all colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components between 0 and 1. if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints? -- adrian secchia asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za

dear netters: i am looking for c source code to test if a 3d point lies within a concave polyhadra. i have read a few articles about this and know that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. both ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. so i wonder if there exists public domain source code for this. another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (m. tamminen, et. al., 1984. "ray-casting and block model conversion using a spatial index". computer-aided-designs. 4, 1984, 60-65). but the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their normal pointing outside of polyhedra. how this could be done in practice ? i have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. how could i ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? the paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case. i have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal. it says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". again how to make sure ? any pointers are welcome ? yaohong jiang queen's university kingston, ont. jiangy@qucdn.queensu.ca
i need triangulized data of some nice looking model with some texture mapping. it would be better if the parametric values of each vertex( for the surface before triangulized ) are avaliable along with the euclidean points so that we could use them for texture mapping. thanks, kwansik

	anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasn't dealt with 	cgm, asn.1, cda, dca, sgml, or any one of a number of other 	very successful file format. people seem perfectly capable 	dealing with these others. dealing with the format of tiff 	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct, lzw, and 	fax encoding of the image data. the majority of the libraries 	which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather 	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters. 	perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather 	simpleminded formats such as gif, pcx, and bmp, but to suggest 	that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous. 	that doesn't mean that gif isn't fine, but don't even thing about 	using it in many instances. gif is very nice for use in low-end 	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would 	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems. fax is nice, 	but it doesn't do color (and gif doesn't do b&w all that well). 	jpeg is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end. 	the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle 	all these situations (and then some). naturally it's more complex. 	but i'ld rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging 	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday. 	you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes 	but please don't wrail against it's complexity. the complexity 	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and 	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially 	viable file formats. 	if we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all 	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length 	encoding.

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry. computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing. this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (ibm visualization data explorer software) and students will have access to cornell theory center computing resources, including video recording equipment. audience: researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art computer graphics into their research; computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization. the class size will be limited to 25 participants on a first-come first-served basis. level: graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 credits. may be taken without credit as a workshop. calculus, linear algebra and introductory chemistry required. familiarity with unix, x-windows and c is useful but not required. date: june 14-25, 1993 (2 credits) june 14-18, 1993 (1 or 0 credits) time: mon-fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm cost: 0 or 1 credit $410 2 credits $820 format the course will be held in the theory center training facility where computer workstations will be available. daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment. students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project. those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems encountered. content (may vary) elements of computer graphics polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow programming (dx), interactivity. representing the atom size, time and energy scales basic classical and quantum mechanics important categories of molecules small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts, miscellaneous current applications data formats and conversions advanced molecular graphics techniques types of simulation and experiment electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics electrostatics, x-ray crystallography, nmr, quantum dynamics and spectroscopy. instructors the course will be taught by two instructors. topics related to computer graphics will be handled by dr. bruce land, project leader of visualization, cornell national supercomputing facility. chemistry-specific aspects of the course will be handled by dr. richard e. gillilan, visualization specialist and research scientist, cornell national supercomputing facility to register: mail completed form to cornell university school of continuing education and summer sessions b20 day hall ithaca, ny 14853-2801 questions: richard gillilan (607) 254-8757 richard@tc.cornell.edu important: acceptance will be first-come, first-served and based on a target class size of 15 full-credit and 10 single or non-credit participants. deadline: may 20, 1993 ----------------------- application form ---------------------- scientific visualization of chemical systems chemistry 782 computer science 718 u.s. social security number (if available) _____ -

image processing and display ========================================================== pc and mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ====================== imdisp ------ imdisp written at jpl and other nasa sites. can do simple display, enhancing, smoothing and so on. works with the fits and vicar/pds data formats of nasa. can read tiff images, if you know their dimensions [pc and macs] labview 2 --------- labview is used as a framework for image processing tools. it provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements. hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram (program). functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc. the tool allows any virtual instrument (vi, a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument. national instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (dsp) boards for macintoshs and pc compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer. new software tools for dsp are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. the tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software. there are three levels of dsp programming associated with the nb-dsp2300 board and labview: use of the nb-dsp2300 analysis library: ffts, power spectra, filters routines callable from think c and macintosh programers workshop (mpw) c that execute on the nb-dsp2300 board. there is an analysis virtual interface library of ready-to-use vis optimized for the nb-dsp2300. use of the national instruments developers toolkit that includes an optimizing c compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the dsp hardware. this approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use. use of the national instruments interface kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the nb-dsp2300 board. (this is the easiest route for the development of custom code.) ultimage concept vi ------------------- concept vi by graftek-france is a family of image processing virtual instruments (vis) that give labview 2 (described above) users high-end tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems. a vi is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument. typical applications for concept vi include thermography, surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging, electronic microscopy and remote sensing. ultimage concept vi addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis. it includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and characterization. the program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane. standard input and output formats include pict, tiff, satie, and aipd. other formats can be imported. image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic operations, and geometric transformations, among others. morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others. quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and morphological distribution. measures include area, perimeter, center of gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and shape factors and equivalence. measures are saved in ascii format. the program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules. a 3-d view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. the histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. there are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity. these include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines. the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude) data. the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts. the transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even hole filling. the program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area, perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points. gtfs, inc. 2455 bennett valley road #100c santa rosa, ca 95494 707-579-1733 iplab spectrum -------------- iplab spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by graftek-franceus ultimage concept vi. using scripting tools, the user tells the system the operations to be performed. the problem is that far too many basic operations require manual intervention. the tool supports: ffts, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a movie command for cycling through windows. macintosh-based tools ===================== ncsa image, ncsa paledit and more --------------------------------- ncsa provides a whole suite of public-domain

has been imported it can be rre-toucheds with various editing tools typical of those used in macintosh-based rpaints applications. these include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush. advanced rpastes tools that control the interaction between a pasted selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated. for example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from being pasted. photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%, allowing you to create ghost overlays. rphoto-editings tools include control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation modification and spectrum equalization. images can be subjected to various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image, blur edges, or locate edges. image scaling is also supported. for storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as jpeg, availlable from storm technologies. the latest version of adobe photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: epsf, epsf, tiff, pict resource, amiga iff/ilbm, compuserve gif, macpaint, pixar, pixelpaint, scitex ct, tga and

and paint package from letraset that has more features than adobe photoshop but is decidedly more complex and therefore more difficult to use. several steps are often required to accomplish that which can be done in a single step using photoshop. the application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can easily end up with images in the 30 mb range. the program provides a variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool" which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close hues, color range and mask. imagestudio: don't know... letraset usa 40

of digital darkroom has five new selection and editing tools for enhancing images. one such feature allows the user to select part of an image simply by "painting" it. a new polyline selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide selections. a brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion of the image. note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool. this tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale images only. it should be noted that digital darkroom is not as powerful as either adobe photoshop or colorstudio. silicon beach software

imported). microfrontier 7650 hickman road des moines, ia 50322 515-270-8109 image analyst ------------- an image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images. image analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language. it is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs. image analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically. image analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or a disk-stored image. within minutes, without the need for programming, the image analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image. measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images. image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and position. the tool provides direct support for the data translation and scion frame grabbers. a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr video camera or other ntsc or pal devices. there are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related sequence file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user defines. automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi) represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image. inside a roi, the program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape, the thickness of a wall, etc. image analyst finds the center, edge and other positions automatically. the application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. it also supports histograms and a color look-up table (clut) tool. automatix, inc. 775 middlesex turnpike billerica,

under x windows. very flexible/extendable -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer. alv --- a sun-specific image toolkit. version 2.0.6 posted to comp.sources.sun on 11dec89. also available via email to alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk. aips ---- astronomical image processing system. contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu (also see the usenet newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits) built by nrao (national radio astronomy observatory, hq in charlottesville, va, sites in nm, az, wv). software distributed by 9-track, exabyte, dat, or (non-anonymous) internet ftp. documentation (postscript mostly) available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103), directory pub/aips and pub/aips/text/publ. installation requires building the system and thus a fortran and c compiler. this package can read and write fits data (see sci.astro.fits), and is primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of radio astronomy data from radio telescopes, particularly the very large array (vla), a synthesis instrument. it consists of almost 300 programs that do everything from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy. there is an x11-based image tool (xas) and a tek-compatible xterm-based graphics tool built into aips. the xas tool is modelled after the hardware functionality of the international imaging systems model 70 display unit and can do image arithmetic, etc. the code is mostly fortran 77 with some system c language modules, and is available for suns, ibm rs/6000, dec/ultrix, convex, cray (unicos), and alliant with support planned for hp-9000/7xx, solaris 2.1, and maybe sgi. there is currently a project - "aips++" - underway to rewrite the algorithmic functionality of aips in a modern setting, using c++ and an object oriented approach. whereas aips is proprietary code (licensed for free to non-profit institutions) owner by nrao and the nsf, aips++ will be in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with contributions from the us, canada, england, the netherlands, india, and australia to name a few. laboimage

image processing) is a powerful system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in interactive times. feature description disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options. all functions can be easily accessed via the disimp executive. this menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function. such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules. processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and ratioing. host configuration requirements running on unix workstations, disimp is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times. disimp is available in both runtime and programmer's environments. using the programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific applications programs. graphics are governed by an icon-based display panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image. manipulations of look up tables, colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control. a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of image, graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing. overlays of grids, text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery. the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help required. disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras. the purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of remote sensed data. for further information, please contact: the business manager, clough engineering group systems division, 627 chapel street, south yarra, australia 3141. telephone:

years, sold to weather service and navy. runs on hp9000 with hp-ux. supports 24-bit display" hips ---- (human information processing laboratory's image processing system) michael landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil exploration, etc.). it is called hips, and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images. it has been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library. feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research, system development and teaching. it handles sequences of images (movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames. programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations, filtering, convolution, fourier and other transform processing, edge detection and line drawing manipulation, digital image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image statistics computation. over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed. as a result, almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally, hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines. new users become effective using hips on their first day. hips features images that are self-documenting. each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image. hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header, and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix ``filters''. it comes complete with source code, on-line manual pages, and on-line documentation. host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university, hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available. it runs under the unix operating system. it is modular and flexible, provides automatic documentation of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment. hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax, sun, apollo, masscomp, ncr tower, iris, ibm at, etc. for image display and input, drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage (ikonas) image processors, and the sun-2, sun-3, sun- 4, and sun-386i consoles. we also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx, sun console, matrox vip-1024, iti ip-512, lexidata, macintosh ii, x windowing system, and iris). the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs-4000. it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max- video. hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98% of hips is machine independent. availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system, both as an interactive research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. it is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel- to-reel or sun cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

thalmanns animation system from montreal. these are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ] mira stands for microcomputer image reduction and analysis. mira gives workstation level performance on 386/486 dos computers using svga cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768. mira contains a very handsome/functional gui which is mouse and keystroke operated. mira reads/writes tiff and fits formats, native formats of a number of ccd cameras, and uncompressed binary images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions. the result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. mira does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format. over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the intel hardware. the entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations. windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse. there are also smooth, real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. a wide selection of grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other palettes can be generated. supported functions include such niceties as the following: o image & image: + - / * interpolation o image & constant: + - / * o unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log, byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o convolutions/filters: laplacian, sobel edge operator, directional gradient, line, gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel. ellipse, rectangle, line, gradient, gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to any specified angle. o ccd data

[ more info is needed -- nfotis ] ======================================================================== 15. where can i find the geometric data for the: ================================================ a. teapot ? ----------- "displays on display" column of ieee cg&a jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the martin newell's teapot. the article also has the bezier patch model and a pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot. ieee cg&a sep '87 in jim blinn's column "jim blinn's corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; bezier curves with rotations for example are used. the off and spd packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself. the off data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). the spd package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution. b. space shuttle ? ------------------ tolis lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of space shuttle datafiles. here's a summary (from his sci.space list): model1: a modified version of the newsgroup model (model2) 406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). payload doors non-existent. units: unknown. simon marshall (s.marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. he said there is no proprietary information associated with it. model2: the newsgroup model, in off format. you can find it in gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu , /pub/graphics/comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data model3: the triangles' model. this model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model. greg henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy. he did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution. model4: the nasa model. the file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by lockheed in their simulations: <x offset> <y offset> <z offset> from then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions 3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex, 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex, 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). payload doors closed. units: inches. jon berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model proprietary info: unknown model5: the old shuttle model. the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions. 104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). payload doors open. units: meters. we have been using this model at star labs, stanford university, for some years now. contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor scott williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy. ======================================================================== 16. image annotation software ============================= a. touchup runs in sunview and is pretty good. it reads in rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a rasterfile. b. idraw (part of stanford's interviews distribution) can handle some image formats in addition to being a macdraw like tool. i'm not sure exactly what they are. you can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu. c. tgif is another macdraw like tool that can handle x11 bitmap (xbm) and x11 pixmap (xpm) formats. if the image you have is in formats other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert things like gif or even some macintosh formats to xpm. tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu (version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9) d. use the editimage facility of khoros (see below). this is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package. e. you might be able to get by with pbmplus. pbmtext gives you text output bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image. f. 'ice' requires sun hardware running openwindows 3.it's a postscript-based graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from internet host eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). requires sun c++ 2.0 and two other locally developed packages, the lxt library (an xlib-based toolkit) and a small c++ class library. all files (pub/ice.tar.z, pub/lxt.tar.z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.z) are available in compressed tar format. pub/ice.tar.z contains a readme that gives installation instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1). a statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.z for sparc systems is also available for ftp. all software is the property of columbia university and may not be redistributed without permission. ice means image composition environment and it's an imaging tool that allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of postscript annotations in wysiwyg fashion via x11 imaging routines and news postscript rasterizing. g. use imagemagick to annotate an image from your x server. pick the position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen color from a pull-down menu. imagemagick can read and write many of the more popular image formats. imagemagick is available as export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/imagemagick.tar.z or at your nearest x11 archive. ======================================================================== 17. scientific visualization stuff ================================== x data slice (xds) ------------------- bundled with the x11 distribution from mit, in the contrib directory. available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50] (either as a source or binaries for various platforms). national center for supercomputing applications (ncsa) tool suite ----------------------------------------------------------------- platforms: unix workstations (dec, ibm, sgi, sun) apple macintosh cray supercomputers availability: now available. source code in the public domain. ftp from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. contact: national center for supercomputing applications computing applications building 605 e. springfield ave. champaign, il 61820 cost: free (zero dollars). the suite includes tools for 2d image and 3d scene analysis and visualization. the code is actively maintained and updated. spyglass -------- they sell commercial versions of the ncsa tools. examples are: 	spyglass dicer (3d volumetric data analysis package) 		platform: mac 	spyglass transform (2d data analysis package) 		platforms: mac, sgi, sun, dec, hp, ibm contact: spyglass, inc. p.o. box 6388 champaign, il 61826 (217) 355-6000 khoros 1.0 patch 5 ------------------ available via anonymous ftp at pprg.eece.unm.edu (129.24.24.10). cd to /pub/khoros to see what is available. it is huge (> 100 mb), but good. needs unix and x11r4. freely copied (not pd), complete with sources and docs. very extensive and at its heart is visual programming. khoros components include a visual programming language, code generators for extending the visual language and adding new application packages to the system, an interactive user interface editor, an interactive image display package, an extensive library of image and signal processing routines, and 2d/3d plotting packages. see comp.soft-sys.khoros on usenet and the relative faq for more info.... contact: the khoros group room 110 eece dept. university of new mexico albuquerque, nm 87131 email: khoros-request@chama.eece.unm.edu macphase -------- analysis & visualization application for the macintosh. operates on 1d and 2d data arrays. import/export several different file formats. several different plotting options such as gray scale, color raster, 3d wire frame, 3d surface, contour, vector, line, and combinations. ffts, filtering, and other math functions, color look up editor, array calculator, etc. shareware, available via anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu in the info-mac/app directory. for other information contact doug norton (e-mail: 74017.461@@compuserve.com) iris explorer ------------- it's an application creation system developed by silicon graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. the explorer gui allows users to build custom applications without having to write any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. also, existing code can be easily integrated into the explorer environment. explorer currently is available now on sgi and cray machines, but will become available on other platforms in time.

this is the only package i use or know much about. other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer. you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g. "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and god only knows what all else -- there's a lot. i don't have and don't use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for. each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from a common "parameter file" which must be (in vms anyway) in your "default directory." some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations. the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic, but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated, lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.) there's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the pci data structures (database file, parameter file). the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well. for instance, the tape i/o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band (what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different "interleave" orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry's "ct2t" format, would probably (i haven't tried) handle targa, and so on. above all, however, you have to know what you're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over. it's worth noting that the pci "database" file is designed to contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of other information (i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude, longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this can go into the pci "database"). i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used. on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems (the name gould/deanza seems to come to mind). one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci "database" file to a peritek vct-q (q-bus 24-bit directcolor) display subsystem. pci software could be "overkill" in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end" applications/users, i.e. those for whom a mac/pc largely doesn't suffice (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). it's probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada, a country which does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing; i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas. spam (spectral analysis manager) -------------------------------- back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer) which uses much larger images. spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, pc and ihs transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays). actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement (stretching). spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering. the original spam uses x or sunview to display. the aviris version may require vicar, an executive based on tae, and may also require a frame buffer. i can refer you to people if you're interested. pcw requires x for display. map ii ------ among the mac gis systems, map ii is distributed by john wiley. clrview ------- clrview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real-time capabilities of silicon graphics iris computers. this program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from cad and gis sources. it supports the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as dxf, tin, dem, lattices, and arc/info coverages among others. clrview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) in the directory pub/sgi/clrview. contact: rodney hoinkes head of design applications centre for landscape research university of toronto tel: (416) 978-7197 email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca ========================================================================== end of resource listing -- nick (nikolaos) fotis national technical univ. of athens, greece home: 16 esperidon st., internet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr halandri, gr - 152 32 uucp: mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis athens, greece fax: (+30 1) 77 84 578

i'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z-buffering, that i've encountered in 2 different pex implementations. i can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex faq, gaskins's _pexlib_programming_manual_, vendors' documentation). i'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex. the problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish. if you can run pexlib 5.x programs and are interested, i encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it. (it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given.) the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas. the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area. because of this, it's a tossup whether the z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid. using the pexlib api, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines. the pex structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines. the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines. this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller vrc z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas. this means that when a point is transformed to npc, its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias. i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit z-buffers). therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching. but in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range. (empirically, it's worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.) it's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the z-buffer have any dependable meaning! this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind. i've observed the problem on both hewlett-packard and digital workstation pex servers, to approximately the same degree. the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an hp-ux system with pex 5.1. open questions: (1) why does this happen? -- am i configuring the pex view table wrongly? -- is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which could be corrected for? -- are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators? -- something else? (2) what to do about it? -- can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z-buffered hlhsr? -- is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts? -- am i just out of luck? any help would be immensely appreciated! -- =============================================================================== dave gorgen internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com applicon inc. gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com ann arbor, michigan (usa) uucp: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen

greetings this is a general call for information regarding image processing. i am looking for any material related to the field, and am also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the field. in particular source code for general use packages. i already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. i'm not mathematically literate (ie. i don't have a degree in mathematics), so any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not mathematically intensive. the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is: "practical digital image processing" by rhys lewis isbn: 0-13-683525-2 published by ellis horwood (c)1990. likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate image processing techniques. so far i have 'xv', and 'khoros' for unix.

(2) type of scaling (qt is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder). (3) playback window position (movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, i'm not sure about premiere). any combination of those can radically alter playback performance. image size is, of course, another biggie. giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference. forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread... -peter lee -- /-------------------- peter e. lee, software conductor ----------------------\ | specular international, inc. | | lee@cs.umass.edu or (413) 256-1329 (h) or (413) 549-7600 (w) | \-------- beauty is 24 bits deep, plus eight bits of alpha channel ----------/

---------------------- lightwave3d mail-list ---------------------- -- what is lightwave? -- lightwave3d is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the "toaster" (from newtek, inc.) that operates on an amiga platform. the lightwave software (lightwave=lightwave3d and lightwave modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes. -- why are we doing this? -- this mailing list is for those interested in the lightwave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them. the list is for those who own the toaster and lightwave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package. we hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group. -- what are the rules? -- since lightwave/modeler are just a part of the newtek video toaster software, i'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the toaster. however, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3d software, related tools and products. you do not have to own a toaster to join this list! -- ok! how do i join? -- to become a member of the lightwave3d mailing list you must send a mail message to the address: lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com in the body of the message enter: subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain or just ask to be signed up and i will sign you up to the list. at this point in time the process is manual but i hope to get an automated script based system in place soon. there shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining. expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you send your request. then, expect the mail to start flowing in! -- how do i post to the list? -- contributing to the list is simple. just mail your articles to the following address: lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list. your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list. however, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you. so, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you. this doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list. in fact, just the opposite is true. it means that your article was posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address. note: i hope to have a fix for this behavior soon. -- how do i quit the list? -- simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up: lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com in the body of the message enter: unsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain i will remove your name from the list of members. please, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list! if you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and i will suspend forwarding of the articles to you. -- what about old articles? -- i am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox). however, i can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space. what we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list. they can compress and store them in archives on their system. they can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates. if there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large scsi hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin> i have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the lightwave3d mailing list. for information on this service, please send a mail message to: fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com the first command to the server must be "help" or "user name <passwd>". use help to request a current copy of the helpfile. use user name [passwd] to connect to the service. use ? to get a short listing of all available commands. -- now what do i do? -- well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information. if you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list. every little bit helps. questions are welcomed! it makes some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin> if you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact me at the address: lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com cheers, bob lindabury

my wife wants to publish a newsletter. she's no artist, so she intends to use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box around it etc. we have mspublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. right now she's looking at corel draw and harvard draw. there seem to be more books in the stores on corel than on harvard, so she's inclined to go with corel on the basis of popularity. can anyone give us an informed opinion on which package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative available? if this is a faq, please withhold the flames and just send the location of the faq document. thanks. three ps's: 1) is it ok to use clip art from harvard draw or whatever for commercial purposes? 2) we have a 600 dpi laser jet 4 printer. what would be a good scanner for reading in paper clipart? 3) how about someone starting up a newsgroup on desktop publishing if one doesn't exist?

i'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3d key frame positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement. i'm using kochanek-bartels splines (as described in the siggraph '84 proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames. i want the inbetweens to be given in the form (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at (x,y,z). the method presented by kochanek and bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated. i've tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although the spatial movement seems to work fine; and i'm quite certain - i think :) - that i've not simply made an implementation error...) now i wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors. i'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at iharkest@lise.unit.no anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of the replies if they contact me. -- _________ __________________ \\ \\ \\ \\ n g e \\==\\ a r k e s t a d iharkest@lise.unit.no comp. sc. \\________\\ \\_______________ nth (norwegian institute of technology) "some people play hard to get, i play hard to want" (ford fairlane)

i'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. what i want to do is the following; from a fast source, eg. a cdrom, several sound sources are read, each having it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc. given the listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction. this means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source. (i think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle. this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source. this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.) additionally some reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm. have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? please post or mail any answers or comments. -- torgeir veimo studying at the university of bergen "...i'm gona wave my freak flag high!"

recently we have found tiff manipulation packages which do not recognize tiff files output by xv. this is due to a missing xresolution and yresolution tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for valid tiff. i have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these do indeed copy these tags. has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags? i have been told that i could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv. i hope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer to find code already known to work in xv. -- :s :s larry w. virden inet: lvirden@cas.org :s personal: 674 falls place, reynoldsburg, oh 43068-1614

i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3-d interactive applications what types of 3-d widgets you would like to have in your applications. a 3-d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-d objects of the application. it may let you - manipulate application data, the camera, 3-d objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-d objects via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever i missed but you think is possible. for example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects. the length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance. a widget can provide both manipulation and feedback. for example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis. please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-d interaction. the information i gathered will help me design a 3-d ui construction tool. your help is very much appreciated. tony lau <tlau@cs.ubc.ca> m.sc. student dept. of computer science

first annual phigs user group conference the first annual phigs user group conference was held march 21-24 in orlando, florida. the conference was organized by the rensse- laer design research center in co-operation with ieee and sig- graph. attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents. a good cross-section of the phigs community was represented at this conference with participants including phigs users, workstation vendors, third-party phigs implementors, stan- dards committee members, and researchers from industry and academia. the opening speaker, dr. richard puk, challenged phigs users to "take charge of your phigs" by participating in phigs standardization activities and communicating their needs to phigs implementors. the closing speaker, dr. andries van dam, described his vision of the future of graphics standards "beyond phigs". technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics: phigs and x, application toolkits, application issues, texture mapping, nurbs, phigs extensions, and object-oriented libraries and frameworks. panel sessions on phigs and pex, phigs non-retained data, real-world cad applications using phigs, and portability issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences. the conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3d graphics to object-oriented tools based on phigs. next year's conference is planned for march, 1994. phigs everywhere at the conference, phigs vendors described and demonstrated phigs products that run on all types of computers, from pcs to mainframes. megatek corporation demonstrated their phigs extensions including conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing and translucency. template graphics software launched figaro+ pro, the photo- realistic option for phigs+. figaro+ pro is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing phigs+ api, with features like ray tracing, materials, anti-aliasing and texture mapping. radiosity support is also planned. figaro+ is an example of how tgs continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products. figaro+ supports immediate mode extensions to phigs and also supports sun xgl, hp starbase and sgi gl/opengl. figaro+ for nt will be released this summer. tgs also demonstrated the latest versions of figraph, a powerful "2-call" charting system based on phigs+, and figt, an object- oriented utility library for phigs/pex developers. g5g and gallium software demonstrated a new version of gphigs on silicon graphics workstations. scheduled for summer, 1993, ver- sion 3.0 of gphigs, the company's phigs+ library for worksta- tions, will include an advanced phigs debugger that allows phigs developers to display and browse phigs structures and other phigs internal state. g5g also described their non-duplicated data store that stores pointers to application data in the gphigs css for more efficient use of memory. in addition, g5g described their application gse that allows application callback functions during gphigs traversal. gphigs and phigure, g5g's data visual- izer and application development toolkit, are currently available on all major workstations that support gl, x windows, pex, or starbase. wise software presented a slide show of z-phigs for ms-windows and arena, a phigs based modeller/render. z-phigs implements most of the phigs+ primitives. in addition z-phigs has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera- tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. a demo disk of z-phigs or arena is available on request. atc exhibited grafpak-phigs, their full-featured phigs implemen- tation based on dec phigs. grafpak-phigs is available on most workstation platforms with c, fortran and ada bindings and incor- porates pex support. within the booth sponsored by advanced technology center, digital equipment corporation demonstrated dec phigs v2.4 running on the dec 3000/400 axp pxg. atcs' grafpak-phigs is a port of dec phigs. dec phigs v2.4 contains most phigs and phigs plus features with support for pex v5.1 protocol. dec phigs also contains most gm/eds phigs extensions including post-to-view as well as proprietary extensions to support immediate mode rendering and the use of phigs in an x11 environment. axp, dec, and dec phigs are trademarks of digital equipment cor- poration. grafpak-phigs and atc are trademarks of advanced tech- nology center. pex and x11 are trademarks of massachusetts insti- tute of technology. the ibm exhibit featured a gto accelerator attached to an ibm 340 workstation running graphigs and pex. hewlett packard and shographics demonstrated at the conference. a hewlett packard machine was coupled to display on a shographics pex terminal. hp showcased their latest phigs product enhance- ments. phigs user group the phigs users group was formed to aid the development of phigs applications and provide user feedback to phigs implementors and phigs standards bodies. for more information about the phigs users group, send e-mail to: phigsug@cadrt10.me.vt.edu or write to: sankar

we need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place in tel-aviv university. we have two databases that we are currently working on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated and ones that will give prettier images. before i describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are going to present a paper titled "photo-realistic imaging of digital terrains" which describes the research and the results, in the eurographics'93 conference in barcelona, this september. we are going to show a video-tape with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator. we are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, and terrain elevation maps (dtm). each database consists of a 2d array of height values (any data format can be used for each value), and a corresponding 2d array of color values (can be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit r/g/b values. other format can also be used). we work on 512x512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases. if anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us directly : amit@math.tau.ac.il (amit shaked), or danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (daniel cohen) of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be cited in our paper, and in further publications.

more people have been asking for information on the kubota graphics workstations, so here is some more info on the kenai/denali vs. the e&s freedom. here is the text of a denali vs. e&s freedom done by d.h. brown associates. ------ denali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design. both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations. both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors. as a result, denali and freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality. both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration. there remain, however, several important differences between the kpc and e&s products. evans and sutherland designed freedom as a high-end developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility. in its favor, freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than denali. all freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions. the freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications. finally, e&s provided freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications. note that kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not require an external video encoder. e&s programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible. the kpc design team, in contrast, made denali more of an end-user's system. entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points. denali does not need as many 29050 modules as freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics. although both products provide strong support for 3d, imaging, and volume rendering, kpc recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities. denali's configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed. both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack sgi's more expensive vgxt and realityengine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability. kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method. on balance, however, denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than e&s for most applications. aside from being much more affordable, kpc solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage. by implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, e&s foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance. kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its frame buffer modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable solution. hope this helps, brian ps this was reprinted without permission. for the full text, please contact kubota 408-727-8100.

i use arts & letters on a pc and if you make use of the tracing preferences it traces beautifully. but - there's a trick to tracing. i've traced entire cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases a lot of work). you need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it together... it's kinda hard to explain in type, but if you're ever in reno i can give you a little demonstration!

(1988) 'colour defective vision and computer graphics displays', ieee computer graphics and applications 8(5) 28-40. you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram. >i would like to write a program (probably a ppm filter) to allow >previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour >blind users. not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult! yes this is certainly possible. you will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. this information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago. the procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (some lookup tables might be a help here.) a) convert rgb to cie xyz. this is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. b) retaining the y component for later, convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates u'v' using u' = 4x/(x+15y+3z), v' = 9y/(x+15y+3z) c) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above d) find the intersection as in step 3 e) convert back from u'v' to xyz, using the y value from step a f) ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in xyz space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable. >please email replies - i will summarise and repost if there is >sufficient interest done; also posted for the rest of us. -- chris lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road, manchester, uk. m13 9pl internet: c.c.lilley@mcc.ac.uk voice: +44 (0)61 275 6045 fax: +44 (0)61 275 6040 janet: c.c.lilley@uk.ac.mcc ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi there, i'm using pov-ray on my ibm compatible at home, but i would like to run some things at work on our vax computer. i believe there is a version of the source code for pov-ray that is vax specific, but i'm not sure where to find it (i've looked at the several sites where the ibmpc version of it can be found). can anyone help me? thanks in advance, ross kummer rmit,melbourne, australia internet address, rkummer@phillip.edu.au (no clever signoff yet, too busy playing with pov-ray)
anybody know where i can get graphics work shop? brad@utkvx.utk.edu

you can use pbm's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file, and feed this to cjpeg for compression. slow, and circuitous, but it will work. rick

vamilliron: yes, intel's pci is (another) local bus standard, which can be used for graphics, although i believe local buses can be used for other things, too. as far as i know, though, pci local bus would compete with vesa local bus, not the vesa graphics standard, but others more enlightened might be able to shed more light on this matter.
i need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of the file to be displayed, then just display that image and then quit. all of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some other silliness. this program is going to be run from within another program. i have lots of memory and vga color. any graphics format will do. has anyone heard of such a beast? 					keith -- keith knudsen notre dame, in

please help. i have an ibm-compatible notebook computer with an lcd vga screen. while i was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little, which i thought was odd since i do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals. it only did this for a second and then stopped. i left the room for several minutes and, when i returned, the screen was completely dim, not blank, but very very dim. the contrast slider still worked so that i could adjust it to where i could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect. i was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but i still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail. has anyone else experienced anything like this? if this just means that i need to replace the screen then i guess i'll have to but i thought that the "death" of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened. i didn't want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the net about this because i already know what they'll say: "yep, you gotta have this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???." i've only had the computer for about 21 months. is that a reasonable life cycle for a lcd display? oh, i guess i ought to give specifics here: the brand is compudyne (is this a reputable company?), it's a 386sx @ 20 mhz. i forget the model number exactly and i was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today. if anyone can help me, please give me any advice you might have. i'm not opposed to having it replaced, but i'd rather not if it's not absolutely necessary. if you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu but if you'd rather post i'll be checking back here in a couple of days. btw, if the answer to this question is already in a faq somewhere, feel free to flame away but i would ask that you also include the location and name of the faq if you don't mind. thanks in advance for any help... -mike mattone (mike@mik.uky.edu)

: i've only had the computer for about 21 months. is that a reasonable life : cycle for a lcd display? my toshiba t1100+ lcd (cga, 1986) died in 11 months. replaced under the 12 month warranty, fortunately. when it died, it died instantly and completely.

i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program, an interactive, full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl. besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc, bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs, such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image. the following is the relevant sections from the man page. ----------------------------------------------------------------- pre-release of may, 1993 bit(1l) name bit - bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl. as a full color program, bit handles images of both 24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner. as an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the many built-in styles of display. you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (the slideshow). with the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size. as an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently. it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of input images. you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another. in addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. postscript). bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately. convolution using exter- nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image. features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, the processed image will be displayed. current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color. o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with the option of subpixel sampling. o renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately, such as into a postscript file, to take advantage of a higher printer resolution. besides normal text strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta. o presents graphically the histogram of an image. o performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation. the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms. further, the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it. many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histograms of the image. o places simple geometric figures (sgfs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian- gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g, postscript file). all sgfs can be scaled in x- and y-directions independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a circle). o performs edge detection. in combination with image histograms and 1- to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained. o performs histogram equalization. o performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of arbitrary order. o crops a rectangular portion of an image. o cuts and pastes across images. o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount. o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images. (slideshow) o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs. distance plot. o performs image type conversions. o converts image formats. o smoothes an image (special convolution). o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it. o modify an individual pixel's rgb values. o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra. o spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release). supported formats o iris rgb, native to sgi iris o jpeg(jfif) format o compuserv gif o pnm(portable any map), including ppm, pgm and pbm. o xbm (x window bitmap) o tiff o postscript(write only) hardware requirements: --------------------------------------------------------------- any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode(), including indigoes. where to get it: --------------------------------------------------------------- anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.z where xxx is the version number. current version is 0.73 read src/01readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement: --------------------------------------------------------------- jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups's library version 4. forms library, developed by mark overmars, is used for gui. both jpeg and forms library are included in this release. --------------------------------------------------------------- bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images; the built-in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs. in addition, the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have. so try it (and you will like it). as always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.

i heard a friend who just return from nab from las vegas confirm that realsoft will be releasing a windows version of real-3d 2.0 this summer. he was told that the rendering speed on the dx50 isn't as fast as a4000. however, he was also told that they are switching from microsoft c++ to watcom to gain more speed. for people who is looking for a powerful 3d animation software for pc. the wait shouldn't be too long. real 3d 2.0 is absolutely the most powerful and flexible 3d package out there that sells for less than $1000. p.s. i heard a indigo version is also under development.
does anyone know if the source is available to create fli or flc animations? i would ideally like dll's for windows but would settle for c source. i've heard they might be available on amiga forums somewhere. the libraries currently distributed by autodesk, aawin, aaplay, do not have fli creation capability, only playback. any pointers would be appreciated, thanks! - andrew hudson abh@genesis.nred.ma.us

a great many computer programmers read "dr. dobb's journal". in a recent issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read. it said: "there's nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry. the industry needs an ibm for the 90's." where has the hacker ethic gone? not the "cracker" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative? why is it that people and corporations like bill gates, ibm, and intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry? why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored) why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products? i ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this? and further, how can you let it go on? it is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come. it has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before. i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, windows, and the ibm product line on the computer-using public. that is not to say i am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me. in fact, i applaud it; that is the american way. but those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem. and, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time. i put it to you thus: where has the hacker ethic gone? if it still exists, where? and, if it does exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers" allowing this to perpetuate itself? why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry? i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence. +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu | "revenge is a dish best served cold." | | "szechuan death" | - khan singh | | | "star trek ii: the wrath of khan"| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

i recently got a document describing the jpeg fif (jfif) file format. i was looking thru it, but i didn't get the idea how to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the whole image. how do you get the height and width of a jpeg in a jfif? how do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale picture? i wrote a small tool (lsgif) for gif that returns the filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing the header chunks. the output looks like this: 157605 bla.gif 640x 480 248c24 i use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since jpeg are getting more and more popular i would like to have a similar tool for jfif, with an output like this: 57605 bla.jpg 640x 480 c24 please respond by email, because i don't read this news group very often. i'll post a summary if it is useful. thanx in advance, 								larry +-------------------------------------+------------------------------+ | lars "larry" michael (mr. gif) | "if murphy's law | | lars@itu.sun.ac.za | can go wrong, it will." | | lsmichae@informatik.uni-erlangen.de +--------------+---------------+ | spec. stud. at univ. of stellenbosch south afrika | ham: zr/db3bw | | grad. stud. at univ. of erlangen/nuremberg germany | irc: pit | +----------------------------------------------------+---------------+

perhaphs what bill gates and steve jobs are now is the result of the natural evolution of a "successful" hacker. either you make money, go to jail (lee feldenstein [sp?]), or just fade away as "oh, that's uncle so-and-so who *really* likes computers...". what a "computer hacker" is and does will change as long as the definition of the word "computer" continues to change. -- james d. murray add@sciences.sdsu.edu

q1: where can i get gopher software? q2: what do i need to access gopher? q3: where are there publicly available logins for gopher? q4: who develops gopher software? q5: what is the relationship between gopher and (wais, www, ftp)? q6: are papers or articles describing gopher available? q7: what is veronica? q8: what is available for biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- q0: what is gopher? a0: the internet gopher client/server provides a distributed information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide information system (cwis) can readily be constructed. while providing a delivery vehicle for local information, gopher facilitates access to other gopher and information servers throughout the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------- q1: where can i get gopher software? a1: via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu. look in the directory /pub/gopher -------------------------------------------------------------------- q2: what do i need to access gopher? a2: you will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local pc or workstation there are clients for the following systems. the directory following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory /pub/gopher. unix curses & emacs : /pub/gopher/unix/gopher1.12.tar.z xwindows (athena) : /pub/gopher/unix/xgopher1.2.tar.z xwindows (motif) : /pub/gopher/unix/moog xwindows (xview) : /pub/gopher/unix/xvgopher macintosh hypercard : /pub/gopher/macintosh-turbogopher/old-versions * macintosh application : /pub/gopher/macintosh-turbogopher * dos w/clarkson driver : /pub/gopher/pc_client/ nextstep : /pub/gopher/next/ vm/cms : /pub/gopher/rice_cms/ or /pub/gopher/viegopher/ vms : /pub/gopher/vms/ os/2 2.0	 : /pub/gopher/os2/ mvs/xa : /pub/gopher/mvs/ many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the following is an attempt at a comprehensive list. a microsoft windows winsock client "the gopher book" sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip a macintosh application, "macgopher". ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/macintosh * another macintosh application, "gopherapp". ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp * a port of the unix curses client for dos with pc/tcp oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe a port of the unix curses client for pc-nfs 	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe a beta version of the pc gopher client for novell's lan workplace for dos lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher a vms decwindows client for use with wollongong or ucx job.acs.ohio-state.edu:xgopher_client.share * note: these macintosh clients require mactcp. most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client itself. put the following on a gopher server: type=1 host=boombox.micro.umn.edu port=70 path= name=gopher software distribution. or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and look in the gopher directory. there are also a number of public telnet login sites available. the university of minnesota operates one on the machine "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) see q3 for more information about this. it is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites. a client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.) a local client is also faster. --------------------------------------------------------------------- q3: where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to in order to get a taste of gopher) for gopher?

a4: gopher was originally developed in april 1991 by the university of minnesota microcomputer, workstation, networks center to help our campus find answers to their computer questions. it has since grown into a full-fledged world wide information system used by a large number of sites in the world. many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to count. the people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail: internet gopher developers 100 union st. se #190 minneapolis, mn 55455 usa or via fax at: +1 (612) 625-6817 --------------------------------------------------------------------- q5: what is the relationship between gopher and (wais, www, ftp)? a5: gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems. as shipped the unix gopher server has the capability to: - search local wais indices. - query remote wais servers and funnel the results to gopher clients. - query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher clients. - be queried by www (world wide web) clients (either using built in gopher querying or using native http querying. ------------------------------------------------------------------- q6: are papers or articles describing gopher available?

[2] why use jpeg? there are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.) if your viewing software doesn't support jpeg directly, you'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even with a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance). thus, using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. it's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. i'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today. furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard. [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? jpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images, gif is superior in image quality, file size, or both. one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to. as a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. jpeg is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.) gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif. jpeg can't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form. (in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they should be avoided in jpeg files.) jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc. the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't jpeg it. computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it. the same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg. you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not. if you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do. (section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. if you start from a gif, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg can only make things worse.) however, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. if you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints. be prepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not convert well. [4] how well does jpeg compress images? pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b. file	 size in bytes		comments ship.ppm	1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.z	 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (see sec. 7.) ship.jpg95	 155622 cjpeg -q 95 (highest useful quality setting) 			 this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	 58009 cjpeg -q 75 (default setting) 			 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	 38406 cjpeg -q 50 			 this has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been jpeged without seeing 			 the original. still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	 25192 cjpeg -q 25 			 jpeg's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 still, i've seen plenty of usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! in this case jpeg can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif, better if you have a full-color display). this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] what are good "quality" settings for jpeg? most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. "quality 95" does not mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. the default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice. this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. except for experimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality. if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand, you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation. the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg. the default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info). if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art". (note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it. other jpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.) [6] where can i get jpeg software? most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp. if you don't know how to use ftp, see the faq article "how to find sources". (if you don't have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body. the "anonymous ftp list faq" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. note: this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive. [6a] if you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc: the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. if you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. x windows: xv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other image formats. it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations. it's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z. version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking. if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg. but 2.21 works fine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg. caution: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry. another good choice for x windows is john cristy's free imagemagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z. this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software. both of the above are large, complex packages. if you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. the next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. ms-dos: this covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings. one good choice is eric praetzel's free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files. the current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. the user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei's hiview. the current version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and os/2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. for larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). you may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30). this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview, at least on my hardware. (for images larger than screen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. requires a vesa graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver, so don't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing.) a second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but i don't know any stable archive location for it. the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time. the well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest revision, 8.60a. however, cshow's jpeg implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware, $25. available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you have hi-color hardware, don't use gif as the intermediate format; try to find a targa-capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) the independent jpeg group's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will convert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats. handmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif. these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg. the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format. since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability. version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. note: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is not readable on non-pc platforms. handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images. a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. note about simtel20: the internet's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>". if you are not physically on milnet, you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives; most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics". if you have no ftp capability, you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is. microsoft windows: there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images. (windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware, due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window.) the newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. but it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... jview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can't create new jpeg files, and it doesn't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. the current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) winjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (this is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) colorview is another shareware entry ($30). this was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.) dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. os/2: the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip image archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface. strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows (see description in windows section). shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip pmview 0.85: jpeg/gif/bmp viewer. gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing fast if you have huge amounts of ram, otherwise about the same speed as the above programs. strong 24-bit display support. shareware, $20. macintosh: most mac jpeg programs rely on apple's jpeg implementation, which is part of the quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed. to use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later. (if you're running system 6, you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.) you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways. with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.) mac users should keep in mind that quicktime's jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for details.) if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format. most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. the first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format. it also can convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. requires system 7 and quicktime. on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac. given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) some people like this behavior, some don't. overall, jpegview's user interface is very well thought out. gifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and pict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later. gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. also, the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it's faster with quicktime.) note: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version. jpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. this will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer. previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert. apple's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and gif format, and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime. some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse, pictpixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie, called pictcompressor, floating around the net. if you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.) storm technology's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter. this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can't use it.) you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it. if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance), gifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing. if you don't want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer. more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format. adobe photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu). you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it. amiga: (most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. it's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm, and gif images. the program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (note: although this directory is supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under amigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) viewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer. the current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha. if you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24 and viewtek. these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and imagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro), from asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas. imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support. the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats. the amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). among these are "augjpeg", "newamyjpeg", "vjpeg", and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion, anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. atari st: the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats. for monochrome st monitors, try mgif, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering. version 4.1 reads jpeg files. available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/mgif41b.zoo. i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewers for ataris, but surely there must be some by now? pointers appreciated. acorn archimedes: !changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg, although this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking. recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg, along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede, the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). there's also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. contact: dt software, freepost, cambridge, uk. tel: 0223 841099. portable software for almost any system: if none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you'll also need a viewer program. if your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image files. there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6b] if you are looking for source code to work with: free, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group, which i lead. a package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. the "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp. if you are on a pc and don't know how to cope with .tar.z format, you may prefer zip format, which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on compuserve, in the graphsupport forum (go pics), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. if you have no ftp access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (if you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the faq article "how to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.) the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg "jfif" format and image files in gif, pbmplus ppm/pgm, utah rle, and truevision targa file formats. the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. the package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays. we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg-related products. we do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details). we hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. this process is called "color quantization". (this is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term. we're stuck with the standard usage though.) clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings). since jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for *all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. this happens because jpeg's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see posted images described as "256-color jpeg". this tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif. jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for jpeg.) on the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) for purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. this is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. for this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. jpeg's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg images you already have. with a gif, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. it's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes, etc. for these people, gif is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively. thus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] how does jpeg work? the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. this article's long enough already, so i'm not going to say more than that here. for technical information, see the comp.compression faq. this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. if you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] what about lossless jpeg? there's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. however, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg algorithm, and it offers much less compression. at present, very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial. saying "-q 100" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image. what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. at this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a huffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] why all the argument about file formats? strictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of official standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems. they have defined two jpeg-based file formats: * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a "low-end" format that transports pixels and not much else. * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). tiff is a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff. it's not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff/jpeg is well defined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable. a particular case that people may be interested in is apple's quicktime software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand; see section 11 for details. another particular case is handmade software's programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format. by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by hsi. this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings. use the -j switch to get jfif output. (this applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.) [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won't read, it's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format. you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'jfif'. 2. if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a "raw jpeg" file. this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you're out of luck unless you have hsi software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they won't decompress properly with non-hsi programs. 4. a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it. 5. anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all. if you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream. if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8), try stripping off everything before that. in uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is 	"begin" line 	m_]c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with 	"begin" line 	m:'-i ... if you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files. [12] what about arithmetic coding? the jpeg spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. the choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.) unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi. thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (the "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) at least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. in particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet. there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. stay tuned for further details. [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? it would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. unfortunately this is not the case. in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical jpeg file. even this is not true; at least, not with the current free jpeg software. it's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it. in any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (if you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format (ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? as stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from, it's far better to make a jpeg from that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif. (so check the sizes too.) experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation. don't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also, don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image. while useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges). do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows system, xv's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher q setting may not be necessary.) color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store. if you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the trouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and jpeg can't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it). to get around this, you want to "smooth" the gif image before compression. smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. try "-smooth 10" or so when converting gifs. values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs. heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. if you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol... the upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. -- 			tom lane 			organizer, independent jpeg group internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	bitnet: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie

on a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead. as someone else said, take the gnu offerings for example - free, redistributable and often better than the commercial stuff. take also the number of papers published every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing this knowledge. have fun, roddi
i think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er) gates' and jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a phenomenom as it is now. with the increased popularity of the pc come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical minded and narrower-focused programmers. why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or programs for accountants? basically, the yuppies caught up and disciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image. -- carl christensen /~~\_/~\ ,,, dept. of computer science christen@astro.ocis.temple.edu | #=#==========# | temple university "curiouser and curiouser!" - lc \__/~\_/ ``` philadelphia, pa usa
does any one know of a decent quality library of routines for performing 3d graphics modelling on the pc? ideally the routines would be embeded in our application program. requirements (wish list): - flat surface modelling (simple phong shading optional) - ability to plot hidden-line drawings - texture mapping -- both procedural and bit map - modeling light sources (local, distant, and spot lights) - ray-tracing - radiosity (optional) any comments would be appreciated. john chinnick -- jchinnic@mach1.wlu.ca phone : (519) 888-9666 -- john chinnick -- jchinnic@mach1.wlu.ca

	intro to access.bus (re: the access.bus software creator's 	contest announcement) what is access.bus? access.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity. access.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to a single pc port. peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (mice, trackballs, joysticks), printers, vr gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host pc. applications such as cad/cam, data acquisition, simulation, virtual reality, multiple-player/single pc games, education and many, many more can now take advantage of access.bus, the technology that puts plug and play on every pc. the access.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals. multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port. common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development. as an open standard, access.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device. access.bus technological description: ===================================== access.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty. access.bus has a bus topology architecture. that is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices. access.bus data rate is 100 kbits/sec. access.bus physical layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ access.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on i2c hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line. standard low-cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization. access.bus software protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the access.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: i2c protocol, base protocol, and application protocol. i2c protocol: this simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. i2c provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates. bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver. base protocol: establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals. the host becomes the access.bus manager. the base protocol defines the format of an access.bus message envelope, which is an i2c bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum. unique features of the base protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging. auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches. hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting. application protocol: this is the highest level of the access.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices. each type requires a different application protocol. three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices. access.bus support on the pc ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ all three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the pc. an add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices. an access.bus manager - tsr under dos and a dll under windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the access.bus device drivers. drivers are available for multiple access.bus keyboards, locators and printers for dos and windows 3.1. also available are c language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers. to contact abig (the access.bus industry group): ------------------------------------------------ postal address: 370 altair way, suite 215, sunnyvale, ca 94086 internet email: abig@netcom.com fax: (408) 991-3773 voice: (408) 991-3517
this is an invitation to send articles to the informatica magazine. the first fully international issue has been published and echoes are quite favourable. for any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). dear colleague, april 25, 1993 number 1 of volume 17 of informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so. as you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, terry winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (a plan for knowledge archives project in japan and csli in stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). this structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse. a great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. this page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced ai, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. i asked professor terry winograd to write this page for number 2. i certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question. on the second page of each number an editor's profile is published. the aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. this kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live. the edited part (edited papers) is still critical. i would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. january, april, july, and october). in situation right now, i ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. a special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities. reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. you can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. on the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in informatica. we in the editorial staff will manage the rest. e-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. you can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard latex format (especially formulas). we received several final (corrected) texts in number 1 from different sites (us, russia, etc.). in this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. so, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job. at the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. the aim of informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means. sincerely yours, anton p.

in an attempt to do animation with pov i have created two little programs. one is a c program that will perform a "morph" between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. and then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. then i have a perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. i had hoped this would let me do simple animation. however, i have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. now i know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there must be another way around this. i had thought perhaps it was because i had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. however this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. any help is appreciated. ttknock@bbs.santafe.edu
i was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at nih with a database that included images in .gif format. while i have not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call an x viewer, i figure that the majority of the users here are not in an x11 environment - instead using dos and ms-kermit. with kermit supporting tek4010 emulation for graphics display, does anyone know of a package that would allow a tek to display a .gif image? it would be of more use to the local population to plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of xview or xloadimage ... andrew.

in article <1t31meinnrc8@gap.caltech.edu>, madler@cco.caltech.edu (mark adler) writes: > > can someone who knows what they're talking about add a faq entry > on gamma correction? thanks. i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program i maintain). here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions. this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq. 	graeme gill. ########################################################################### "a note on gamma correction and images" author: graeme w. gill graeme@labtam.oz.au date: 93/5/16 "what is all this gamma stuff anyway ?" -------------------------------------- although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image", there are a lot of complications. not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. gamma is one of those things. if you've ever downloaded images from bbs or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. "why is this ?" you may ask. this, is gamma correction (or the lack of it). why do we need gamma correction at all ? -------------------------------------- gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected image. this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt, you find that the crt _doesn't_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this: light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt, the image will look much too dark. to fix this up you have to "gamma correct" the image first. you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. so you have to do this to your image: gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma) for most crts, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0. if that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? ----------------------------------------------------- the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. also not all sources of images give you linear images (video cameras or video signals in general). because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are rarely sure how much. if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. if you display one of those images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt. whose fault is all this ? ----------------------- it is really three things. one is all those display programs out there that don't do gamma correction properly. another is that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gamma's. at least two file formats do the right thing. the utah graphics toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. the jfif file standard (that uses jpeg compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules). some image loaders (for instance xli - an x11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. other image viewers (eg. xv another x11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor. [ note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. you need to adjust the r, g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls. altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s. this tends to give a tint to the image. ] how can i figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? --------------------------------------------------------------------- the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering. if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.) if your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center. if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. the value will usually be around 2.2 [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the display_gamma environment variable in your .profile] how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is ? ------------------------------------------------- this is the most tricky bit. as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. it seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other. if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light. if your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok. why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing ----------------------------------------------------- one of the reason that many high quality formats (such as video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. this means images could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. the implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level. if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing. (i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance, has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image). ###########################################################################
i hope someone can help me with the following problem - i'm sure there must be a known solution. given a rectangle defined by -x <= x <= x and -y <= y <= y where x and y are constant and a parallelogram defined by -c1 <= a*x + b*y <= c1 and -c2 <= c*x + d*y <= c2 where c1, c2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. not parallel lines) ^^ not equal to what is the area of their intersection? what i'm after is some general algorithm suitable for all rectangles and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations. at the moment it looks like i'm going to have to look at all possible cases and examine each seperately e.g. 1) rectangle encloses parallelogram. 2) parallelogram encloses rectangle. 3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle ^ / \ / \ / \ y ------------------------------- y | / \ | | \ \ | | \ . \ | . origin | \ \ | | \ / | -y ------------------------------- -y -x \ / x \ / \ / " 4) two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle i hope someone can help. many thanks in advance, dave nettleton. e-mail: d.j.nettleton@durham.ac.uk ps can you please cc me any replies by e-mail.

archive-name: jpeg-faq last-modified: 16 may 1993 this faq article discusses jpeg image compression. suggestions for additions and clarifications are welcome. new since version of 2 may 1993: * added info on imageviewer for next. this article includes the following sections: [1] what is jpeg? [2] why use jpeg? [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? [4] how well does jpeg compress images? [5] what are good "quality" settings for jpeg? [6] where can i get jpeg software? [6a] "canned" software, viewers, etc. [6b] source code [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? [8] how does jpeg work? [9] what about lossless jpeg? [10] why all the argument about file formats? [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? [12] what about arithmetic coding? [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? sections 1-6 are basic info that every jpeg user needs to know; sections 7-14 are advanced info for the curious. this article is posted every 2 weeks. you can always find the latest version in the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu (18.70.0.226). by ftp, fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq; or if you don't have ftp, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with body "send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq". many other faq articles are also stored in this archive. for more instructions on use of the archive, send e-mail to the same address with the words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on separate lines. if you don't get a reply, the server may be misreading your return address; add a line such as "path myname@mysite" to specify your correct e-mail address to reply to. ---------- [1] what is jpeg? jpeg (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. jpeg is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. it does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings. jpeg does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression. standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named jbig and mpeg respectively. jpeg is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in. the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark. thus, jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans. if you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye. a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters. this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality. you can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc. conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. [2] why use jpeg? there are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.) if your viewing software doesn't support jpeg directly, you'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even with a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance). thus, using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. it's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. i'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today. furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard. [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? jpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images, gif is superior in image quality, file size, or both. one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to. as a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. jpeg is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.) gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif. jpeg can't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form. (in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they should be avoided in jpeg files.) jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc. the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't jpeg it. computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it. the same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg. you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not. if you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do. (section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. if you start from a gif, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg can only make things worse.) however, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. if you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints. be prepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not convert well. [4] how well does jpeg compress images? pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b. file	 size in bytes		comments ship.ppm	1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits 			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.z	 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress 			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. 			 other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif	 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif 			 most of the savings is the result of losing color 			 info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (see sec. 7.) ship.jpg95	 155622 cjpeg -q 95 (highest useful quality setting) 			 this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, 			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75	 58009 cjpeg -q 75 (default setting) 			 you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this 			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50	 38406 cjpeg -q 50 			 this has slight defects; if you know what to look 			 for, you could tell it's been jpeged without seeing 			 the original. still as good image quality as many 			 recent postings in usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25	 25192 cjpeg -q 25 			 jpeg's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent 			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). 			 still, i've seen plenty of usenet postings that were 			 of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o	 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) 			 blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or 			 indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny: 			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! in this case jpeg can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif, better if you have a full-color display). this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] what are good "quality" settings for jpeg? most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. "quality 95" does not mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. the default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice. this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. except for experimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality. if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand, you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation. the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg. the default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info). if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art". (note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it. other jpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.) [6] where can i get jpeg software? most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp. if you don't know how to use ftp, see the faq article "how to find sources". (if you don't have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body. the "anonymous ftp list faq" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. note: this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive. [6a] if you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc: the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. if you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. x windows: xv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other image formats. it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations. it's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z. version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking. if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg. but 2.21 works fine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg. caution: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry. another good choice for x windows is john cristy's free imagemagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z. this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software. both of the above are large, complex packages. if you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. the next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. ms-dos: this covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings. one good choice is eric praetzel's free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files. the current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. the user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei's hiview. the current version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and os/2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. for larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). you may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30). this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview, at least on my hardware. (for images larger than screen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. requires a vesa graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver, so don't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing.) a second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but i don't know any stable archive location for it. the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time. the well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest revision, 8.60a. however, cshow's jpeg implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware, $25. available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you have hi-color hardware, don't use gif as the intermediate format; try to find a targa-capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) the independent jpeg group's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will convert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats. handmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif. these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg. the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format. since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability. version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. note: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is not readable on non-pc platforms. handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images. a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. note about simtel20: the internet's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>". if you are not physically on milnet, you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives; most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics". if you have no ftp capability, you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is. microsoft windows: there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images. (windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware, due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window.) the newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. but it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... jview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can't create new jpeg files, and it doesn't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. the current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) winjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (this is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) colorview is another shareware entry ($30). this was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.) dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. os/2: the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip image archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface. strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows (see description in windows section). shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip pmview 0.85: jpeg/gif/bmp/targa/pcx viewer. gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs. has image manipulation & slideshow functions. shareware, $20. macintosh: most mac jpeg programs rely on apple's jpeg implementation, which is part of the quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed. to use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later. (if you're running system 6, you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.) you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways. with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.) mac users should keep in mind that quicktime's jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for details.) if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format. most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. the first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format. it also can convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. requires system 7 and quicktime. on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac. given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) some people like this behavior, some don't. overall, jpegview's user interface is very well thought out. gifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and pict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later. gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. also, the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it's faster with quicktime.) note: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version. jpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. this will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer. previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert. apple's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and gif format, and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime. some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse, pictpixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie, called pictcompressor, floating around the net. if you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.) storm technology's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter. this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can't use it.) you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it. if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance), gifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing. if you don't want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer. more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format. adobe photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu). you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it. amiga: (most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. it's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm, and gif images. the program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (note: although this directory is supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under amigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) viewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer. the current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha. if you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24 and viewtek. these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and imagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro), from asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas. imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support. the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats. the amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). among these are "augjpeg", "newamyjpeg", "vjpeg", and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion, anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. atari st: the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats. for monochrome st monitors, try mgif, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering. version 4.1 reads jpeg files. available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/mgif41b.zoo. i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewers for ataris, but surely there must be some by now? pointers appreciated. acorn archimedes: !changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg, although this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking. recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg, along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede, the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). there's also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. contact: dt software, freepost, cambridge, uk. tel: 0223 841099. next: imageviewer is a pd utility that displays images and can do some format conversions. the current version reads jpeg but does not write it. imageviewer is available from the standard next archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories). note that there is an older version floating around that does not support jpeg. portable software for almost any system: if none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you'll also need a viewer program. if your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image files. there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6b] if you are looking for source code to work with: free, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group, which i lead. a package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. the "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp. if you are on a pc and don't know how to cope with .tar.z format, you may prefer zip format, which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on compuserve, in the graphsupport forum (go pics), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. if you have no ftp access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (if you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the faq article "how to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.) the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg "jfif" format and image files in gif, pbmplus ppm/pgm, utah rle, and truevision targa file formats. the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. the package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays. we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg-related products. we do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details). we hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. this process is called "color quantization". (this is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term. we're stuck with the standard usage though.) clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings). since jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for *all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. this happens because jpeg's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see posted images described as "256-color jpeg". this tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif. jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for jpeg.) on the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) for purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. this is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. for this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. jpeg's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg images you already have. with a gif, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. it's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes, etc. for these people, gif is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively. thus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] how does jpeg work? the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. this article's long enough already, so i'm not going to say more than that here. for technical information, see the comp.compression faq. this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. if you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] what about lossless jpeg? there's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. however, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg algorithm, and it offers much less compression. at present, very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial. saying "-q 100" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image. what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. at this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a huffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] why all the argument about file formats? strictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of official standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems. they have defined two jpeg-based file formats: * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a "low-end" format that transports pixels and not much else. * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). tiff is a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff. it's not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff/jpeg is well defined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable. a particular case that people may be interested in is apple's quicktime software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand; see section 11 for details. another particular case is handmade software's programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format. by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by hsi. this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings. use the -j switch to get jfif output. (this applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.) [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won't read, it's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format. you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'jfif'. 2. if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a "raw jpeg" file. this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you're out of luck unless you have hsi software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they won't decompress properly with non-hsi programs. 4. a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it. 5. anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all. if you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream. if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8), try stripping off everything before that. in uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is 	"begin" line 	m_]c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with 	"begin" line 	m:'-i ... if you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files. [12] what about arithmetic coding? the jpeg spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. the choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.) unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi. thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (the "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) at least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. in particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet. there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. stay tuned for further details. [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? it would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. unfortunately this is not the case. in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical jpeg file. even this is not true; at least, not with the current free jpeg software. it's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it. in any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (if you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format (ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? as stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from, it's far better to make a jpeg from that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif. (so check the sizes too.) experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation. don't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also, don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image. while useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges). do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows system, xv's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher q setting may not be necessary.) color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store. if you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the trouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and jpeg can't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it). to get around this, you want to "smooth" the gif image before compression. smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. try "-smooth 10" or so when converting gifs. values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs. heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. if you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol... the upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net. -- 			tom lane 			organizer, independent jpeg group internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	bitnet: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie

i have posted disp140.zip to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities. i will upload this package to simtel20 later. ****** you may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use if no fee is gained. ****** there is no warranty. the author is not responsible for any damage caused by this program. important changes since version 1.35: added support for iris. support mix/concat. two images. added support for 'batch conversion'. added support for 'load/save palette table'. added support for 'edge enhance'. added support for 'crop one line'. added support for 'negate image'. new color quantization option. fix some minor bugs. (1) introduction: this program can let you read, write and display images with different formats. it also let you do some special effects(rotation, dithering ....) on image. its main purpose is to let you convert image among different formts. include simple file management system. support 'slide show'. + support 'batch conversion'. there is no limit on image size. currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. if you want to use hicolor or truecolor, you must have vesa driver. if you want to modify video driver, please read section (8). (2) hardware requirement: pc 386 or better. msdos 3.3 or higher. min amount of ram is 4m bytes(maybe less memory will also work). (i recommend min 8m bytes for better performance). hard disk for swapping(virtual memory). the following description is borrowed from djgpp. supported wares: * up to 128m of extended memory (expanded under vcpi) * up to 128m of disk space used for swapping * supervga 256-color mode up to 1024x768 * 80387 * xms & vdisk memory allocation strategies * vcpi programs, such as qemm, desqview, and 386max unsupported: * dpmi * microsoft windows features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory model, svga graphics. (3) installation: video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from djgpp. (if you use western digital vga chips, read readme.wd) (this go32.exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible with original version) *** but some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with other djgpp programs in their system. if you encounter this problem, don't put go32.exe within search path. *** please read runme.bat for how to run this program. if you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment go32. for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256 if you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment go32. for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387 **** notes: 1. i only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn. other drivers are not tested. 2. i have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. you don't need to use vesa driver. if et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn. 3. for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display, please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users). you can find vesa bios driver from : wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/graphics godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au: /kjb/mgl (4) command line switch: usage : display [-d|--display initial_display_type] [-s|--sort sort_method] [-h|-?] display type: 8(svga,default), 15, 16(hicolor), 24(truecolor) sort method: 'name', 'ext' (5) function key: f2 : change disk drive. ctrl-a -- ctrl-z : change disk drive. f3 : change filename mask. (see match.doc) f4 : change parameters. f5 : some effects on picture, eg. flip, rotate .... f7 : make directory. t : tag file. + : tag group files.

(6) support format: read: gif(.gif), japan mag(.mag), japan pic(.pic), sun raster(.ras), jpeg(.jpg), xbm(.xbm), utah rle(.rle), pbm(.pbm), pgm(.pgm), ppm(.ppm), pm(.pm), pcx(.pcx), japan mki(.mki), tiff(.tif), targa(.tga), xpm(.xpm), mac paint(.mac), gem/img(.img), iff/ilbm(.lbm), window bmp(.bmp), qrt ray tracing(.qrt), mac pict(.pct), vis(.vis), pds(.pds), viking(.vik), vicar(.vic), + fits(.fit), usenix face(.fac), iris(.sgi). the extensions in () are standard extensions. write: gif, sun raster, jpeg, xbm, pbm, pgm, ppm, pm, tiff, targa, xpm, mac paint, ascii, laser jet, iff/ilbm, window bmp, + mac pict, vis, fits, face, pcx, gem/img, iris. all read/write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither, and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format. (7) detail: initialization: set default display type to highest display type. find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only). 1. when you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. whthin this menu you can press any function key. if you move or copy files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like 'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. the header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)". d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files. pressing space in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use for reading current file. pressing return in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. this program will automatically determine which format this file is. the procedure is: first, check magic number. if fail, check standard extension. still fail, report error. pressing s or s in 'read' menu will do 'slide show'. if delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key (except escape). if any error occurs, program will make a beep. + 'w' or 'w' to pause, any key to continue. escape to terminate. pressing ins in 'read' menu will change display type. pressing alt-x in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. + pressing f5 will turn on 'effect' menu. 2. once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu. you can do special effect on image. pressing return: show image. in graphic mode, press return, space or escape to return to text mode. pressing tab: change processing target. this program allows you to do special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image. pressing left,right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits. pressing space: save current image to file. b/w dither: save as black/white image(1 bit). grey scale: save as grey image(8 bits). full color: save as color image(8 bits). true color: save as 24-bit image. this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to file. some questions are format-dependent. finally this program will prompt you a filename. if you want to save file under another directory other than current directory, please press space. after pressing space, you will enter 'write2' menu. you can change directory to what you want. then, pressing space: this program will prompt you 'original' filename. pressing return: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename (filename under bar). 3. this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. 4. this program is memory greedy. if you don't have enough memory, the performance is poor. 5. if you want to save 8 bits image : try gif then tiff(lzw) then targa then sun raster then bmp then ... if you want to save 24 bits image (lossless): try tiff(lzw) or targa or ilbm or sun raster (no one is better for true 24bits image) 6. i recommend jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images. 7. not all subroutines are fully tested 8. this document is not well written. if you have any problem, suggestion, comment about this program, please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13). i need your suggestion to improve this program. (there is no anonymous ftp on this site) (8) tech. information: program (user interface and some subroutines) written by jih-shin ho. some subroutines are borrowed from xv(2.21) and pbmplus(dec 91). tiff(v3.2) and jpeg(v4) reading/writing are through public domain libraries. compiled with djgpp. you can get whole djgpp package from simtel20 or mirror sites. for example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp (9) for thoese who want to modify video driver: 1. get grx source code from simtel20 or mirror sites. 2. for hicolor and truecolor: 15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768. 16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010. 24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018. acknowledgment: i would like to thank the authors of xv and pbmplus for their permission to let me use their subroutines. also i will thank the authors who write tiff and jpeg libraries. thank dj. without djgpp i can't do any thing on pc. jih-shin ho u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw

hi i'm new to imaging, and my advisor and i would like to do some 3d reconstructions. we take slides (biological), and image them on a 486. then the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects we want to save. the outlines are stored as a tiff file. we would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 3d image. we are unsure as to where to begin. someone mentioned that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then we could view them in autocad. any help would be greatly appreciated. pankaj oberoi spedhead@athena.mit.edu
i recently read in a book that the tiff version 6.0 specification was due to be released in the spring of 1992. i am interested in finding out about the new features of the tiff spec (and if it is out). specifically, i need to know if tiff 6.0 supports vq decompression and/or image tiling.
hello, 	does anyone know of an image format conversion tool that will convert a raw (8 bit grey scale) image to gif or tif format. it would be great if the tool ran on a pc, was a windows application, and supported other formats, but i'll be happy with anything that works. 		attn: code l10mp robert lafollette 		dahlgren division, naval surface warfare center 		dahlgren, va 22448-5000 		(703)663-4749 autovon 249-4749 		fax (703)663-4749 		email rlafoll@duchamp.nswc.navy.mil 			rlafoll@128.38.158.43

i currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any standard format. they simply contain the 8-bit pixel values. i would like to display these images on a pc. the conversion to a gif format would be helpful. this conversion can take place either on a pc or on a unix system and i could then download it to the pc. can anyone suggest where i can find software to do this? alternatively, i may have to write my own conversion program. in this case, could someone tell me where i can find the gif format specification? please e-mail me directly at: shayla@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov thanks.
hello, we are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete with source code) that will run on our unix operating system (a sequent running dynix 3.2). this graphics package must support a wide variety of character based graphics devices (pc's running a terminal emulator, primarily). at this point, x11 graphics is not an option. this graphics program should, if possible, support these sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements): 1) complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.) major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	 2) it would be nice if some limited amount of color plotting were available, if the output device supported it. we have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but gnuplot has some limitations. we are looking for something more robust than gnuplot. at this point, i'm looking for information about packages that might solve our problems. if you have any information, please contact me at the above email address. if the product you know about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number or email address so that i can contact them about pricing, etc. annette koontz battelle pacific northwest richland, wa 99352 usa

the subject says it all. i bought adobe type manager and find it completely useless. i ftped some atm fonts and couldn't install them. what's the use? are you supposed to be able to convert atm fonts to truetype? if there's anyone out there who has this program and actually finds it useful, enlighten me! pete

hello 	i have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. this i appreciated very much . i would however like to know why it is that ther is simply no information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics programmer. the subjects are 	1) how do you access the extra video memory on a video board. i know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis. i have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info i have read i am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. there is a way to do this in standard vga cause i have seen vidoe paging (written in assembly, which i don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. to get any speed at all you have to do this. how do i do it? 	2) the vesa standard. what gives here. i have read most of what the net has to offer on vesa and as far as coding for vesa goes most of the advice is cryptic at best. where do i get public domain info that will tell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work. 	my biggest gripe is about number 1. i have bought graphics books, i have asked graphics professors, i have hunted the net through both gopher, and archie, i ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information. graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios. what are all the calls folks, i know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. where are you, and why haven't you written a book yet? please help thanks in advance stephen palm palm@snycanva.bitnet (please send all personal replies to the above address, thanks)
how does the 16 bit color of hdtv work ? it can not be 5 bit red green and blue like on the macintosh. this gives only 64 gray levels. apple also has developed a point-point network that is around 200mb (not sure if it is bits or bytes) per sec. -- povl h. pedersen - macintosh specialist. knows some dos and unix too. pope@imv.aau.dk - povlphp@uts.uni-c.dk --- finger me at pope@imv.aau.dk for pgp public key ---

[....] : therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody : perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very : small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know : the wider (and original) meaning of the word. [....] unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing. what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media. from what i have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person. i, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such. following is the definition from "jargon file 2.9.10". (this is also known as the "hackers dictionary".) the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage: :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. one who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. a person capable of appreciating {hack value}. 4. a person who is good at programming quickly. 5. an expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a unix hacker'. (definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. an expert or enthusiast of any kind. one might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. hence 'password hacker', 'network hacker'. see {cracker}. the term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see {network, the} and {internet address}). it also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see {hacker ethic, the}). it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. there is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled {bogus}). see also {wannabee}. :hacker ethic, the: n. 1. the belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. the belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally) accepted among hackers. most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away free software. a few go further and assert that *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {gnu} project. sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}). on this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}. the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers. huge cooperative networks such as {usenet}, {fidonet} and internet (see {internet address}) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset. : finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is : a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : to me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says "nahh, i just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-) note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so. there are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'. so, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace. (this means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.) sometimes, there may only be one such person. : >no matter what mr. dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. : actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-) language works anyway that we want it to work. the purpose of language is to communicate. to oversimplify: as long as communication is taking place, then language is working. -- |================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=============| | "amiga: the computer for the creative mind" (tm) commodore /// weber state | | "macintosh: the computer for the rest of us"(tm) apple \\\/// university | |== "i think, therefore i amiga" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= ogden ut usa =|
