archive-name: space/controversy last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:06 $ controversial questions these issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being offered. the summaries below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community has settled. please don't bring them up again unless there's something truly new to be discussed. the net can't set public policy, that's what your representatives are for. what happened to the saturn v plans despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the saturn v blueprints have not been lost. they are kept at marshall space flight center on microfilm. the problem in re-creating the saturn v is not finding the drawings, it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and vab have been converted to space shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from. by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design. why data from space missions isn't immediately available investigators associated with nasa missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. however, nasa frequently releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early in a mission. risks of nuclear (rtg) power sources for space probes there has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous. numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small. two interesting data points are (1) the may 1968 loss of two snap 19b2 rtgs, which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather satellite failed to reach orbit. the fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium. (2) in april 1970, the apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its snap 27 rtg heat source, which was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean. the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [doe 1980]. to make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to pursue are: a good review of the technical facts and issues is given by daniel salisbury in "radiation risk and planetary exploration-- the rtg controversy," *planetary report*, may-june 1987, pages 3-7. another good article, which also reviews the events preceding galileo's launch, "showdown at pad 39-b," by robert g. nichols, appeared in the november 1989 issue of *ad astra*.

see the rogers commission report, for example. what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart. the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the kerwin team's medical/forensic report. the astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200mph, and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater. their remains were recovered, and after the kerwin team examined them, they were sent off to be buried. using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can't get there. it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks. furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth. the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth's surface and low orbit. taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful. a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft. [yet another concise answer by henry spencer.] the "face on mars" there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face. it appears in two different frames of viking orbiter imagery: 35a72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often published, with the sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70a13 (with the sun 27 degrees from the west). science writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization. most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental. other viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere on mars. there exists a mars anomalies research society (sorry, don't know the address) to study the face. the mars observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years. in the meantime, speculation about the face is best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or sci.astro. v. dipeitro and g. molenaar, *unusual martian surface features*, mars research, p.o. box 284, glen dale, maryland, usa, 1982. $18 by mail. r.r. pozos, *the face of mars*, chicago review press, 1986.

archive-name: space/astronaut last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $ how to become an astronaut first the short form, authored by henry spencer, then an official nasa announcement. q. how do i become an astronaut? a. we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut, since it's probably impossible for a non-russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to win a lottery. becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you want to do it anyway. so you want to become a shuttle "mission specialist". if you aren't a us citizen, become one; that is a must. after that, the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply. nasa's problem is not finding qualified people, but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	it is not enough to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason, many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job. get a ph.d. specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil. forget computer programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore- seeable future. degree(s) in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner. be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes, and long-term effects are poorly understood. for that matter, avoid any other significant medical unknowns.) if you can pass a jet-pilot physical, you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor. practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants. (and, also, that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired: public relations is a significant part of the job, and nasa's image is very prim and proper.) the image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie. remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point, and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent. keep your nose clean. get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby; experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs. work for nasa; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988, 43 were military or nasa employees, and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison (the first black female astronaut). if you apply from outside nasa and miss, but they offer you a job at nasa, ***take it***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first". think space: they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation. keep trying. many astronauts didn't make it the first time. nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b. johnson space center houston, texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates ================================================================== astronaut candidate program --------------------------- the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has a need for pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program. nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed. persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered. all positions are located at the lyndon b. johnson space center in houston, texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation program. space shuttle program description --------------------------------- the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine. the space shuttle orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew. the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials processing, manufacturing), and other operations. these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station. the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself. users of the space shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries. the crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot, and three mission specialists. on occasion additional crew members are assigned. the commander, pilot, and mission specialists are nasa astronauts. pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots. during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle, crew, mission success and safety in flight. the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. in addition, the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other payload operations. mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot, have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and experiment and payload operations. mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems, as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. mission specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific experimental operations. astronaut candidate program =========================== basic qualification requirements -------------------------------- applicants must meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application. mission specialist astronaut candidate: 1. bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. an advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). quality of academic preparation is important. 2. ability to pass a nasa class ii space physical, which is similar to a civilian or military class ii flight physical and includes the following specific standards: 	 distant visual acuity: 	 20/150 or better uncorrected, 	 correctable to 20/20, each eye. 	 blood pressure: 	 140/90 measured in sitting position. 3. height between 58.5 and 76 inches. pilot astronaut candidate: 1. bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. an advanced degree is desirable. quality of academic preparation is important. 2. at least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. flight test experience highly desirable. 3. ability to pass a nasa class i space physical which is similar to a military or civilian class i flight physical and includes the following specific standards: 	 distant visual acuity: 	 20/50 or better uncorrected 	 correctable to 20/20, each eye. 	 blood pressure: 	 140/90 measured in sitting position. 4. height between 64 and 76 inches. citizenship requirements applications for the astronaut candidate program must be citizens of the united states. note on academic requirements applicants for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions -- specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics. the following degree fields, while related to engineering and the sciences, are not considered qualifying: - degrees in technology (engineering technology, aviation technology, 	medical technology, etc.) - degrees in psychology (except for clinical psychology, physiological 	psychology, or experimental psychology which are qualifying). - degrees in nursing. - degrees in social sciences (geography, anthropology, archaeology, etc.) - degrees in aviation, aviation management or similar fields. application procedures ---------------------- civilian the application package may be obtained by writing to: 	nasa johnson space center 	astronaut selection office 	attn: ahx 	houston, tx 77058 civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. when nasa decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made. applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection. applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program. those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration, and their applications will not be retained. after the preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted. active duty military active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to nasa. application procedures will be disseminated by each service. selection --------- personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration. once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process. selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment. general program requirements selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center, houston, texas. the astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs. they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during their candidate period. applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut. final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and evaluation period. civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for a period of at least five years. civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time. successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a specified tour of duty. nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates. therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply. pay and benefits ---------------- civilians salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs-11 through gs-14, and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience. other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and participation in group health and life insurance plans. military selected military personnel will be detailed to the johnson space center but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and other similar military matters. next: faq #15/15 -

archive-name: space/intro last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $ frequently asked questions on sci.space/sci.astro introduction this series of linked messages is periodically posted to the usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. if you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (jon leech). if you don't want to see the faq, add 'frequently asked questions' to your kill file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck). the faq volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. the faq postings are available in the ames space archive in faq/faq<#>. good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. the point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. better to build on top than start again. nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. references are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization. questions fall into three basic types: 1) where do i find some information about space? try your local public library first. the net is not a good place to ask for general information. ask individuals (by email) if you must. there are other sources, use them, too. the net is a place for open ended discussion. 2) i have an idea which would improve space flight? hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before. again, contact a direct individual source for evaluation. nasa fields thousands of these each day. 3) miscellanous queries. these are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of faq postings. suggestions for better netiquette read news.announce.newusers if you're on usenet. minimize cross references, [do you really need to?] edit "subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent. send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth 	100 posts). internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to space-request 	not space. read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (check all 	references.) cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're 	responding to; remove signatures and headers). summarize! put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail 	or article), state your institution, etc. don't assume the 	'reply' function of mailers will work. use absolute dates. post in a timely way. don't post what everyone 	will get on tv anyway. some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: 	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ascii terminals 	(use carriage returns). index to linked postings i've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. there isn't a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each posting. only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to sci.astro (indicated by '*' following the posting number). #	contents 1*	introduction 	 suggestions for better netiquette 	 index to linked postings 	 notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc. 	 contributors 2*	network resources 	 overview 	 mailing lists 	 periodically updated information 	 warning about non-public networks 3*	online (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc. 	 introduction 	 viewing images 	 online archives 		nasa ames 		nasa astrophysics data system 		nasa jet propulsion lab (mission information and images) 		nasa langley (technical reports) 		nasa spacelink 		national space science data center 		space telescope science institute electronic info. service 		starcat 		astronomical databases 		astronomy programs 		orbital element sets 		space digest 	 landsat & nasa photos 	 planetary maps 	 cometary orbits 4*	performing calculations and interpreting data formats 	 computing spacecraft orbits and trajectories 	 computing planetary positions 	 computing crater diameters from earth-impacting asteroids 	 map projections and spherical trignometry 	 performing n-body simulations efficiently 	 interpreting the fits image format 	 sky (unix ephemeris program) 	 three-dimensional star/galaxy coordinates 5*	references on specific areas 	 publishers of space/astronomy material 	 careers in the space industry 	 dc-x single-stage to orbit (ssto) program 	 how to name a star after a person 	 llnl "great exploration" 	 lunar prospector 	 lunar science and activities 	 orbiting earth satellite histories 	 spacecraft models 	 rocket propulsion 	 spacecraft design 	 esoteric propulsion schemes (solar sails, lasers, fusion...) 	 spy satellites 	 space shuttle computer systems 	 seti computation (signal processing) 	 amateur satellies & weather satellites 	 tides 6*	constants and equations for calculations 7*	astronomical mnemonics 8	contacting nasa, esa, and other space agencies/companies 	 nasa centers / arianespace / esa / nasda / soyuzkarta / space 		camp / space commerce corporation / spacehab / spot image 	 other commercial space businesses 9	space shuttle answers, launch schedules, tv coverage 	 shuttle launchings and landings; schedules and how to see them 	 why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff? 	 how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select 	 amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions 	 solid rocket booster fuel composition 10	planetary probes -

network resources
archive-name: space/net last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $ network resources overview you may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. in general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three categories: internet, usenet, or bitnet. electronic mail may be sent between these networks, and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers'. the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them. one mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. in addition to the general lists for space (called space digest for internet users, and space on bitnet), there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below. a second mechanism is usenet 'netnews'. this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net. netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name'. the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro', and 'talk.politics.space'. contributors 'post' submissions (called 'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends it to other nearby machines. similarly, articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted. gateway machines redirect the usenet sci.space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa; the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists. if you can receive netnews, its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option. mailing lists space digest is the main internet list, and is now being run by the international space university (in only its second change of management in over a decade). email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body should be in the format 'subscribe space john public') to join. note that the moderated space magazine list is defunct at present for lack of a moderator. old copies of space digest since its inception in 1981 are available by anonymous ftp. retrieve 	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/spacedigestarchive/readme for further details. elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of space shuttle keplerian elements before and during shuttle flights. nasa two line elements are sent out on the list from dr. kelso, jsc, and other sources as they are released. email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join. gps digest is a moderated list for discussion of the global positioning system and other satellite navigation positioning systems. email to gps-request@esseye.si.com to join. space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in space-related companies. email vincent cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join. space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics; discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. email to space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. archives of old digests and selected excerpts are available by anonymous ftp from gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech, or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have ftp access. seds-l is a bitnet list for members of students for the exploration and development of space and other interested parties. email listserv@tamvm1.bitnet with a message saying "subscribe seds-l your name". email saying "index seds-l" to list the archive contents. sedsnews is a bitnet list for news items, press releases, shuttle status reports, and the like. this duplicates material which is also found in space digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. email listserv@tamvm1.bitnet saying "subscribe sedsnews your name" to join. email saying "index sedsnews" to list the archive contents. ron baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which carries the contents of the sci.space.news usenet group. email him to join the list. as a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a mailing list. space digest, for example, relays many inappropriate 'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list address rather than the request address. periodically updated information in addition to this faq list, a broad variety of topical information is posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group sci.space.news created for this purpose). please remember that the individuals posting this information are performing a service for all net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests. acronyms 	garrett wollman (wollman@uvm.edu) posts an acronym list around the 	first of each month. astro-ftp list

from _space calendar_ magazine. warning about non-public networks (included at the suggestion of eugene miya, who wrote the item) nasa has an internal system of unclassified electronic mail and bulletin boards. this system is not open for public use. specifically, nasa personnel and procurement operations are regarded with some sensitivity. contractors must renegotiate their contracts. the fair and open procurement act does not look kindly to those having inside information. contractors and outsiders caught using this type of information can expect severe penalities. unauthorized access attempts may subject you to a fine and/or imprisonment in accordance with title 18, usc, section 1030. if in fact you should should learn of unauthorized access, contact nasa personnel. claims have been made on this news group about fraud and waste. none have ever been substantiated to any significant degree. readers detecting fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement should contact the nasa inspector general (24-hours) at 800-424-9183 (can be anonymous) or write 	nasa 	inspector general 	p.o. box 23089 	l'enfant plaza station 	washington dc 20024 next: faq #3/15 - online (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc.
archive-name: space/data last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $ online and other sources of images, data, etc. introduction a wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net. a few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the remainder support some form of file transfer. many sites are listed as providing 'anonymous ftp'. this refers to the file transfer protocol on the internet. sites not connected to the internet cannot use ftp directly, but there are a few automated ftp servers which operates via email. send mail containing only the word help to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions on how to make requests. the sources with the broadest selection of material are the nasa ames space archive and the national space science data center. don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. the data volume is huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it. viewing images the possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly large, and i won't attempt to cover common formats (gif, etc.) here. to read pds and vicar (and many other) formats on unix systems running x, use xv 2.11, available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.z and the other standard x11 ftp sites. the faq for the usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image formats and how to get image viewing software. a copy of this document is available by anonymous ftp from the usenet faq archives at pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures. online archives nasa ames extensive archives are maintained at nasa ames and are available via anonymous ftp or an email server. these archives include many images and a wide variety of documents including this faq list, nasa press releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. please note that these are not maintained on an official basis. ftp users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in pub/space. pub/space/index contains a listing of files available in the archive (the index is about 200k by itself). to access the archives by email, send a letter to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). in the subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like: 	send space index 	send space shuttle/ss01.23.91. the capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. all are in caps. only text files are handled by the email server at present; use one of the ftp email servers described in the introduction to this section for images or programs. the magellan venus and voyager jupiter, saturn, and uranus cd-rom image disks have been put online in the cdrom and cdrom2 directories. the disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. thousands of images are available in these collections. the gif directory contains images in gif

which is easy to use and provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data from nasa data centers across the country. it currently has over 140 data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, uv, and x-ray data which can be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. the ads also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. in addition, ads has a beta version of an abstracts service which allows users to query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors, keywords, title words, or abstract text words. ads use requires direct internet access. for more info and to sign up to become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. the user's guide and "quickstart" guide are available by anonymous ftp to sao-ftp.harvard.edu in directory

space flight center in huntsville, alabama. the system is specifically designed for teachers. the data base is arranged to provide easy access to current and historical information on nasa aeronautics, space research, and technology transfer information. also included are suggested classroom activities that incorporate information on nasa projects to teach a number of scientific principles. unlike bulletin board systems, nasa spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. however it does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments for nasa which may be answered by regular mail. messages are answered electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by mail. messages are generally handled the next working day except during missions when turnaround times increase. the mail system is closed-loop between the user and nasa. spacelink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs useful for science educators as well as space graphics and gif images from nasa's planetary probes and the hubble telescope. you can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(v.32) baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop

(you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch. the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam. watch for the difference between the "top" [orbiter side] and the "bottom" [external tank side] of the stack.) the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v's. (a side note: the saturn v's also had a roll program. don't ask me why -- i'm a shuttle guy.) i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.	he added that the "roll maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated. the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance. the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination. the total maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array. how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder 13, c-band, 72 degrees west longitude, audio 6.8, frequency 3960 mhz. f2r is stationed over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g. shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite for these viewers. if you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select. it's worth asking if yours doesn't. the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions are not being covered. amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions the following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio: 	w6fxn - los angeles 	k6mf - ames research center, mountain view, california 	wa3nan - goddard space flight center (gsfc), greenbelt, maryland. 	w5rrr - johnson space center (jsc), houston, texas 	w6vio - jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), pasadena, california. 	w1aw voice bulletins 	station vhf	 10m	 15m	 20m	 40m	 80m 	------	 ------ ------ ------ ------ -----	----- 	w6fxn	 145.46 	k6mf	 145.585			 7.165	3.840 	wa3nan	 147.45 28.650 21.395 14.295 7.185	3.860 	w5rrr	 146.64 28.400 21.350 14.280 7.227	3.850 	w6vio	 224.04		 21.340 14.270 	w6vio	 224.04		 21.280 14.282 7.165	3.840 	w1aw		 28.590 21.390 14.290 7.290	3.990 w5rrr transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the other frequencies supplying keplerian elements and mission information. w1aw also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. no mission audio but they transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 utc. frequencies in the 10-20m bands require usb and frequencies in the 40 and 80m bands lsb. use fm for the vhf frequencies.

archive-name: space/probe last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $ planetary probes - historical missions this section was lightly adapted from an original posting by larry klaes (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. matthew wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on voyager, and the section on sakigake was obtained from isas material posted by yoshiro yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). us planetary missions mariner (venus, mars, & mercury flybys and orbiters) mariner 1, the first u.s. attempt to send a spacecraft to venus, failed minutes after launch in 1962. the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the onboard computer took control. however, there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the range safety officer destroyed it. although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement, it was actually a transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted from the expression "r-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative of radius). this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation. mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot (800 degrees fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees f.) world with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978). mariner 3, launched on november 5, 1964, was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space. unable to collect the sun's energy for power from its solar panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit. it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4. mariner 4, the sister probe to mariner 3, did reach mars in 1965 and took the first close-up images of the martian surface (22 in all) as it flew by the planet. the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought. many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a "dead" world in both the geological and biological sense. mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967. it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2, plus the information that venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface of an ocean. mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by mariner 4 four years earlier. however, they failed to take away the concept of mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic measurements of mariner 4. mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed. mariner 9, the sister probe to mariner 8, became the first craft to orbit mars in 1971. it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once flowed across the planet. the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars' two small moons, phobos and deimos. mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974. the probe did return the first close-up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover, plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days. mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought. this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet. pioneer (moon, sun, venus, jupiter, and saturn flybys and orbiters) pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph the moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon, including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth. all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers. pioneer 1 was launched on october 11, 1958, pioneer 2 on november 8, and pioneer 3 on december 6. pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u.s. spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959. pioneer 5 was originally designed to flyby venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to 36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until mariner 2. pioneer 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: pioneer 6, 7, and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. pioneer e (would have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969. pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973. pioneer 11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in 1979. both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever to do so. pioneer venus 1 (1978) (also known as pioneer venus orbiter, or pioneer 12) burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8, 1992. pvo made the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. pioneer venus 2 (also known as pioneer 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of 1978. the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface. though none were expected to survive to the surface, the day probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed. ranger (lunar lander and impact missions) ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series. they were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed. ranger 3, launched on january 26, 1962, was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon, but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit. ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by, but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt. ranger 4, launched april 23, 1962, had the same purpose as ranger 3, but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside, the first u.s. probe to reach the moon, albeit without returning data. ranger 5, launched october 18, 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4, lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit. ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon. ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate. ranger 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first u.s. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965. lunar orbiter (lunar surface photography) lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of 1969-1972. the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside. all five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were essentially successful in their missions. they were the first u.s. probes to orbit the moon. all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions. surveyor (lunar soft landers) the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing vehicle). surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968. only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. the rest became the first u.s. probes to soft land on the moon, taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis. apollo 12 landed 600 feet from surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth. surveyor 7, the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in 1968. viking (mars orbiters and landers) viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral, florida on august 20, 1975 on a titan 3e-centaur d1 rocket. the probe went into martian orbit on june 19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july 20, 1976. it soon began its programmed search for martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings. one thing scientists learned was that mars' sky was pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere). the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image. the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7, 1980, when it ran out of attitude-control propellant. the lander was switched into a weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994; but after november 13, 1982, an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders. communication was never regained again, despite the engineers' efforts through may of 1983. an interesting side note: viking 1's lander has been designated the thomas a. mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team. the national air and space museum in washington, d.c. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition. viking 2 was launched on september 9, 1975, and arrived in martian orbit on august 7, 1976. the lander touched down on september 3, 1976 in utopia planitia. it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording one marsquake. the orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in 1978, which prompted it being shut down that july. the lander was shut down on april 12, 1980. the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025. voyager (outer planet flybys) voyager 1 was launched september 5, 1977, and flew past jupiter on march 5, 1979 and by saturn on november 13, 1980. voyager 2 was launched august 20, 1977 (before voyager 1), and flew by jupiter on august 7, 1979, by saturn on august 26, 1981, by uranus on january 24, 1986, and by neptune on august 8, 1989. voyager 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet. voyager 1 could, in principle, have headed towards pluto, but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up. between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their satellites, and their rings has become immense. voyager 1&2 discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and aurorae. three new satellites were discovered. two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes, with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere. when the two probes reached saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable. the weather was tame compared with jupiter: massive jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known). titan's atmosphere was smoggy. mimas' appearance was startling: one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance. the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. braids, kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain. voyager 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts, continued the mission to uranus and neptune. uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance. one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis, giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. icy channels were found on ariel, and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered. in contrast to uranus, neptune was found to have rather active weather, including numerous cloud features. the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring. two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were discovered. neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers. (what's liquid at 38k?) the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades. their on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto. their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause. soviet planetary missions since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon, venus, and mars, i will highlight only the primary missions: soviet lunar probes luna 1 - lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed moon and became first 	 craft in solar orbit. luna 2 - first craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959. luna 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1959. zond 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since luna 3. was 	 also a test for future mars missions. luna 9 - first probe to soft land on the moon in 1966, returned images 	 from surface. luna 10 - first probe to orbit the moon in 1966. luna 13 - second successful soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966. zond 5 - first successful circumlunar craft. zond 6 through 8 	 accomplished similar missions through 1970. the probes were 	 unmanned tests of a manned orbiting soyuz-type lunar vehicle. luna 16 - first probe to land on moon and return samples of lunar soil 	 to earth in 1970. luna 20 accomplished similar mission in 	 1972. luna 17 - delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon's 	 surface, lunokhod 1, in 1970. a similar feat was accomplished 	 with luna 21/lunokhod 2 in 1973. luna 24 - last soviet lunar mission to date. returned soil samples in 	 1976. soviet venus probes venera 1 - first acknowledged attempt at venus mission. transmissions 	 lost enroute in 1961. venera 2 - attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with 	 venera 3. probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in 	 february of 1966. no images were returned. venera 3 - attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface. 	 transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe 	 became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966. venera 4 - first probe to successfully return data while descending 	 through venusian atmosphere. crushed by air pressure before 	 reaching surface in 1967. venera 5 and 6 mission profiles 	 similar in 1969. venera 7 - first probe to return data from the surface of another planet 	 in 1970. venera 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 	 1972. venera 9 - sent first image of venusian surface in 1975. was also the 	 first probe to orbit venus. venera 10 accomplished similar 	 mission. venera 13 - returned first color images of venusian surface in 1982. 		venera 14 accomplished similar mission. venera 15 - accomplished radar mapping with venera 16 of sections of 		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than pvo. vega 1 - accomplished with vega 2 first balloon probes of venusian 	 atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. flyby buses went on 	 to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close-up in 	 march of 1986. soviet mars probes mars 1 - first acknowledged mars probe in 1962. transmissions ceased 	 enroute the following year. zond 2 - first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian 	 surface. probe signals ceased enroute in 1965. mars 2 - first soviet mars probe to land - albeit crash - on martian 	 surface. orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red 	 planet in 1971. mars 3 - first successful soft landing on martian surface, but lander 	 signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971. mars 4 - attempt at orbiting mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to 	 fire, probe went on into solar orbit. mars 5 - first fully successful soviet mars mission, orbiting mars in 	 1974. returned images of martian surface comparable to u.s. 	 probe mariner 9. mars 6 - landing attempt in 1974. lander crashed into the surface. mars 7 - lander missed mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit 	 with its flyby bus. phobos 1 - first attempt to land probes on surface of mars' largest 	 moon, phobos. probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 	 human/computer error. phobos 2 - attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos. the probe did 	 enter mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week 	 before scheduled phobos landing. while there has been talk of soviet jupiter, saturn, and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have yet been taken with these projects. more intensive studies of the moon, mars, venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003. how the many changes in the former soviet union (now the commonwealth of independent states) will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen. japanese planetary missions sakigake (ms-t5) was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january 8 1985, and approached halley's comet within about 7 million km on march 11, 1986. the spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of which work normally now, so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. the closest approach was at 23h08m47s (jst=utc+9h) on january 8, 1992. the geocentric distance was 88,997 km. this is the first planet-swingby for a japanese spacecraft. during the approach, sakigake observed the geotail. some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence. the second earth-swingby will be on june 14, 1993 (at 40 re (earth's radius)), and the third october 28, 1994 (at 86 re). hiten, a small lunar probe, was launched into earth orbit on january 24, 1990. the spacecraft was then known as muses-a, but was renamed to hiten once in orbit. the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite, hagoromo. japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon, joining the unites states and ussr. the smaller spacecraft, hagoromo, remained in orbit around the moon. an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it. hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on march 19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera (105-cm, f3.1) at the kiso observatory in japan. hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth's atmosphere. hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 jst (utc+9h) on february 15, 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3n, 9.7e) and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit. the following is the orbital calculation results after the approach: 	apoapsis altitude: about 49,400 km 	periapsis altitude: about 9,600 km 	inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) 	period		: 4.7 days planetary mission references i also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three groups: general overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes. this list is by no means complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject. if anyone can add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated. though naturally i recommend all the books listed below, i think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area. i also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date general works on astronomy and the sol system, to give you some extra background. most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library. some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market bookstore. general overviews (in alphabetical order by author): j. kelly beatty et al, the new solar system, 1990. merton e. davies and bruce c. murray, the view from space: photographic

records placed on voyager 1 and 2 in case the probes are found by intelligences in interstellar space, as well as the probes and planetary mission objectives themselves.) other works and periodicals: nasa has published very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched. good university libraries will carry these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission you wish to read about. i recommend these works after you first study some of the books listed above. some periodicals i recommend for reading on space probes are national geographic, which has written articles on the pioneer probes to earth's moon luna and the jovian planets jupiter and saturn, the ranger, surveyor, lunar orbiter, and apollo missions to luna, the mariner missions to mercury, venus, and mars, the viking probes to mars, and the voyager missions to jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune. more details on american, soviet, european, and japanese probe missions can be found in sky and telescope, astronomy, science, nature, and scientific american magazines. time, newsweek, and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions, but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. space missions are affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you probably know. depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you might also wish to join the planetary society, one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. their periodical, the planetary report, details the latest space probe missions. write to the planetary society, 65 north catalina avenue, pasadena, california 91106 usa. good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. i personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive

archive-name: space/new_probes last-modified: $date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $ upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below would be welcome. sources: nasa fact sheets, cassini mission design team, isas/nasda launch schedules, press kits. asuka (astro-d) - isas (japan) x-ray astronomy satellite, launched into earth orbit on 2/20/93. equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 angstrom) x-ray telescope, x-ray ccd cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters. cassini - saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe. cassini is a joint nasa/esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv/centaur in october of 1997. after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn's atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn's satellites, and characterize titan's atmosphere and surface. one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere. the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan and first described the true nature of saturn's rings. 	 key scheduled dates for the cassini mission

topex/poseidon project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. the satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean. ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over its poles. launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera. since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in february 1992. this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun's south pole in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 au-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the sun than the earth is! while in jupiter's neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment. for a short summary of these results, see *science*, v. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 september 1992). for gory technical detail, see the many articles in the same issue. other space science missions (note:

(800)-usa-maps. they can quote you a price and tell you where to send your money. expect a 6-8 week turnaround time. a much faster way (about 1 week) is through timely discount topos, (303)-469-5022, 9769 w. 119th drive, suite 9, broomfield, co 80021. call them and tell them what you want. they'll quote a price, you send a check, and then they go to usgs customer service counter and pick it up for you. add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping. a (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is: 	r. miller and f. reddy, "mapping the world in pascal", 	byte v12 #14, december 1987 	contains turbo pascal procedures for five common map projections. a 	demo program, cartog.pas, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data 	is available on compuserve, genie, and many bbss. some references for spherical trignometry are: 	_spherical astronomy_, w.m. smart, cambridge u. press, 1931. 	_a compendium of spherical astronomy_, s. newcomb, dover, 1960. 	_spherical astronomy_, r.m. green, cambridge u. press., 1985 (update 	of smart). 	_spherical astronomy_, e woolard and g.clemence, academic 	press, 1966. performing n-body simulations efficiently 	"computer simulation using particles" 	r. w. hockney and j. w. eastwood 	(adam hilger; bristol and philadelphia; 1988) 	"the rapid evaluation of potential fields in particle systems", 	l. greengard 	mit press, 1988. 	 a breakthrough o(n) simulation method. has been parallelized. 	l. greengard and v. rokhlin, "a fast algorithm for particle 	simulations," journal of computational physics, 73:325-348, 1987.

archive-name: space/acronyms edition: 8 acronym list for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle: edition 8, 1992 dec 7 last posted: 1992 aug 27 this list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups. if i forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know! also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if i can figure it out, i'll add it to the list. note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic. if i incorporated every acronym i ever saw, i'd soon run out of disk space! :-) the list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days. all comments regarding it are welcome; i'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu. note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*! note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing. thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to garrett a. wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to daniel fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly huge list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in german (which i read, fortunately). special thanks this time to ken hollis at nasa, who sent me a copy of nasa reference publication 1059 revised: _space transportation system and associated payloads: glossary, acronyms, and abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of tlas. special bonus! at the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than larry wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

"demand and supply balance will collapse" is nonsense. supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price. is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? not bloody likely. new nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate. uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency. 	paul f. dietz 	dietz@cs.rochester.edu

this might a real wierd idea or maybe not.. i have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls... why not do the same thing for a space station.. fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons, spin then around (i know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station.. of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe.. maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..) sorry for any spelling errors, i missed school today..

suppose the soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working and had made it first. they could have beaten us if either: * their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back, and/or * a saturn v went boom. if they had beaten us, i speculate that the us would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in earth orbit and on the moon). whether or not we would be on mars by now would depend upon whether the soviets tried to go. setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and i think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to mars (at least in the short run). thus we would have concentrated on the moon. /~~~(-: james t. green :-)~~~~(-: jgreen@oboe.calpoly.edu :-)~~~\ | "i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving	| | the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the 	| | moon and returning him safely to the earth." 		| | <john f. kennedy; may 25, 1961> 		|

i had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in first and second grade (69-70, 70-71). they came in chocolate, strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed like space foil at the time). the taste is hard to describe, although i remember it fondly. it was most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "power bar." sort of a toffee injected with vitamins. the chocolate power bar is a rough approximation of the taste. strawberry sucked. man, these were my "60's." -- gavin helf uc berkeley political science berkeley-stanford program in soviet studies ghelf@violet.berkeley.edu

ssf is up for redesign again. let's do it right this time! let's step back and consider the functionality we want: [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach, explified by shuttle and ssf so far, was to centralize functionality. these projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and ssf has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication. over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization. meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation. firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the gps/navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in clarke and molniya orbits, etc. secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed. ssf's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization. [1] we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: comet and mir for long-duration flights, shuttle/spacelab for short-duration flights. the best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of u.s. facilities on mir, shuttle/mir linkup, and transition from shuttle/spacelab to a much less expensive ssto/spacehab/comet or ssto/sif/comet. we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation van allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails. the comet system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo. [2] we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of leo. this is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude. furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size. so i propose labratsat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-van-allen-belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on earth-moon, earth-mars, earth-asteroid, etc. trips. the miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a vr interface. after several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts. [3] by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in clarke orbit. i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills. once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc. once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards. by applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost. for a fraction of ssf's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits. n.b., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality. mars network and artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return. the descendants of labratsat's technology can be used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on mars at low cost. -- nick szabo					 szabo@techboook.com

sterrenkundig symposium 'compacte objecten' op 26 april 1993 in het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de universiteit van utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. aert jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond. de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het sterrekundig instituut utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de studium generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dies natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. er staat echter meer op stapel. studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. de onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. in de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. ook andere belangstellenden zijn van harte welkom! tijdens de lezing van prof. kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de radiosterrenwacht westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, westerbork en utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. prof. kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. de op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 watt een seconde te laten branden! tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren. deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op abn-amro rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 jus. het gironummer van de abn-amro bank utrecht is 2900. bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de nnv. na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren. het symposium vindt plaats in transitorium i, universiteit utrecht. voor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij henrik spoon, p/a s.r.o.n., sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 ca utrecht. tel.: 030-535722. e-mail: henriks@sron.ruu.nl. ******* dagprogramma ************************************** 9:30 ontvangst met koffie & thee 10:00 opening prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers (utrecht) 10:10 dubbelster evolutie prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers 10:25 radiopulsars prof. dr. j.m.e. kuijpers (utrecht) 11:00 pulsars in dubbelster systemen prof. dr. f. verbunt (utrecht) 11:50 massa & straal van neutronensterren prof. dr. j. van paradijs (amsterdam) 12:25 theorie van accretieschijven drs. r.f. van oss (utrecht) 13:00 lunch 14:00 hoe zien accretieschijven er werkelijk uit? dr. r.g.m. rutten (amsterdam) 14:35 snelle fluktuaties bij accretie op neutronensterren en zwarte gaten dr. m. van der klis (amsterdam) 15:10 thee & koffie 15:30 zwarte gaten: knippen en plakken met ruimte en tijd prof. dr. v. icke (leiden) 16:05 afsluiting 16:25 borrel -- gert-jan van lochem	 \\		"what is it?" fysische informatica	 \\	"something blue" universiteit utrecht \\	"shapes, i need shapes!" 030-532803			\\			- hhgg -

what would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (martin mariatta, boeing, mcdonell douglas, general dynamics, lockheed, rockwell) getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say $3million to do that. recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability? you get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...) then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, i know... but at least its an example...) to develop between 3 and 5 craft designs. then to take all of those designs, and figure out exactly what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today. and lets say that this portion again funded by the gov cost about $20 million. and from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street, and saying "i want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers that show %20 roi, fund me...) now many of you think that this is a joke, but i have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. it seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (nasp, nls, als, dcy?, etc...) they need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation. they have also learned that design requirements that are phony (i.e. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a real requirement. any feedback? 			john.
the following are my thoughts on a meeting that i, hugh kelso, and bob lilly had with an aide of sen. patty murrays. we were there to discuss ssto, and commercial space. this is how it went... after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto, i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator (d) patty murray, washington state. i started asking for an hour, and when i heard the gasp on the end of the phone, i quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. later in that conversation, i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes. we got the standard bozo treatment. that is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material. well, i got allocated 1/2 hour with sen. murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. we covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific. most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer. there was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that we brought up. but, with murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (i.e. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. so, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to leo. solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. we hit the tourism angle, and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after seeing the smog over l.a. we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had potential to lead to understanding of, and maybe a cure for osteoporosis. we hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed. we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle. we hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc... jobs provided in those sectors. jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs. we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do. and he asked questions on this point. we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to leo. in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was very interested in it. he asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there. the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers. then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself. he said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days. all in all we felt like we did a pretty good job. 			john.

(exactly if you use newcomb's numbers rather than leverrier's.) of course not everybody believes einstein, and that's fine. but subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than mercury using radar have been fruitless. -bill gawne "forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe." - g. j. caesar any opinions are my own. nothing in this post constitutes an official statement from any person or organization.

i am sure mary or henry can describe this more aptly then me. but here is how i understand it. at speed, near supersonic. the wind behaves like a fluid pipe. it becomes incompressible. so wind has to bend away from the wing edges. as the wing thickens, the more the pipes bend. if they have no place to go, they begin to stall, and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (high drag). if you squeeze the fuselage, so that these pipes have aplace to bend into, then drag is reduced. essentially, teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage. that is where the wings are subtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage. pat

nasa headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). i've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this. gibbons outlines space station redesign guidance dr. john h. gibbons, director, office of science and technology policy, outlined to the members-designate of the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station. a low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds. over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the nasa budget for the president's new technology investment. as a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the nasa budget. for example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the nasa budget over the next 5 years. gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. they also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider. gibbons also announced that the united states and its international partners -- the europeans, japanese, and canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process. to that end, the russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems. the u.s. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology. the overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal. gibbons reiterated that, "president clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. however, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation." nasa administrator daniel s. goldin said the russian participation will be accomplished through the east- west space science center at the university of maryland under the leadership of roald sagdeev.

"space station redesign leader says cost goal may be impossible" today (4/6) the washington post ran an article with the headline shown above. the article starts with "a leader of the nasa team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible." o'connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research "is a real question for me." o'connor said "everything is fair game," including "dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some nasa facilities around the country, working closely with the russian space station mir, and using unmanned titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet." o'connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost. the post says o'connor described the design derived from the current ssf as a high cost option (i believe kathy sawyer, the post writer, got confused here. i listened in on part of o'connor's briefing to the press on monday, and in one part of the briefing o'connor talked about how the white house wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. in another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ssf derivative @ larc, modular buildup with bus-1 @ msfc, and single launch core ["wingless orbiter"] @ jsc. later, in response to a reporters question, i thought i heard o'connor say the option based on a ssf redesign was a "moderate" cost option, in between low & high cost options. not the "high cost" option as sawyer wrote). the article goes on to describe the other two options as "one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the russian mir. the other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like skylab. that option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure." the last sentence in the article contradicts the title & the first paragraph. the sentence reads "he [o'connor] said a streamlined version of the planned space station freedom is still possible within the administration's budget guidelines."
the following press release was distributed april 1 by nasa headquarters. space station redesign advisory members named along with dr. charles m. vest, recently named by vice president albert gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station, nasa has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by nasa. "i am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. america's future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care," said vest. "we have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, i believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task." the advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by nasa's redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. space station international partners also are being asked to participate and will be named at a later date. the advisory committee will submit its recommendations in june. advisory committee members named today include: dr. charles vest dr. bobby alford president, mit executive vp & dean of medicine baylor college of medicine mr. jay chabrow dr. paul chu president, jmr associates director, texas center for superconductivity university of houston dr. ed crawley dr. john fabian prof of aero & astro president & ceo mit anser maj. gen. james fain dr. edward fort deputy chief of staff for chancellor requirements; headquarters north carolina at&t usaf materials command state university dr. mary good mr. frederick hauck senior vp of technology president, international technical allied signal, inc. underwriters dr. lou lanzerotti mr. william lilly chair, space sciences national academy of public board, national research administration council mr. duane mcruer dr. brad parkinson president systems technology prof of astro & aero stanford university dr. robert seamans dr. lee silver former nasa deputy admin. w.m. keck foundation professor for resource geology california institute of technology dr. albert "bud" wheelon retired ceo hughes aircraft

in the april edition of "one small step for a space activist", allen sherzer & tim kyger write: "another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes the 'center tax'). when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center, the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund. this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund. this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated. think about that: of the $30 billion cost of freedom, fully $10 billion won't be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations! now, maybe that $10 billion was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting the cost of other projects. congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps; congress has never heard the term 'center tax'. they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn't add up. they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else." my dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. a couple of weeks ago, when i first read this in your posting, i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters [if you wondering why i didn't post a response immediately, i do have a real job i'm supposed to be doing here at headquarters, & digging up old 20 khz data & looking into sherzer/kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. also, i spent last weekend in kansas city, at the national science teachers association conference, extolling the virtues of ssf to 15,000 science teachers.] first off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. if i recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around $40 million. this was computed by adding up the wp-1, wp-2, and wp-4 center 'taxes'. with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8% over the life of the ssf program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of ssf, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. this is alot less than $10 billion, but i will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change. i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like mcdonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). for example, at wp-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract, and are *not* subject to the center tax (i don't have the numbers in front of me, but i'd guess at least 95% of the wp-4 funds go to rocketdyne). so, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts. this leads to the obvious question "what is the government doing with ssf funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, wp-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne. what happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)" at wp-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne). we have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the nickel-hydrogen batteries on ssf), dc switchgear, dc-dc converter units, and simulated loads. data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system. we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana. as a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year). as a final example, my 'home' division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a monte-carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements). finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' at lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. each year, any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter. most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the center, like the library, the central computer services division, the contractor who removes the snow, etc. thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn't go for ssf activities. to get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year is 'billable' to ssf, would you base it on the person-hours ssf employees spend reading av-week versus the rest of the center personnel). you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. who knows, maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? talk about a burecratic nightmare! my last point is that i can't believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.' unfortunately, all of the nasa testimony before congress isn't on a computer, so i can't do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong. but surely, in some gao audit somewhere, these nasa cost methods were documented for congress?
mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc-x huntington beach, calif. -- on a picture-perfect southern california day, mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc-x rocket ship last saturday. the company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (ssto) rocket ship. the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week. flight tests will start in mid-june. although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy. the sdi organization -- which paid $60 million for the dc-x -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle. to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital dc-xa, sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies. sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns. however, recent changes in sdi's political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority. today, the agency is more interested in using dc-x as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket. sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said col. simon "pete" worden, sdio's deputy for technology. but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. "i didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters. while sdio has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the dc-x as an example of the "better, faster, cheaper" approach to hardware development. the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of evolutionary technology developments. worden said the dc-x illustrates how a "build a little, test a little" approach can produce results on time and within budget. he said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our parents' time." "the key is management," worden said. "sdio had a very light hand on this project. we had only one overworked major, jess sponable." although the next phase may involve more agencies, worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. "it's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially." sdio's approach also won praise from two california members of the house science, space and technology committee. "this is the direction we're going to have to go," said rep. george brown, the committee's democratic chairman. "programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....nasa hasn't learned it yet. sdio has." rep. dana rohrbacher, brown's republican colleague, went further. joking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team," rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency. rohrbacher, whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas, also criticized nasa-air force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top. let's build a spaceship!" although rohrbacher praised sdio's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology. mcdonnell douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its c-17 transport and space station freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. "on very large ventures, companies put in seed money," said charles ordahl, mcdonnell douglas' senior vice president for space systems. "you need strong government investments." while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc-xa, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development. citing corporate history, they liken the process to douglas aircraft's dc aircraft. just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper (dc-1). flight tests this summer at white sands will "expand the envelope" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude. the first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing. the second series will send the unmanned dc-x up to 5,000 feet. the third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet. maneuvers will become more complex on third phase. the final tests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing. the flight test series will be supervised by charles "pete" conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing. now a mcdonnell douglas vice president, conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations. features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance. if the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration. this engine would have more thrust than the pratt & whitney rl10a-5 engines used on the dc-x. each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages, the a-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability. it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround. worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union. the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes. the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place. pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash, the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and energia cryogenic engines.

"yeah, i took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it." "so what if i stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first." besides that, i think it's still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it. so your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway. your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool: "i never borrowed it, i already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me." make up yer mind, fred! >>>>i'm not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space- >>>>based process, and your response doesn't tell me a thing about the >>>>reasons why you think they should be, except to impune the motives of >>>>the person with a divergent opinion. >>>who said i think they should be, tommy?

or are you going to eat your terminal now? if the latter, i sure hope it's one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-) the point is, _i_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption. i'd only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it. but, alas, that's your job, fred. and, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult. sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone. >more deliberate lack of understanding, tommy?

if you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which i was on for about 2 years. if you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior. it's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own. let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't. yeah, right. maybe if you called me some more names, i might see it better, fred. "net.ghod wannabe"? naturally, fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves). i didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what i really wanted was to impress everyone. i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because i thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the net, playing right into my hands. alas, i had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me. whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear. well, fred, you exposed me. now i'll never be able to get a(nother) job with nasa, since they all know that i'm stupider than fred mccall. well, i just hope you're happy. please leave me alone, now. i just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me. maybe nick or pat can approach your high standards, but i'm dropping it now. -tommy mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- tom mcwilliams 517-355-2178 wk \\ as the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows. -------------------------------------------------------------------------

there has been something bothering me while watching nasa select for a while. well, i should'nt say bothering, maybe wondering would be better. when they are going to launch they say (sorry but i forget exactly who is saying what, otc to plt i think) "clear caution & warning memory. verify no unexpected errors. ...". i am wondering what an "expected error" might be. sorry if this is a really dumb question, but inquiring minds just gotta know............ yeah, yeah, i know, its those dumb cosmospheres again! ============================================================= randy padgett, supervisor bitnet : etrat@ttacs academic computing facilities internet : etrat@ttacs.ttu.edu texas tech university thenet : ttacs::etrat lubbock, tx 79409-42042 (806) 742-3653 fax (806) 742-1755

hi all, i really thought that by now i would have seen something about this, but i haven't, so here goes: last night on the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of some sort rattling around apparently inside the case. there was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson did say something about a nasa official commenting that there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the ssrb. has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be better than mine heard anything about this? it seems rather weird. mitch ---------------------------->jmcocker@eos.ncsu.edu

forwarded from neal ausman, galileo mission director galileo mission director status report post-launch april 9 - 15, 1993 spacecraft 1. on april 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the low gain antenna (lga-2) swing/dual drive actuator (dda) hammer activities. 2. on april 9, the ej-1 (earth-jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident. this sequence covers spacecraft activity from april 12, 1993 to june 14, 1993 and includes a window for the radio relay antenna (rra) slew test on april 28, 1993. the command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load. 3. on april 12 and 15, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase. 4. on april 12, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer (mag) instruments. preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly. 5. on april 12, an ultra-stable oscillator (uso) test was performed to verify the health status of the uso and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing. 6. on april 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (snr) when transmitting at 40bps. preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level. 7. on april 15, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv) and magnetometer (mag) instrument. preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly. 8. on april 15, a periodic rpm (retro-propulsion module) 10-newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity. thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal. 9. the ac/dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period. the ac measurement reads 19 dn (4.3 volts). the dc measurement reads 111 dn (12.9 volts). these measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac/dc special anomaly team. 10. the spacecraft status as of april 15, 1993, is as follows: a) system power margin - 60 watts b) spin configuration - dual-spin c) spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner d) spacecraft attitude is approximately 18 degrees off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading) e) downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1 f) general thermal control - all temperatures within acceptable range g) rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range h) orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws, euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds i) probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within acceptable range j) cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours time to initiation - 260 hours gds (ground data systems): 1. galileo participated in a second dsn (deep space network) acceptance test for the dsn telemetry phase 3 upgrade on april 13, 1993, using cta-21 (compatibility test area 21). the purpose of this test was to verify the flow of galileo telemetry data through the new telemetry group controller (tgc) and the telemetry channel assembly (tca). the tgc/tca is the replacement for the current telemetry processing assembly (tpa). seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the mts (mccc telemetry subsystem) and the ammos mgds v18.0 gif with the exception of 10bps. the 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the tgc/tca was not metering the data correctly. further comparisons between the mgds and mts data from this test are being conducted. mvt (mission verification test) of the tgc/tca system is expected to begin may 16, 1993. trajectory as of noon thursday, april 15, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory status was as follows: 	distance from earth 152,606,000 km (1.02 au) 	distance from sun 277,519,800 km (1.86 au) 	heliocentric speed 93,400 km per hour 	distance from jupiter 543,973,900 km 	round trip light time 17 minutes, 4 seconds special topic 1. as of april 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted to galileo since launch. of these, 65076 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. in the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process. major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference, uplink the ej-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | being cynical never helps /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | and causes more aggravation | instead.
forwarded from: public information office jet propulsion laboratory california institute of technology national aeronautics and space administration pasadena, calif. 91109. (818) 354-5011 contact: mary a. hardin for immediate release april 15, 1993 #1506 scientists at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the earth's ozone layer. the april 3 flight from california's barstow/daggett airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars). the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy (atmos) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle discovery. "we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program. in fact, jpl is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways," said dr. jim margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign. "there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite," he continued. "the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists, and the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right." the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions. the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl instruments: an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight. launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots). data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard. the flight ended at 10 p.m. pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon. "we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements," margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear." it will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments. they will then forward their data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt, maryland for use by the uars scientists. the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon facility, normally based in palestine, tex., operating under a contract from nasa's wallops flight facility. the balloon was launched in california because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest. the balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter). the balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds). the scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high. the jpl balloon research is sponsored by nasa's upper atmosphere research program and the uars correlative measurements program. ##### ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | being cynical never helps /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | and causes more aggravation | instead.

i was reading popular science this morning and was surprised by an ad in the back. i know that a lot of the ads in the back of ps are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. it was from a company name "personal missle, inc." or something like that. anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length and engines of sizes "f" to "m". they also said that some rockets will reach 50,000 feet. now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts, isn't this illegal? i can't imagine the faa allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down. and no, i'm not going to even think of buying one. i'm not that crazy. -paul "mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite" dokas -- #include <std.disclaimer> #define full_name "paul dokas" #define email "pbd@runyon.cim.cdc.com" /* just remember, you *will* die someday. */

let's see. these aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. that term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. the rockets you describe are called hpr, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. they use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. the engines are classified by impulse. a "d" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. an "f" engine can have no more than 40 ns. each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. so far, engines up to size "o" are available pretty much off the shelf. engines of size h and above are shipped as class b explosives, and as such are controlled. engines of size f and below are shipped as class c explosives, and are not as controlled. class f engines, btw, are not hpr engines, but model rocket engines. (class g engines go in and out of legal limbo.) there is an hpr society, the tripoli rocket society, i believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (faa waiver included) taken care of. the national association of rocketry is more concerned with engines below h, though it is involved in hpr as well. these societies certify users of hpr rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals. bottom line: it's legit. i suggest you send for a catalog - but forget the dynamite, will ya? -larry c.

actually, they are legal! i not familiar with the ad you are speaking of but knowing popular science it is probably on the fringe. however, you may be speaking of "public missle, inc.", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while. due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to srb fuel, roughly 3 times more powerful than black powder motors. they are even available in a reloadable form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!). the engines range from d all the way to m in common manufacture, n and o i've heard of used at special occasions. to be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal structural parts, amongst other requirements. i've never heard of a model rocket doing 50,000. i have heard of > 20,000 foot flights. these require faa waivers (of course!). there are a few large national launches (ldrs, fireballs), at which you can see many > k sized engine flights. actually, using a > g engine constitutes the area of "high power rocketry", which is seperate from normal model rocketry. purchase of engines like i have been describing require membership in the national association of rocketry, the tripoli rocketry assoc., or you have to be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry. amatuer rocketry is another area. i'm not really familiar with this, but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuels and what not. i don't know what kind of regulations are involved, but i'm sure they are numerous. high power rocketry is very exciting! if you are interested or have more questions, there is a newsgroup rec.model.rockets.

from another space forum > now where did i leave those pliers? when workers at the kennedy space center disassembled the sts-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand srb. the tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to ksc. nasa spokesperson lisa malone told the media, "it's been a long time since something like this happened. we've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this." the initial investigation into the incident has shown that a thiokol corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on april 2nd. unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and discovery was launched with its "extra payload". nasa officials were never told of the missing tool before the april 8th launch date. the free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the srb technician. when the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached. the pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad. |(ron's ed. note: naaahhh, just too easy) a spokesperson for the lockheed space operations company said that the shuttle processor will take "appropriate action". thiokol is a subcontractor to lsoc for work to prepare shuttle hardware for launch. _________________________________________________________ karl anderson	 dev/2000: configuration management/version control dept 53k/006-2		rochester, minnesota 55901 253-8044		tie 8-453-8044 internet: karl@vnet.ibm.com prodigy: cmmg96a "to seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield." 			alfred lord tennyson

reported yesterday in the washington post (kathy sawyer, writer): the article plays down the russian role in us space. gibbons (science advisor to clinton) sent goldin a letter indicating nasa should not limit redesign options to those compatible with mir orbit. the white house thinks expectations for russian cooperation have been raised too high. the article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible. that's why some think goldin has begun looking at russian hardware. goldin states nasa will present all options to the administration which will then have decision making power. goldin and the white house have totally ruled out using energia to boost the station. -- chuck divine

background: the orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept. it would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. the idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main spacecraft. the shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship. now, in an atmosphere i can see this. the energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate. but in a vacuum, only two things i can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products). would this work? i can't see the em radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there. i must be missing something. would someone enlighten me via email? thanks. -- 	--jim --- jim goltz alternet engineer goltz@uunet.uu.net

> there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit is it right??? that is new stuff for me. so it means that you just can not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because its orbit will be unstable??? if so, what is the reason??? is that because the combined gravitacional atraction of the sun,moon and earth that does not provide a stable orbit around the moon??? c.o.egalon@larc.nasa.gov c.o.egalon@larc.nasa.gov claudio oliveira egalon

i have attached a copy of an announcement i picked up during my trip to moscow last week. i have several friends at the moscow aviation institute who have asked me to post this announcement. (i have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.) for those of you not familiar with the moscow aviation institute, it is the leading russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers. it specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. virtually all of the major former soviet airframe designers (tupolev, su, iluchine, migoyan, etc.) were schooled at mai. i had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at mai. the aircraft include mig23, su 27, yak 38, the cockpit of an f-111(!), among others. it was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone. i also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use. if you have any questions about the institute, or the program, i would be glad to try and answer them. the institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses. however, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message. they are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing! steve emmett semmett@gmuvax2.gmu.edu ps please send any questions you have for me via e-mail. george mason university has about a 2 week (!) delay in news feed delivery. ------------------------------------------------------------------- 		moscow international aviation school the aviation school "poljot" (meaning flight) is organized by the the moscow aviation institute, the prominent russian center of airspace education and the foreign trade firm poljot, well known in various parts of the world for their quartz and mechanical wrist watches. the course of studies will last only 50 days, but during this time you will have the unique opportunity: 	- to listen to intensive courses on the main aviation disciplines, the history and theory of techniques, and design of airplanes; 	- to visit and get acquainted with the world known russian aviation firms - tu, mig, yak, il and su; 	- to meet and have discussions with famous aviation scientists, engineers and pilots; 	- to visit the most interesting museums of unique aviation techniques which were closed for many years to the public; 	- to see the international airspace show which will take place in moscow from 31 august through 3 september 1993; 	- to visit famous art museums, historical and architectural monuments, theatres and concert halls; 	- to take part in sport competitions and have a great time with new friends. the director of the school is mr. oleg samelovich, a well known russian scientist, professor, general designer and the chief of the airplanes design department of the moscow aviation institute. mr. samelovich is one of the designers of the the su-24, su-25, and su-27 the lectures are given in english, using a multi-media concept. the students are provided with all the necessary text books and literature. after the full course of studies are completed, the student will receive a special certificate of graduation. the cost of studies, including hotel, meals, excursions, theatres, etc is $3500. to apply for admission, send your application to: 109147 moscow marksistskaja 34 foreign trade firm "poljot" 274 00 13 (phone) 274 00 22 (fax) 411989 polex su (telex) in your application, include your full name, address, date and place of birth. in addition, include complete passport information, as well as a description of your education. upon receipt of this information, "poljot" will immediately forward to you an official invitation for obtaining a russian entrance visa as well as details on payment. should you require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads. thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations. solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix. for example, the space shuttle srbs are 16 percent aluminum. the technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an i suspect some bubbling process is used to form it). in other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get. it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions. the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant. the foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain. the major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant. dani eder -- dani eder/meridian investment company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/ rt.1, box 188-2, athens al 35611/location: 34deg 37' n 86deg 43' w +100m alt.
okay, lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun. the project manager is dr. john hunter, and he works for the laser group at livermore. what, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the free electron laser building, and the fel building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled. so i suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience. i visited hunter at the beginning of feb. and we toured the gun. at the time i was working on gas gun r&d at boeing, where i work, but i am now doing other things (helping to save the space station), the gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch id (i.e. it looks like a pipe). the chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber. on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres. the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. the barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore. it is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect). this was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber. the projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long. all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel. the barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than saran wrap). the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile. the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs. in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found. at the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes. the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range. the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the pacific ocean, and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles. the design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed). so far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (i think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but i haven't had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this). there are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach 8. this gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space. this would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit. dani eder -- dani eder/meridian investment company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/ rt.1, box 188-2, athens al 35611/location: 34deg 37' n 86deg 43' w +100m alt.
reading from a amoco performance products data sheet, their erl-1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi. it has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 statute miles. now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength. this gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column. a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up. for example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation). this requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight. the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase. the next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload. each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom. we can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support. let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost. with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb. the $40/lb figure is just for materials cost. then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1. at a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles. this is clearly above the significant atmosphere. a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated. g-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity. thus they represent wasted thrust. together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with. this analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads. these will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height. above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor. dani eder -- dani eder/meridian investment company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/ rt.1, box 188-2, athens al 35611/location: 34deg 37' n 86deg 43' w +100m alt.
there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's la times (thursday april 15, 1993, p. d1). i thought i'd post it to stir up some flame wars - i mean reasoned debate. let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the "space age" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time. reading, for example, "what's new" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which i include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days. to a large extent, i think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia. i feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind children" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but i think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*. anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all... space age glory fades from view micheal schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at mit) at 35, america's space age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis. the reason is that the space age is already dead. the technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards. space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue. speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy. to be sure, america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead. ..... before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age. the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station freedom alone. even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures. the reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much. political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets. indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as voyager, the post-apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more. ...... while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america's technological prowess. the space station budget has - rightly - been slashed. space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda. ...... "i wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now," says bruce murray, a caltech professor who ran nasa's jet propulsion lab in pasadena. "we've put off a lot of things we shouldn't have.... i would rather see a $10-billion nasa doing well than a $40-billion one filled with white elephants."

the difficulties of a high isp otv include: long transfer times (radiation damage from vanallen belts for both the spacecraft and otv arcjets or xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of radiation damage) or big solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy) that make attitude control and docking a big pain. if you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with current technology. nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty. refueling (even for very high isp like xenon) is still required and] turn out to be a pain. you either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or ( and refueling) . you still can't do much plane change because the deltav required is so high! the air force continues to look at doing things this way though. i suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved. not impossible in principle, but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today. just a few random thoughts on high isp otv's. i designed one once... steve collins

we are not at the end of the space age, but only at the end of its beginning. that space exploration is no longer a driver for technical innovation, or a focus of american cultural attention is certainly debatable; however, technical developments in other quarters will always be examined for possible applications in the space area and we can look forward to many innovations that might enhance the capabilities and lower the cost of future space operations. the dream is alive and well. -jeff bytof member, technical staff institute for remote exploration
this is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for', and i ought not to post when i've a hundred some odd posts to go, but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic. since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger gnp than they would _without_ space industry, eventually, they will simply be able to afford more stuff. graydon

oddly, enough, the smithsonian calls the lindbergh years the golden age of flight. i would call it the granite years, reflecting the primitive nature of it. it was romantic, swashbuckling daredevils, "those daring young men in their flying machines". but in reality, it sucked. death was a highly likely occurence, and the environment blew. ever see the early navy pressure suits, they were modified diving suits. you were ready to star in "plan 9 from outer space". radios and nav aids were a joke, and engines ran on castor oil. they picked and called aviators "men with iron stomachs", and it wasn't due to vertigo. oddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight. i can hop the shuttle to ny for $90 bucks, now that's golden. mercury gemini, and apollo were romantic, but let's be honest. peeing in bags, having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime you needed a bowel movement. living for days inside a vw bug. romantic, but not commercial. the dc-x points out a most likely new golden age. an age where fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls and used space ship lots. hhhmmmmm, maybe i'll retract that golden age bit. maybe it was better in the old days. of course, then we'll have wally schirra telling his great grand children, "in my day, we walked on the moon. every day. miles. no buses. you kids got it soft". pat

i might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking the very leading question (in two or three parts) what are your long term expectations of space market, what projects specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels and what competition do you expect in this area.

i doubt there are good prospects for a self armoring system for venus surface conditions (several hundred degrees, very high pressure of co2, possibly sulfuric and nitric acids or oxides but it is a notion to consider for outer planets rs where you might pick up ices under less extream upper atmosphere conditions buying deeper penetration. a nice creative idea, unlikly but worthy of thinking about.

i found it very interesting that atlas depended on pressure to maintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any of the ssto concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the launch configuration would be significantly different from the reentry one? i have long been facinated by pnumatic structures as conceived and built by frei otto and others, a "ballon" tank ssto sounds very clever.

the sdio has "contracted" with the nrl (naval research laboratory) to fly the clementine mission. btw we call it dspse (deep space project science experiment). the nrl is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from, jpl & goddard & prob. some folks i have left out...don't be mad). i am on the tamp (trajectory analysis & mission planning) team and am responsable for the iv&v of the traj that goddard/csc are designing. as for why sdio is doing it, some of the reasons are: 1) the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the lidar in leo 2) in leo we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get that data on our 9 passages through the van allen (sp?) belts 3) since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science 4) the intercept problem is a lot easied over long distances and long times i am sure there are some things i have forgotten, and some i haven't been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about. -- jim blackshear jib@bonnie.jsc.nasa.gov

posted to the internet by wmiler@nyx.cs.du.edu 000062david42 041493003715 the lunar tele-operation model one (ltm1) ========================================= by david h. mitchell march 23, 1993 introduction: in order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. these models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for edutainment purposes. not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in twenty-first century remote learning methods. because of the nature of the ltm1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. in operation ltm1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the ltm1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves. this has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us ltm1 overall design: a room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. the walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. the "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets. the ltm1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. a moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface. each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on it. a personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals. the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm1. next, an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land. finally, some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets. the entire initial ltm1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers. by taking a graphically oriented communications program (dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours. plan of action: the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network. diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip. diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock" for the lunar train model. diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. an initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on april 30, 1993. the initial models will be put in place. a time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony. a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. field trips to ltm1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus. a monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. especially since the "action" will be controlled by people all over the world. science fiction writers will be invited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges. the long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. ltm1 has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment. all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars! conclusion: edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment. anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. by creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space. moonlighters: "illuminating the

if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place. there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen, but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you? it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. lack of leadership from the white house, congress and at reston. nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this. >>why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally >>demanded change that caused the problems?

every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic booms. having taken various relevant classes, i have several ideas of where they come from, but none of them are very convincing. exactly what causes them? are they a one time pheneomenon, or a constant one like the supersonic shockwave that is constantly produced by a plane, but you hear only when it goes over you? --- --------------------------------------------------------------------- | carlos g. niederstrasser | only two things are infinite, | | princeton planetary society | the universe and human | | | stupidity, and i'm not sure | | | about the former. - einstein | | carlosn@phoenix.princeton.edu |---------------------------------| | space@phoenix.princeton.edu | ad astra per ardua nostra | ---------------------------------------------------------------------

hi, i'm writing a science fiction script and i'm looking for some answers to questions regarding the moon and earth. my starting point is an impossible situation. [i checked with a professor at berkeley and his response was a very helpful "can't happen".] if you enjoy playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions please contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com). i get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic facts about computers that i'm determined to be as scientifically accurate as i can. sorry for being vague, but i'd like to protect my idea as much as i can until i'm ready to sell it (hopefully). jennise
sorry but i forgot this ps. right now my sight is getting news about two weeks behind so it's kind of necessary (to me) that any responses be sent to me directly. thanks a lot jennise jennise@dgi.com
arianespace flight 56 (flight v.56 was originally intended to carry the hughes hs-601 series galaxy iv satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.) the 56th ariane launch is now scheduled to place the astra 1c and arsene satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (gto), with inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km. this will be the 28th launch of an ariane 4 and the first in the 42l configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (pal). it will be launched from the newly refurbished ariane launch complex ela 2, in kourou - french guiana. the launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass. the total vehicle mass at liftoff is 361,778 kg. required orbit characteristics: perigee altitude ..... 200 km apogee altitude ...... 36,160 km at injection inclination .......... 5 degrees the ariane 42l lift-off for flight 56 is scheduled on thursday, april 29, 1993, as soon as possible within the following launch window: kourou time gmt (04/30/93) washington, dc 21:52 - 22:50 00:52 - 01:50 20:52 - 21:50 launch vehicle: ariane 42l. this is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid fueled strap-on boosters. the first stage (l220) is built by aerospatiale, and is powered by 4 liquid fueled viking v engines. the second stage (l33) is built by mbb erno and is powered by a single viking iv engine. both the viking iv and v engines are manufactured by sep. the first and second stages use a biliquid uh25/n2o4 fuel. the third stage (h10) is built by aerospatiale, and is powered by a cryogenic h2/o2 fueled hm-7b engine built by sep. the two strap-on boosters (pal) are each powered by a viking vi engine, also built by sep, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages. the fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad. it uses the type 01 ariane short payload fairing. flight profile: +02:21 liquid strap-on booster jettison +03:11 first stage separation +03:18 second stage ignition +04:10 fairing jettison +05:21 second stage separation +05:26 third stage ignition +17:30 third stage shutdown / orbit injection +19:56 astra 1c separation +22:36 cyclade adapter separation +24:26 arsene separation +28:47 end of ariane mission 56 payloads: astra 1c is the third spacecraft in the fleet of "societe europeenne des satellites" to broadcast direct tv to homes all over europe. built by hughes, it will be the second hs-601 launched by ariane. total mass at lift-off .... 2,790 kg mass at geo insertion ..... 1,700 kg dry mass .................. 1,180 kg on-board power ............ 3,300 w (end of life) nominal lifetime .......... 15 years span of solar panels ...... 21 m on-orbit position ......... 19.2 degrees east, over africa. transmission capacity: 34 channels in ku-band, via 18 transponders. in-flight operations: solar array deployment ............ about 6 days after lift-off first of 3 apogee motor firings ... about 40 hours after lift-off at 4th apogee arsene is the first spacecraft built by the european space industry for the benefit of the world amateur radio community. total mass at lift-off .... 154 kg mass at geo insertion ..... 98 kg dry mass .................. 97 kg on-board power ............ 42 w (end of life) nominal lifetime .......... 3 years spacecraft dimensions ..... 1.1m x .96m orbital parameters ........ 20000/36000 km, 0 inclination, period 17:30. transmission capacity: s-band: 1 transponder at 2.446 ghz vhf/uhf: 145/435 mhz launch coverage: all ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from kourou. coverage begins at 30 minutes before launch and continues until all payloads have been deployed. this mission will likely be carried in the us on galaxy 6, however it could be galaxy 7 or another satellite.

i think if there is to be a prize and such.. there should be "classes" such as the following: large corp. small corp/company (based on reported earnings?) large government (gnp and such) small governemtn (or political clout or gnp?) large organization (planetary society? and such?) small organization (alot of small orgs..) the organization things would probably have to be non-profit or liek ?? of course this means the prize might go up. larger get more or ?? basically make the prize (total purse) $6 billion, divided amngst the class winners.. more fair? there would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events, umpire and such and watch for safety violations (or maybe not, if peopel want to risk thier own lives let them do it?). any other ideas?? == michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i'm not high, just jacked

joint press release esa/un no 18-93 paris, 19 april 1993 un/esa joint training course on satellite applications to be held in italy, 19-30 april the united nations and the european space agency (esa) are jointly organising a training course on the applications of satellite data gathered by the european remote sensing satellite (ers-1), to be held in frascati, italy, from 19 to 30 april. the training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment. the training course, organised for the benefit of francophone african experts, will be hosted by esrin, the european space agency's establishment in frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from esa's remote sensing satellite. twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central africa, and three regional african centres, will attend the two-week session. the course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ers-1 data. the ers-1 satellite, developed by esa and launched in 1991 with the european ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. the aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology. the education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the united nations and esa. the facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the agency. lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other european and african organisations active in remote sensing applications. funds for the training course are being provided by the united nations trust fund for new and renewable sources of energy; the primary contributor to that fund is the government of italy. a similar training course is being planned for latin american experts.

why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. for example, why couldn't magellan just be told to go into a "safe" mode and stay bobbing about venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again. for that matter, why exactly were the apollo lunar experiments "turned off" rather than just "safed". was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)? turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair.... i've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled" spacecraft causes "radio noise." i find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode. this safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on earth. at that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue. if no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. as we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact earth, we could be prepared if necessary. as another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards earth. if someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. by making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft. i see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (jupiter/saturn orbit, exiting the solar system, etc). perhaps those designing future spacecraft (cassini, pluto flyby, etc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. perhaps mars observer and galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission "drift" phase. so any holes in all this? /~~~(-: james t. green :-)~~~~(-: jgreen@oboe.calpoly.edu :-)~~~\ | "i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving	| | the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the 	| | moon and returning him safely to the earth." 		| | <john f. kennedy; may 25, 1961> 		|

all of this talk about a commercial space race (i.e. $1g to the first 1-year moon base) is intriguing. similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. the $25k orteig prize helped lindbergh sell his spirit of saint louis venture to his financial backers. if memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as fokker's, nungesser and other multi-engine projects). however lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount. but i strongly suspect that his saint louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than $25,000. could it work with the moon? who are the far-sighted financial backers of today? layne cook cook@apt.mdc.com mcdonnell douglas space systems co.

forwarded from john spencer (spencer@lowell.edu): there will be two eclipses of iapetus by saturn and its rings, in may and july. please spread the word! here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from jay goguen of jpl appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of iapetus. he might also have some money available... john spencer, 1993/04/21 iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of saturn's rings and saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 ut) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 ut). timing is as follows; 1993 may 1-2 a-ring ingress 18:27 egress 19:30 b-ring ingress 19:51 egress 21:42 c-ring egress 23:00 saturn ingress 23:59 egress 10:02 b-ring ingress 10:28 egress 12:19 a-ring ingress 12:40 egress 13:43 1993 july 20-21 saturn ingress 21:16 egress 05:08 a-ring ingress 05:13 (grazing) egress 09:38 times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining iapetus' orbit. because the sun's size projected on the rings as seen from iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations. see soma (1992), astronomy and astrophysics 265, l21-l24 for more details. thanks to andy odell of northern arizona university for bringing the events to my attention. thermal observations? jay goguen (jdg@scn5.jpl.nasa.gov) writes: to me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal ir of the 20 july disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia, etc. unfortunately, the 21:30 ut of this event renders it inaccessible, except from russia. even from calar alto, saturn is rising through 3 airmasses at 23:00 ut. do you know anyone in russia or ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something to do? i'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data. jay and again: please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths. my impression would be that it's not an easy observation. iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a good ir telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation. i don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for observation. we need sofia for this one. one possibility would be the ir telescope in india, but it's only a 1.2 m. jay ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.
some time ago i sent the following message: every once in a while i design an orbital space colony. i'm gearing up to do another one. i'd some info from you. if you were to move onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable? specifically, how many people do you want to share the colony with? what physical dimensions does the living are need to have? assume 1g living (the colony will rotate). assume that you can leave from time to time for vacations and business trips. if you're young enough, assume that you'll raise your children there. i didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block. thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought. here's the (edited) responses i got: how many people do you want to share the colony with? 100 what physical dimensions does the living are need to have? cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long rui sousa ruca@saber-si.pt ============================================================================= > how many people do you want to share the colony with? 100,000 - 250,000 > what physical dimensions does the living are need to have? 100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and countryside. must have lakes, rivers amd mountains. ============================================================================= > how many 1000. 1000 people really isn't that large a number; everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably be sick of everyone else within another year. >what physical dimensions does the living are need to have? hm. i am not all that great at figuring it out. but i would maximize the percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans. esecially if there were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways. and everyone, especially me, likes to "go exploring"...i would want to be able to go for a walk and see something different each time... ============================================================================= for population, i think i would want a substantial town -- big enough to have strangers in it. this helps get away from the small-town "everybody knows everything" syndrome, which some people like but i don't. call it several thousand people. for physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion: big enough to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time getting to know it. as a more specific rule of thumb, big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on foot. call that 5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere. henry spencer at u of toronto zoology henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo!henry ============================================================================= my desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication and travel: size: about a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.

i have a nice quote that i like (or as close as i can remember it). if i say something that you think is crazy, ask me what i mean before you think its crazy.. so some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was wilbur and orville wright, and quite a few others.. sorry if i do not have the big degrees and such, but i think (i might be wrong, to error is human) i have something that is in many ways just as important, i have imagination, dreams. and without dreams all the knowledge is worthless.. sorry my two cents worth. or is it two rubles worth? the basic quote idea is from h. beam pipers book "space vikings". its a good book on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights. unfortunately h. beam piper killed him self just weeks short of having his first book published, and have his ideas see light.. such a waste.

hi, i was reading through "the spaceflight handbook" and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. the magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. he also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. all this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. if these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? can this be extended to larger accelerations? thanks is advance... -amruth laxman
here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration. basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. you think this is crazy. well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality. there is a billin the congress to do just that.. basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the us, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what i understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. so by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. basically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. and the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco-freaks or the protectionist.. such fun we have in these interesting times.. == michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i'm not high, just jacked
ssrt rollout speech delivered by col. simon p. worden, the deputy for technology, sdio mcdonnell douglas - huntington beach april 3,1993 most of you, as am i, are "children of the 1960's." we grew up in an age of miracles -- inter-continental ballistic missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon. but these were miracles of our parent's doing. for a decade and more the pundits have told us - "you've lost it!" the "me" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past. you and i have even begun to believe the pessimists. we listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs. living history they are. we are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it. a few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as general bernie schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation's intercontinental ballistic missile. what stories can we tell? blurry-eyed telescopes? thousand dollar toilet seats? even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time. they are and seem destined to remain gen. schriever's icbms. i find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old minuteman and poseidon ballistic missiles. well - the pessimists are wrong. the legacy is continuing. this event is proof. to our technological parents: we've listened to your stories. we've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. and we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes. let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - max hunter. you are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration. your insight and discipline built the thor icbm - later incorporated into today's most successful launch vehicle - the delta. you told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built. you advocated this idea tirelessly. it was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs. you showed us how to build it. you convinced us it could be done. you are working by our side to weld its components into place. most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little and max, you passed all of this on to people like pat ladner who started this program for the sdi. douglas aircraft didn't start with a dc-10. they didn't even start with a dc-3. our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step. they didn't take a decade or more before putting the first "rubber on the road." max hunter - you didn't take ten years to build thor, and by god we're not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real. we ended the cold war in a few short years. it took the same team here today but a few years to show through the strategic defense initiative that the cold war must end. we - you and us - launched a series of satellites - the delta experiments - in about a year apiece. this, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet union. those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship. but it is the same team which is now putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation. we will make space access routine and affordable. we built this magnificent flying machine in two years. this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time. then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket. it will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can. and yes - we'll make a little money off it too! then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system. the dc-3 of space will be a reality! we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. what a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian efforts to counter sdi merge to power mankind's next step to the stars! to be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer. robert goddard's first rockets weren't saturn v's! if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail. max hunter and his colleagues showed the way. three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts. there is no short-cut. if we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time. minds on tasks at hand! this project is real. the torch of american technological greatness is being passed. we are americans. this machine is american. let's go fly it!
speech by pete worden delivered before the u.s. space foundation conference colorado springs, colorado april 15, 1993 what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble. for providing me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the u.s. space foundation. my topic today is the single stage rocket technology rocket or ssrt. by i intend to speak of more. how to lower the cost and make rapid progress. ssrt is to my mind -- and i hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- faster, cheaper, and better. faster, cheaper, better and ssrt represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another. it is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters. when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense. for example, dr. eberhart rachtin - former president of the aerospace corp., said of ssrt in the l.a. times that it, "defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." well dr. rachtin -- you've made us mad! what are these principles that ssrt defies? well i'll tell you. it violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware. it violates the "fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new. and it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars. it took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons. werhner von braun's first rocket was not a saturn v. general schriever's icbm's didn't take ten years to demonstrate. and the x-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion. it took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- max hunter. max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the thor irbm program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story. max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - build a little, test a little. next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration. we didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway. [ not included in the speech -- the als/nls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as "shape shifter" than "space lifter." we didn't spend a lot money -- this x-rocket only cost $60 million. when's the last time we even built a new airplane for that? and it didn't take a lot of time to build -- mcdonnell douglas completed it in 18 months. finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked air force major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule. as i described what ssrt is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step. there are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the u.s. can field an ssto. but each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget. let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve: (see charts) i'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's. they went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight. they soft-landed on mars - the least we could do is soft-land on earth! but we do have an answer. we can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space. i know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say ssrt is a stunt. it needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc. i say to you -- we'll see you at white sands in june. you bring your view-graphs, and i'll bring my rocketship. if we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step. [ not included in the speech: if we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.] i bet on my generation and max hunter's idea -- any takers?

well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative posting. the question i have about the proton, is could it be handled at one of ksc's spare pads, without major malfunction, or could it be handled at kourou or vandenberg? now if it uses storables, then how long would it take for the russians to equip something at cape york? if proton were launched from a western site, how would it compare to the t4/centaur? as i see it, it should lift very close to the t4. pat

ether implodes 2 earth core, is gravity!!! this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, and why we observe "orbital" motion!! ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the michelson-moreley experiment conducted a century ago. i propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind) the reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of biblical proportions through out the world!! remember: einstien said imagination is greater than knowledge!! 1 i dream like this: ether based reality the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = "dark matter") the earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset]) the moon isn't exactly orbiting us. it is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. the "orbit" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild. the earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" apart. its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the "path" is not the same. the moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. the sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at the end. the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. with a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as "earth's" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. look in the sky. except for your knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size? o . - - e o o o s e / \ m | | or m \ _ _ / s the full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. what we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( i've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. try and draw that "earth shadow.") its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. no matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us. "light-years" between galaxies is a misnomer. the distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) what we are seeing could be essentially happening now. the "piece" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time. to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within) to find out about all of this, i recommend studying history. i'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) brain waves just might carry decipherable data. i'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) i'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking dog backwards, and learn to read what i got. (microsoft holy grail card for pentium!) next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is i who move forward (in time). i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which i'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [why not?]) perhaps by passing a large, flat dc current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what i could get with my machine's receiver next to it. if you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: quit putting the reproductive keys of other life in your body! all of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. dna could be a little receiver or file access code. by eating seeds, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. try eating seed bearing fruit. maybe those greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. i'm curios to see what they did and ate. don't worry if your hair stops growing. (maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter! i only need enough to bounce around. where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die) warning about writing to the past: i had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. there were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. the dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by "advising" them in their past. basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. he said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. he carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. he enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. the amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. the universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. then some of the twelve were no more. finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. i made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind. moral: its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (golden rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) i.e., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) accepting rides to the past: once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a prince, or a queen, or you can live as a god in ancient greece. go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, adam henry. i hope you like inspecting your socks. careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser. as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. he can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. but he can't see the change. the basic nature of man is good. he had to apply his hand to achieve his world. as he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. how about public computer access to the i.r.s. ? its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, right? imagine this: washington marks the next cost at 8, irs collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. congress borrows 2. the banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. what do the banks do with it? hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. why? food production is 2% gnp?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto? the people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. have we been deceived? if we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? what if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? in that other reality, i shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" they said, "no, its order." he defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control. rain forest: the problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) these people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. also, they should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that i talk about. they can hear him. i think that ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. these people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds. famine relief: when i make my diet almost all whole wheat, i get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep a lot, and get sick. when i eat only fresh fruit, i get more energy, a hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep. un. peace keeping; there is fighting and killing all over. the troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its ok to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.) somalia: what is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. it is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. women with children, babes in arms: historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) i think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. there are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate. that guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. he tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) he'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. all it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. you have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of. i don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.

(delta clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.) any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way. given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project. -- all work is one man's work. | henry spencer @ u of toronto zoology - kipling | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo!henry

a related question (which i haven't given that much serious thought to): at what lattitude is the average length of the day (averaged over the whole year) maximized? is this function a constant= 12 hours? is it truly symmetric about the equator? or is there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic (or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and make the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter, but is far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight hours)? i want to know where to move. 	-nick firoozye 	nick@sfb256.iam.uni-bonn.de

besides this was the same line of horse puckey the mining companies claimed when they were told to pay for restoring land after strip mining. they still mine coal in the midwest, but now it doesn't look like the moon when theyare done. pat
i once read an article on computer technology which stated that every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced. silicon was less effective then the germanium products then available. gaas was less capable then silicon. multi-processors were slower then existent single processors. what the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance or lower cost or higher densities. i think that the dc-1 may g=fit into this same model. elv's can certainly launch more weight then a ssrt, but an ssrt offers the prospect of greater cycle times and lower costs. this is kind of a speculative posting, but i thought i'd throw it out as a hjistorical framework for those interested in the project. pat

press release no.19-93 paris, 22 april 1993 users of esa's olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments "today europe's space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had olympus not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s". this summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the conference on olympus utilisation held in seville on 20-22-april 1993. the conference was organised by the european space agency (esa) and the spanish centre for the development of industrial technology (cdti). olympus has been particularly useful : - in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small antennas (vsats). olympus experiments have tested data transmission, videoconferencing, business television, distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few examples. - in opening the door to new telecommunications services which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower- frequency bands; olympus was the first satellite over europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 ghz band. - in establishing two-way data relay links olympus received for the first time in europe, over several months, high-volume data from a low-earth orbiting spacecraft and then distributed it to various centres in europe. when olympus was launched on 12 july 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands. olympus users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the eurostep distance-learning organisation. as the new technologies and services tested by these olympus users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of eutelsat. olympus utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994, when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the end of its design life.

(it was a few months before _the abyss_ came out.) as far as i can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid: - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort (let alone anything else) - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?) so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co2, so even if you can get enough oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough co2 out. - oxygen/co2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume. oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that... -- wim lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu

are breathable liquids possible? i remember seeing an old nova or the nature of things where this idea was touched upon (it might have been some other tv show). if nothing else, i know such liquids are possible because... they showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in it. since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail. the thing struggled quite a bit, but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid. it never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top. now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly shows breathable liquids can be made. -- *isaac kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)	* ___ *					* _____/_o_\_____ *	twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,	*(==(/_______\)==) *	keep it less than 5 lines big.	* \==\/ \/==/

ed campion headquarters, washington, d.c. april 23, 1993 (phone: 202/358-1780) kyle herring johnson space center, houston (phone: 713/483-5111) release: 93-76 hubble telescope servicing mission scheduled for eleven days 	the december flight of endeavour on space shuttle mission sts-61 to service the hubble space telescope (hst) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed. 	the decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or evas, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual eva tasks on previous missions. 	"basically what we've done by going to five evas rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," mission director randy brinkley said. "it improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations." 	in laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the wide field/planetary camera (wf/pc) and installing the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement (costar) are priority objectives during the mission. 	"when we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, wf/pc and costar -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five evas were deemed appropriate," said milt heflin, lead flight director for the mission. 	while the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four evas. 	"we have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five evas," heflin said. "in planning for all space shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives." 	planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the mission control center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours. in addition, many stand alone underwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk. 	various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission. also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the sts-61 crew in its training techniques. 	endeavour's june flight and discovery's july mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the hst mission. the evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the johnson space center, houston, and the marshall space flight center, huntsville, ala. 	also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers. 	designed to be serviced by a space shuttle crew, hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures. 	the telescope was launched aboard discovery in april 1990. at that time the nasa mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to hst in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary. - end - ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.

from the "jpl universe" april 23, 1993 sirtf is still very much in business by mark whalen in these times of extra-tight nasa budgets, the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain. but thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months, jpl's space infrared telescope facility (sirtf) -- a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "alive and well," according to project scientist michael werner. a lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientific power" and a bright future, said werner. designed as a follow-up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite (iras) and cosmic background explorer (cobe) missions, sirtf -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled. iras' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10 years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never before and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25 comets. it provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than any previously available from ground-based observations. cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe. but to illuminate sirtf's potential, jim evans, jpl's manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre-projects, recently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times more capable than iras," based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays. however, despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration sirtf promised, and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s (by the national academy of sciences), it took a "diet or die" directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project going, according to werner. the project is now known as atlas sirtf, based on the key factor in its new design: the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth, permitting the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan. "the main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," werner said. the other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it's in a better thermal environment, away from the heat of the earth." additional major changes in sirtf's redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan -- atlas sirtf will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds) compared to titan sirtf's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds). all of that adds up to "a less stressful launch environment," werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200 million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller, less massive spacecraft. werner said sirtf's redesign came as a result of congress' telling nasa "you're trying to do too many things. if you want us to support sirtf, which is a good project, develop a plan to see how it fits into (nasa's) overall strategy." shortly thereafter, sirtf was named as nasa's highest priority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee, in addition to the blessing from the national academy of sciences. while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive, sirtf's major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens of thousands of times faster" than before, according to evans. "up until a couple of years ago," werner said, "all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors. since then, the department of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and those are very well suited for use on sirtf." werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures, congress is currently watching nasa projects with an eye out for any "technological spinoff." "on that question, i think we have some things to say," he said, "because the detectors we're using are straight off various military developments. also, sirtf will be built by the u.s. aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project. "sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community," werner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premium on observing time. we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data." werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf's three instruments -- the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer. however, these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability, he said. the project hopes to start a "phase b" activity in 1995, which will provide a detailed concept for development and design. building the hardware would begin about two years later. projected cost estimates, evans said, are $850 million-$950 million.

from the "jpl universe" april 23, 1993 cosmologist stephen hawking tours lab by karre marino some 15 years after his first visit to jpl, prof. stephen hawking, lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge university and author of "a brief history of time," returned to the lab april 5. on a tour hosted by jpl chief scientist dr. moustafa chahine and merle mckenzie, manager of the international affairs office, hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with lab director dr. edward stone and various project scientists and managers, and felt "like royalty," he said. hawking, whose theories attempt to explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate dimensions, wanted to re-visit jpl, he explained, "because while i'm most interested in those things in space that are farther away, i know that here is where the first steps are taken." hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate students and his aides, began the tour in von karman auditorium, as david evans, deputy assistant lab director in the office of flight projects, and dr. arden albee, mars observer's project scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects. voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. should extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, evans noted, they would find a variety of images that would explain something of earth. the professor asked if we were still communicating with the spacecraft, and evans affirmed that we are. using a model of mars observer, albee spent several minutes describing the project and the spacecraft's features. in answer to a question from hawking, chahine described a proposed drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's only a concept." chahine, who had met hawking at caltech about five years before, described the professor as "a living miracle of the power of the brain. he's miraculous, and he has such a good sense of humor." the next stop, a demonstration on scientific data visualization in section 384's digital image animation lab, entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles to view 3-d images of mars. project scientist dr. eric de jong showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been discovered in orbit close to jupiter. hawking was curious about its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he asked several questions on their interpretation. norman haynes, ald, office of telecommunications and data acquisition, briefed the professor on the space flight operations facility, and then hawking spoke with stone. the day ended with two technical discussions of particular interest to the professor. technical group leader dr. frank estabrook and senior research scientist hugo wahlquist described a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way. then planetary astronomer dr. richard terrile explained the philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection. the hawking party, which had been visiting southern california for five weeks, was headquartered at caltech, and planned to leave for england within a few weeks after the lab tour. upon departing, the cambridge-based scientist promised chahine that he would return to jpl for another visit. ### ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.

from the "jpl universe" april 23, 1993 vlbi project meets with international space agencies by ed mcnevin members of jpl's space very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) project team recently concluded a week-long series of meetings with officials from russia and japan. the meetings were part of "space vlbi week" held at jpl in early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the u.s. space vlbi project, a recently approved jpl flight project set for launch in 1995. u.s. space vlbi will utilize two earth-orbiting spacecraft -- the japanese vsop (vlbi space observing program) satellite with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a russian radioastron 10-meter satellite. both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10. japan's vsop satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to conduct imaging science, while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger, 28-hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy. each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth. according to dr. joel smith, jpl's project manager for the u.s. space vlbi, meetings like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia, who have little previous experience in radio interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the space vlbi project. "one of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination, because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects," said smith. three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in japan, russia and green bank, w.va. this global network of ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro, n.m. the correlator will combine and process data, then make it available to mission investigators in moscow, tokyo, and jpl via electronic mail. smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space. "there is a long history of radio astronomy using ground-based telescopes," said smith. "what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit. our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy." smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic nuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect." he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel the jets. smith hopes that "by using space vlbi to look further into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved." russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and transmitters, are now being tested in the united states, and japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year. analysis of this hardware will permit u.s. scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed vlba correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 ground-based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi. smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials -- like those held at jpl in march -- have proceeded smoothly. yet he knows that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country's participation in the project. "nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the russians have been incredibly open with us. we always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard, and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level." smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission. "the japanese have been extremely cooperative, since international cooperation is essential to their science mission," he said. but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look at the u.s. space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft, and their highly regarded mach v launch vehicle. yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project, jpl's smith is satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project. "fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and if either falls out, we would still have something with the other. by themselves, both spacecraft are independent, scientifically exciting missions." ### ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.

i have 19 (2 mb worth!) uuencode'd gif images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative space station designs being considered in crystal city. mr. mark holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov. mark proposed this design, which he calls "geode" ("rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside") or the "et strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge." as you can see from file geodea.gif, it uses a space shuttle external tank (et) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of space station freedom. the white track on the outside of the et is used by the station remonte manipulator system (srms) and by the reaction control system (rcs) pod. this allows the rcs pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (cg) of the station as the mass properties of the station change during assembly. the inline module design allows the shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the station's cg and at a structurally strong part of the station. in the current ssf design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system. the et would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass. we've always had the ability to put an et into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint). once on-orbit, we would vent the residual h2. the et insulation (sofi) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment. option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection. the et is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits. the white module at the end of et contains a set of control moment gyros to be used for attitude control, while the rcs will be used for gyro desaturation. the module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with skylab). the centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans. the centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system. the centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the et and the solar panels. this design uses most of the existing ssf designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the ssf work done to date. mark proposed this design at joe shea's committee in crystal city, and he reports that he was warmly received. however, the rumors i hear say that a design based on a wingless space shuttle orbiter seems more likely. please note that this text is my interpretation of mark's design; you should see his notes in the gif files. instead of posting a 2 mb file to sci.space, i tried to post these for anon-ftp in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space. i'll let you all know when i get that done. -- ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 "...development of the space station is as inevitable as the rising of the sun." -- wernher von braun

ethnocentric usian that i am, i've assumed that we and the xussr were the only countries with significant capabilities to track non-cooperative objects in low earth orbit. grazing in a couple of databases recently, i found that japan has some optical capabilities along this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). abstracts of the articles are appended. this leads to the more general question: do yet other people than the us, russia, and japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and why? allen thomson saic mclean, va, usa ----------------------------------------------------------------------- abstracts optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite (egs) takabe, masao; itabe, toshikazu; aruga, tadashi radio research laboratory, review (issn 0033-801x), vol. 34, march 1988, p. 23-34. in japanese, with abstract in english. this paper reports the optical tracking results of egs (experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on august 13, 1986, by nasda. the egs optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the radio research laboratory (rrl) optical ground <---- station are discussed. a star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described. the accuracy of egs tracking data obtained by rrl at the request of nasda is also discussed. in addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the japanese amateur satellite (jas-1) which was launched with the egs, was accurately determined by means of a <---- satellite tracking video. it is clear from this experiment that <---- optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very <---- useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch <---- stages. furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these <---- two satellite optical tracking techniques. <---- mu radar measurements of orbital debris sato, toru; kayama, hidetoshi; furusawa, akira; kimura, iwane (kyoto university, japan) aiaa, nasa, and dod, orbital debris conference: technical issues and future directions, baltimore, md, apr. 16-19, 1990. 10 p. rpn: aiaa paper 90-1343 distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power vhf doppler radar (mu radar) of japan. an automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from norad tracking radar <---- observations using a much higher frequency. it is found that the <---- collision frequency of a space station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years. monitoring of the mu radar antenna pattern by satellite ohzora (exos-c) sato, t.; inooka, y.; fukao, s.

(their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.) but i've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic. so i know the skies are rarely perfect. but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way. (i mean they've been trying this forever - like, concerning tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!) i don't watch commercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high. if ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life. to be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage of hst in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight friday at 8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from baltimore vicinity. i'll be trying to see it if i can - it _is_ my mealticket after all. so i suppose i could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others. be that as it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. regards, wm. hathaway baltimore md

i've been following discussions about the delta clipper program, and i have one small question. as i understand it, the dc-x derived orbital vehicle (dc-y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not completely nose-first. so why is the dc-y look symmetric in every drawing i've seen? i would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like wingless orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the top side. can anybody explain? - ken kobayashi kkobayas@husc.harvard.edu -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ken kobayashi | kkobayas@husc.harvard.edu | "there is no final frontier." - ibm ad
i've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. i've transcribed some of my notes below. since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine. permission is granted to copy this without restriction. note for newbies: the delta clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle. the dc-x vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto. it is currently undergoing tests. the dc-y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit. it has not yet been funded. on april 6th, rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled "optimizing techniques for advanced space missions" here at the university of illinois. mr nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements. although he is not directly involved with the delta clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications. he thus used the dc-y project for most of his examples. while i don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (i hope they aren't - i fell asleep during that part), i think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples. the first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit. the main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 gs. i assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but i did not verify that. the delta clipper y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers. the boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight. thus, one critical question is when to shut them down. mr nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time: ______ 3 g /| / | / | / | as ascii graphs go, this is actually fairly / | / |	 good. the big difference is that the lines 2 g / |/ | made by the / should be curves which are / | concave up. the data is only approximate, as / | the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 g / | | | 0 g | ^ ^ ~100 sec ~400 sec as mentioned before, a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below 3. initially, all eight engines are started. as the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration increases. as it gets close to 3g, the booster engines are throtled back. however, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether. this causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds. eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the g level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely. the engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit. the trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired. questions from the audience: (paraphrased) q: would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than all at once? a: very perceptive. worth considering. they have not yet done the simulation. shutting down all four was part of the problem as given. q: so what was the final payload for this trajectory? a: can't tell us. "read aviation leak." he also apparently had a good propulsion example, but was told not to use it. my question: does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting national security or md protecting their own interests? the second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver. the biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange. he showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and i think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. the end result was that for a polar orbit landing at ksc, the dc-y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude. i would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile. -- josh hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 		 "find a way or make one." 	 -attributed to hannibal
i've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. i've transcribed some of my notes below. since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine. permission is granted to copy this without restriction. michael sternberg, cheif of operations of rimsat, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois. acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control, disarmament and international security. rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites. i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program. the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson (?) went to tonga to visit a friend. while he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big tv fan. matt bought the king a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty. since tonga has a gnp of about $70 million, his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this. matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots. while this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots. the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting tonga's case. eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 e to 170 e (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). according to sternberg, four of these, from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim. rimsat was formed to use these slots. it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven. they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion. it's not easy to raise that kind of money. eventually, they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware. they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware. mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don't think i'll visit there for a long time. besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate. for example "everybody can sell you everything." everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by. eventually, rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million. however, glavkosmos lost favor after the coup. sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures. since glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities. he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms. eventually, he worked out a deal and on dec 4, 1992 he met with koptev, who heads the russian space program, to sign the deal. koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat. the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, npo applied mechanics -- npo pm to use their acronym. this organization is located in siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, i need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age. sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites. they are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners. at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-) sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm. his company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.it apparently costs the russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west. if you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite. for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year. this compares to $810,000 t/y in the u.s. they can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the u.s. rimsat will launch their satellites on protons. to get the best prices, they bought in bulk. they have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address. the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians, which is being moved into place now. tidbits: * sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier." * russian launches are self insured. the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months. * major investors in rimsat include russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in u.s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off. * he downplayed the instabilites in the ex-ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith. italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don't worry because we're used to it. he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won't worry about their stability as much. * part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money. the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in rubles. to get around this, rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account. npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government. * one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry. however, intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring. * the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime. the older gorizont (horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years. while this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, sternberg downplayed the difference. at these prices they can afford to launch new ones. in addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. -- josh hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 		 "find a way or make one." 	 -attributed to hannibal

(these measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of grb with a different origin in the data. i am assuming that there is only one population of grbs). the data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution. the only things the earth is at the exact center of are the solar system (at the scale of the oort cloud of comets way beyond pluto) and the universe. cosmological theories, placing grbs throughout the universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds. oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics. if grbs were galactic (i.e. distributed through the milky way galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population). we don't see this, so if they are galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see grbs from the andromeda galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.) for comparison, the earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy. >my own pet theory is that it's flying saucers entering >hyperspace :-) the aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from zeta reticuli and tau ceti. >but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they >are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes, i just wondered >if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in. there are more than 130 grb different models in the refereed literature. right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. -- 		david m. palmer		palmer@alumni.caltech.edu 					palmer@tgrs.gsfc.nasa.gov

somebody mentioned a re-boost of hst during this mission, meaning that weight is a very tight margin on this mission. how will said re-boost be done? grapple, hst, stow it in cargo bay, do oms burn to high altitude, unstow hst, repair gyros, costar install, fix solar arrays, then return to earth? my guess is why bother with usingthe shuttle to reboost? why not grapple, do all said fixes, bolt a small liquid fueled thruster module to hst, then let it make the re-boost. it has to be cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug. that way, now that they are going to need at least 5 spacewalks, then they can carry an edo pallet, and sit on station and even maybe do the solar array tilt motor fix. pat

re: space billboards even easier to implement than writing messages on the moon, once upon a time a group of space activists i belonged to in seattle considered a "goodyear blimp in orbit". the idea was to use a large structure that could carry an array of lights like the goodyear blimp has. placed in a low earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually be seen by almost everyone on earth. only our collective disapproval of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing it. it had quite feasible economics, which i will not post here because i don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such a thing, go figure it out for yourself). dani eder -- dani eder/meridian investment company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/ rt.1, box 188-2, athens al 35611/location: 34deg 37' n 86deg 43' w +100m alt.

commercial space news/space technology investor number 22 this is number twenty-two in an irregular series on commercial space activities. the commentaries included are my thoughts on these developments. sigh... as usual, i've gotten behind in getting this column written. i can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in the space biz. this column is put together at lunch hour and after the house quiets down at night, so data can quickly build up if there's a lot of other stuff going on. i've complied a lot of information and happenings since the last column, so i'm going to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length. have fun! contents: 1- us commercial space sales flatten in 1993 2- delta wins two key launch contracts 3- commercial remote sensing venture gets doc "go-ahead" 4- investment firm calls gd's space biz "still a good investment" 5- ariane predicts dip in launch demand 6- ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort 7- another pegasus competitor is announced 8- georgia launch site dropped from planning 9- spain's capricornia launcher still proceeding 10- pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp 11- china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported 12- south korea announces national move into space technologies 13- space technology indexes through march final notes articles -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1- us commercial space sales flatten in 1993 the us department of commerce projects us commercial space sales will remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent growth over 1992. as published in "us industrial outlook 1993" (which was released in january), revenues from the 1993 us space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 m. in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the us satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 m in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 m in 1993. the us industrial outlook also projects u.s. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 m, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward revision in department of defense launch plans." offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 m, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable tv networks. similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 m in 1993 (up 15%). us commercial space revenues 1989 1990 1991 1992(r) 1993(e) commercial satellites 900 1,000 1,100 1,300 670 satellite services 750 800 1,200 1,500 1,900 fixed (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520) mobile (50) ( 65)( 85)( 225) ( 380) satellite ground equip 790 860 1,350 1,400 1,560 mobile equipment (40) (85) (280) (352) ??? commercial launches 150 570 380 450 450 remote sensing data and services 125 155 190 215 250 private microgravity research lab -- -- -- -- 60 ===== ===== ====== ===== ===== total annual revenues 2,715 3,385 4,220 4,815 4,890 (r) = revised data for 1992 (e) = estimated data for 1993 [commentary: this is the first look at how the us commercial space industry is expected to do in 1993. in general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area. there, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection. if we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business. furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year. data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the january data set. doc usually publishes a listing of "space business indicators" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then. i expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 m, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising. the doc projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's. my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years. (my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services. i don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born leo communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.) it should also be noted this year's doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities. the $60 m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module, planned for launch in april on the space shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation, which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts. motorola inc. announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite iridium leo communications constellation, and in mid april, mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract. the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium satellites. another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle launches. these 45 satellites planned for the delta will be launched 5 at a time, providing for at least 9 launches. additional satellites in the iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on delta. although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final. the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc, bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher. this contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002. these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf's global positioning system block iir navigation satellites, plus other programs. first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to 6 deltas per year for at least 6 years. under this contract the usaf can also request "launch on demand" services from mdc for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request. [commentary: if these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for mdc's delta launch program through the turn of the century. combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 m to mdc, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 m/year. other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for nasa medium elv-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company. however, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts. motorola's iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u.s., nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture. without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches. but, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. similarly, the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls/"spacelifter" program. at this time, while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed, future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews. some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all "elv upgrade" programs (including the mlv programs) in favor of the proposed "spacelifter" program. such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget.] 3- commercial remote sensing venture gets doc "go-ahead" the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce's office of space commerce. a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland, california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the earth. [commentary: there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license. this was reported to be at the request of worldview. most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a "star wars" spinoff, using sdi-type technology to provide digital earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing/gis users. most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners. it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 land remote sensing policy act. the act, as passed last november, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices. prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set landsat data prices. there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development. i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so. in contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and i believe, can find profitability on the margin. i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.] 4- investment firm calls gd's space biz "still a good investment" wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic's space systems division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 atlas launches. in a recent analyst's report morgan stanley said "we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit." based upon discussions with gd's corporate management, morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 m per year by 2000. this is based upon gd's projection of capturing about 10 atlas launches per year on the world market. [commentary: three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic's space systems division. since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating gd's space business might be next to be sold. the morgan stanley report indicates gd's space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together. sales are projected to be about $560 m in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 m. if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales. but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses. in response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability. to do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm. in gd ssd's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur, as well as in selling atlas services. this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services. optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well. candidates for this might be trw, rockwell, lockheed, and martin, and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing. but most of those firms have cash flow problems (mdc), have had a substantial business contraction (boeing and mdc), are involved with other launch firms (lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (martin). and coming up with the $700-1500 m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.] 5 - ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace, the operator of the ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's. in early february, arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade. over short run, arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market. of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, ariane holds contracts for 31, general dynamics' atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, mcdonnell douglas' delta holds 7, and great wall's long march vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. three-quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, earth observation, and scientific satellites. most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia/pacific region. arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in geo. demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, arianespace predicts demand will decrease. arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply, particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders. one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including russian launch systems. but arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. [commentary: ariane releases their market surveys annually, and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn/sti. comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers. the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit. i note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand. fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point a to established point b. to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars. for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution. and if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network. this allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high. the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic. since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy. but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes. current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites. this has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals. and as last note; arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term. the annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year. from the supply side, ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, atlas is capable of 6-12, long march 4-8, japan's h-vehicle 2-4, russia's proton capable of 8, and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year. that's a lot of capability for a small market. we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.] 6- ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules. a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules. in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed. such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island, va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch. somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call. fortunately, the pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed. but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board (ntsb) with support from nasa, osc, and the air force. this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch. according to the ntsb, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch. [commentary: this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch. their leadership was requested by the department of commerce's office of commercial space transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch. at the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press. apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch. according to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. somehow, the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b-52 carrying the pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch. differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch. as we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved. this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems). i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted icbm components. two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "aerokosmos" winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus, and the "severkosmos", launched from a mobile ground transporter. the aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km. also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called 'sineva'. tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system, they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad, outside of moscow. [commentary: there's very little released information on this new venture. my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-soviet launch systems. it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-soviet union. this one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-soviet icbms, but i can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.] 8- georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january, georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county, georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast. the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations. however, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. [commentary: this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site. while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development. this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site. these include: - is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs? - is there a market advantage of using the site? - can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site? - can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment? other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at woomera, poker flat, cape york, white sands, alabama off-shore platform, hawaii, and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria. in my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.] 9- spain's capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts, former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms. one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster. with that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period. the capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 kg into leo. several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary islands. originated by inta in spain, the project reports it has $ 30 m in development funding, and will use technology from argentina's condor launch vehicle as well as from the us. [commentary: several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market. small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us/italian scout launcher. however, ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system). this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system. surprisingly enough, esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure. studies have been performed by british aerospace, aerospatiale, deutsche aerospace, and italian organizations, but with the exception of the swedish/pacastro system (reported below), i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware. also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher. there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher/irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. what is known is in feb 1992, the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor 2 missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency (comison nacional de atividades espaciales - cnae). the condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms. the condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid-1980's. fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system. it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994. the us$ 9 m, 181 kg, sac-b satellite will study the earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us. no launch vehicle has yet been selected, but osc's pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro, a small launch firm in herndon, virginia announced in late february it had received a $6 m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro's pa-2 launch vehicle. this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service (pss), a joint norwegian space center/ swedish space corp. program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions. according to pacastro, pss is also performing an $8 m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa-2. pacastro has been chosen as "the main alternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya. the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified. [commentary: pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now. the pa-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by rp-1 and liquid oxygen. from pacastro's literature, the engines designed for the pa-series rockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw, and are capable of putting a 225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit. pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996. my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design, with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro, a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro (headquartered in the same building). the swedish space corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. sumitomo corp. of tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors. pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 k (some sources place this of high as $1 m), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 m needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 m sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works. as reported in the taipei press, china development corp. (cdc), headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party, is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. cdc would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (us $10 m) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels. [commentary: this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid january). in those plans, the national space program office of taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with rocsat-1, a 400 kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997. two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites. trw has been helping taiwan plan this program, budgeted at t$13.6 b (us $530 m) through 2006. i haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot, but there might be a connection. while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures. the reported name for the tiawanese/chinese system is "asiasat- 2", but i don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong-based "asiasat" program involving chinese, hong kong, and other asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model. there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures. but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed. in any case, the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues. this is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea's trade, industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us$22 b in research and development and another us$17 b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies. space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997. the objective of this investment is to raise south korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000. [commentary: south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. i'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market. as part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct 1995 on delta. designated koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula, southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea. south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug 1992, called uribyol-1 (our star) and costing about us $8.8 m. uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year, again on ariane, and will be entirely "made in korea." uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite. this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites, the keos (korean earth observation system) project, which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors. south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001. supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at us $ 500 m between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an expected pullout of u.s. intelligence-gathering systems from the korean peninsula. in conjunction with all of these reported efforts, south korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan, and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc's orbcomm user terminals.). this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies. considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn/sti, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments. the table below summarizes results to the end of march. the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the s&p 500 index. since 90+% of the values included in the index are us firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms. the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. the commercial space technology index has also done quite well, but the pure play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993. we'll keep an eye on these .... index results through march beginning beginning 1 jan 93 to 1992 1993 31 mar 1993 ------- -------- -------- s&p 500 416 436 (+4.7%) 452 (+3.7%) space tech index 267 304 (+13.6%) 373 (+22.7%) comm'l space tech index 167 194 (+16.3%) 222 (+14.2%) space tech pure plays 147 169 (+15.4%) 197 (+16.2%) final notes - what? this column's already full? and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on. as i said at the start of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but i'll have to put them into the next issue. looking ahead, i've got several articles in the works on new happenings with iridium and the leo communications satellite market, more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on the market, new international commercial space ventures, and other interesting developments. and as always, i hope you folks find this stuff useful and interesting -- any and all comments are welcome. ----------------------------------------------------------------- wales larrison space technology investor "felicitas multos habet amicos" p.o. box 2452 seal beach, ca 90740-1452
two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993. first, in february, the russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station. while this "banner" reflector was blank, npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial, as filmed from the mir. the second development, has been that space marketing inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft, is now pushing the "environmental billboard". as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory, the "environmental billboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters. advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'. to help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading sensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the earth's delicate protective ozone layer," according to mike lawson, head of smi. furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. according to imi, "as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer." the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and "adds to the ozone supply." this would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available). but smi estimates that market exposure would be 3-5x that of the people who watched the superbowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000. since smi is located in atlanta, georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta. but back to brian's questions: >and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn >news blip? how serious is this project? is this just in the "wild >idea" stage or does it have real funding? see above. as for serious -- if they can get $15-20 m or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 m for a launch), then it's probably real. they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch. that's a $10-15 m cost they need to raise, right there. and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well. note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already. while i don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, i am an amateur astronomer, and no, i don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but i know of no prohibition of it...), the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising. i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage. (would you spend $15 m to look like an idiot?) (and light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn. for maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence. it might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...) as for having real funding -- none that i can identify. there were about 60 expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment. i haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but i'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more. but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time. and if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest. i don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least i don't think i do...). ------------------------------------------------------------------- wales larrison space technology investor --- maximus 2.01wb
brian yamauchi asks: [regarding orbital billboards...] >and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn >news blip? how serious is this project? is this just in the "wild >idea" stage or does it have real funding? well, i had been collecting data for next edition of the commercial space news/space technology investor... to summarize: space advertising first, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle. for example, the latest gps launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of - mcdonnell douglas (the delta launcher) - rockwell international (who built the gps satellite) - usaf (who paid for the satellite and launch), and - the gps/navstar program office this has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather "public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this. [however, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my opinion.] [and by the way, i note that the dc-x test vehicle has rather prominent mcdonnell-douglas and sdio logos on the side...] there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit. on the shuttle, for example, i know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay. these ventures would be different than "public relations", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization. (for example, painting the et to look like a pepsi can, or putting a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.) adverts on launch vehicles the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a proton launch. (an italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, i remember.) similarly, soviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations. mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the british visiting cosmonaut to mir. now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles. the upcoming conestoga launch (in june) putting the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for arnold schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "the last action hero". besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the comet payload, which will orbit the earth for one month. a concept for this advertising display was published in space news magazine a couple of months ago. (as a side note: robert lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing nasa. he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program. lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming comet, nasa violated an agreement that it "would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and receiving compensation." this is being disputed, since the launch is a "commercial launch" and nasa is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the comet program is coming from nasa.) orbital "billboards" orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for some time. arthur c. clarke wrote about one example, and robert heinlein described another in "the man who sold the moon". several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "eiffel ii" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the french republic's bi-centennial.

(mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the lmc, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) 	as the sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting ns out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the andromeda's bursters. 	the data is consistent with either a oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the universe" ;-) if at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable. 	if we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing. the situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-) [in the colliding ns they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns-ns and ns-bh collision scenarios respectively] my own pet theory is that it's flying saucers entering hyperspace :-) but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes, i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in. if you can think of one, remember to invite me to stockholm... * steinn sigurdsson 			lick observatory 	* * steinly@lick.ucsc.edu		"standard disclaimer" 	* * the laws of gravity are very,very strict			* * and you're just bending them for your own benefit - b.b. 1988*

as for sf and advertising in space. there is a romantic episode in mead's "the big ball of wax" where the lovers are watching the constellation pepsi cola rising over the horizon and noting the some 'stars' had slipped cause the teamsters were on strike. this was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation of space mirrors published in spaceflight in 1986. as the reviews said: this seems technically feasible, and could be commercially viable but is it aesthetically desirable? these days the only aesthetics that count are the ones you can count! -- dave stephenson geological survey of canada ottawa, ontario, canada internet: stephens@geod.emr.ca

larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a "unified field theory" in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations. but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years! the late physicist dewey b. larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, which he calls the "reciprocal system", is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time: (1) "the physical universe is composed entirely of one component, motion, existing in three dimensions, in discrete units, and in two reciprocal forms, space and time." (2) "the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics, its magnitudes are absolute, and its geometry is euclidean." from these two postulates, larson developed a complete theoretical universe, using various combinations of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotational motions, the concepts of in-ward and out-ward scalar motions, and speeds in relation to the speed of light (which larson called "unit velocity" and "the natural datum"). at each step in the development, larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles [incomplete atoms], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, etc.), even objects not yet discovered then (such as exploding galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts). and applying his theory to his new model of the atom, larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of matter. all of this is described in good detail, with-out fancy complex mathematics, in his books. books of dewey b. larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b. larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe. some of the early books are out of print now, but still available through inter-library loan. "the structure of the physical universe" (1959) "the case against the nuclear atom" (1963) "beyond newton" (1964) "new light on space and time" (1965) "quasars and pulsars" (1971) "nothing but motion" (1979) [a $9.50 substitute for the $8.3 billion "super collider".] [the last four chapters explain chemical bonding.] "the neglected facts of science" (1982) "the universe of motion" (1984) [final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries.] "basic properties of matter" (1988) all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers, p.o. box 13255, portland, or 97213, and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library doesn't have each of them. several of them, including the last one, are available from: the international society of unified science (isus), 1680 e. atkin ave., salt lake city, utah 84106. this is the organization that was started to promote larson's theory. they have other related publications, including the quarterly journal "reciprocity". physicist dewey b. larson's background physicist dewey b. larson was a retired engineer (chemical or electrical). he was about 91 years old when he died in may 1989. he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university. he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used. larson's lack of a fancy "ph.d." degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is not a valid reason. sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees. at the same time, it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their contradictions, ad hoc assumptions, principles of impotence, in-consistencies, etc.. larson did not have the funds, etc. to experimentally test his theory. and it was not necessary for him to do so. he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers' experimental and observational data. and in many cases, his explanation fit better. a self-consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have! they claim to be looking for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been ignoring one for over 30 years now! "modern physics" does not explain the physical universe so well. some parts of some of larson's books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree. and remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., also once seemed to explain it well, but were later proved conceptually wrong. prof. frank h. meyer, professor emeritus of uw-superior, was/is a strong proponent of larson's theory, and was (or still is) president of larson's organization, "the international society of unified science", and editor of their quarterly journal "reciprocity". he moved to minneapolis after retiring. "super collider" boondoggle! i am against contruction of the "superconducting super collider", in texas or anywhere else. it would be a gross waste of money, and contribute almost nothing of "scientific" value. most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b. larson, as described in his books, the strange goofy particles ("mesons", "hyperons", alleged "quarks", etc.) which they are finding in existing colliders (fermi lab, cern, etc.) are really just atoms of anti-matter, which are created by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment. a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not seen there before, and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now! are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 billion cost?!! don't we have much more important uses for this wasted money?! another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground cables. how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the "supercollider"?! naming the "super collider" after ronald reagon, as proposed, is totally absurd! if it is built, it should be named after a leading particle physicist. larsonian anti-matter in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, anti-matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles. it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made, in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, which larson calls "unit velocity" and the "natural datum". in larson's theory, a positron is actually a particle of matter, not anti-matter. when a positron and electron meet, the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each other. in larson's theory, the anti-matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time, and only one dimension of space, and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half. larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century. 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets (venus, earth, jupiter, etc.). the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help "prove" einstein's "general theory of relativity". but the late physicist dewey b. larson achieved results closer to the 43 seconds than "general relativity" can, by instead using "special relativity". in one or more of his books, he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury. larson totally rejected "general relativity" as another mathematical fantasy. he also rejected most of "special relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near the speed of light, and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts, (those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 really are moving faster than the speed of light, although most of that motion is away from us in time.). in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, there are three dimensions of time instead of only one. but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe. the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time. at low relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are negligible; but at high speeds, they become significant, and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor. [larson often used the term "coordinate time" when writing about this.] in regard to "mass increases", it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light. but the formula for acceleration is acceleration = force / mass, (a = f/m). orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor: force. in larson's theory, mass stays constant and force drops toward zero. force is actually a motion, or combinations of motions, or relations between motions, including inward and outward scalar motions. the expansion of the universe, for example, is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so-called "big bang" (which is yet another mathematical fantasy). the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book "the universe of motion", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacific publishers, (p.o. box 13255, portland, oregon 97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author, an unrecognized genius, more than thirty years ago. it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries, including the formation of galaxies, binary and multiple star systems, and solar systems, the true origin of the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the true nature of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds! the following is an example of his theory's success: in his first book in 1959, "the structure of the physical universe", larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies, several years before astronomers started finding them. they are a necessary consequence of larson's comprehensive theory. and when quasars were discovered, he had an immediate related explanation for them also. gamma-ray bursts astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma-ray bursts. they were originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the disc of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly, and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence). gamma-ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson. according to page 386 of his book "the universe of motion", published in 1984, the gamma-ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti-matter half of the physical universe, which larson calls the "cosmic sector". because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at random. (this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects, and come from all directions uniformly.) i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth! there would be no way to predict one, nor to stop it! perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past, which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were actually caused by nearby gamma-ray bursts! larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double. but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson. i will try to summarize larsons explanation, which is detailed in chapter 7 of his book "the universe of motion" and in some of his other books. first of all, according to larson, stars do not generate energy by "fusion". a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse. the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements (heavier than iron). each element has a destructive temperature limit. the heavier the element is, the lower is this limit. a star's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements. when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron, there is a type i supernova explosion! this is because there is so much iron present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process, which larson explains in some of his books [better than i can]. when the star explodes, the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light. the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light, because of the high temperature. the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light, and it expands outward in time, which is equivalent to inward in space, and it often actually disappears for a while. over long periods of time, both masses start to fall back gravitationally. the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star. the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star. both stars then start moving back toward the "main sequence" from opposite directions on the h-r diagram. the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space, making a single lone star again, are near zero. they will instead form a binary system, orbiting each other. according to larson, a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient (is densest at its surface), because the material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown outward) in time. this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about "degenerate matter", "neutron stars", "black holes", etc.. larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small, then, instead of a single white dwarf star, there will be several "mini" white dwarf stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably still too far away in three-dimensional time to be affected by its heat, etc.). these will become planets! in chapter 7 of the universe of motion, larson used all this information, and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, to derive his own version of bode's law. "black hole" fantasy! i heard that physicist stephen w. hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two "black holes" merging together into a single "black hole", and concluded that the new "black hole" would have more mass than the sum of the two original "black holes". such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag, causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of "black holes", etc.! after reading physicist dewey b. larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, especially his book "the universe of motion", it is clear to me that "black holes" are nothing more than mathematical fantasies! the strange object at cygnus x-1 is just an unusually massive white dwarf star, not the "black hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to "prove" their theory. by the way, i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking. the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking's severe physical problem somehow makes him "wiser". it does not! i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b. larson while he was still alive. widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson's theory, books, and organization (the international society of unified science). electro-magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago, in connection with ufo's and unorthodox inventors, but i never was able to find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112-113 of the book "basic properties of matter", by the late physicist dewey b. larson, which describes part of larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe. i quote one paragraph: "as indicated in the preceding chapter, the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance. the electrons, we find, are derived from the environment. it was brought out in volume i [larson's book "nothing but motion"] that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited. it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged. in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, and the relation of space to space is not motion. in open space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system, in the manner of a photon. in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system. all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation. meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, whereby electrons are returned to the environment. the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." note that in larson's theory, uncharged electrons are also massless, and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate). ("unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, according to larson's theory.) [i might have the "above" and "below" labels mixed up.] larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass- less un-charged electrons flying around at the speed of light! if this is true, then the electro-magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps giving them a charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion. (in larson's theory, an electrical charge is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the rotation of the particle.) the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds. suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson has been available for more than 30 years, published in 1959 in his first book "the structure of the physical universe". it is totally un-scientific for hawking, wheeler, sagan, and the other sacred priests of the religion they call "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to totally ignore larson's theory has they have. larson's theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. larson's theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, in the u.s. and elsewhere. and at least the basic principles of larson's theory should be included in all related courses at uw-ec, uw-madison, cambridge, cornell university, and elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed. for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (especially larson's books). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important partial summary is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine b.s., physics and astronomy, uw-ec
regarding drag free satellites, joe cain gives a good description of the concept. it is however more than a concept. the navy's triad satellite succesfully used drag free control. drag free control is an integral part of the stanford gravity probe-b spacecraft, due to fly in 1999. it is also part of the european step satellite. jeff v.

soviet union's mighty proton rockets lifted off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan republic. aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe for the planet venus. designated venera 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit. to accomplish this task, the basic venera design was modified in numerous areas. the central bus core was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by the venera 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier. extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging. the dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to earth. atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound) polyus v side-looking radar antennae. the radar system, possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by the soviets for earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map venus' surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). the soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the united states pioneer venus orbiter, which could reveal objects no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter. and while the veneras' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of venus. this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation. on october 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, venera 15 fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours. venera 16 followed suit four days later. the twin probes thus became venus' first polar-circling spacecraft. radar operations began on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20 for venera 16. for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long. the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large soviet antennae on earth. each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer. by the end of their main missions in july of 1984, the veneras had mapped 115 million square kilometers (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet. venera 15 and 16 revealed that venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late 1970s. numerous hills, mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years. in planetary terms this makes the venerean surface rather young. hundreds of craters were detected as well, the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, due to venus' very dense atmosphere. there were some disagreements between u.s. and soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features. for example, the probes' owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high maxwell montes, the tallest mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact. american scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of ishtar terra. in any event, the u.s. decided to wait on making verdicts about venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later in the decade. originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar (voir), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig- nated the venus radar mapper (vrm). eventually the machine would be called magellan, after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan (circa 1480-1521). this vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the veneras. for the time, however, the soviet probes maintained that distinction. radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras. bolted next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's temperatures. the majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees celsius (932 degrees fahrenheit), but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating current volcanic activity. the probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) lower than at the equator. in contrast, the polar air above sixty kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights. when the main mapping mission ended in july of 1984, there were plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes. unfortunately this idea did not come to pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control gas to perform the operation. venera 15 and 16 ceased transmission in march of 1985, leaving the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus. venus by balloon for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of air with balloon-borne instruments. professor jacques blamont of the french space agency centre national d'etudes spatiales (cnes) had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint french-soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982. nevertheless, late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true. when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december 15 and 21, the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear, full views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe since 1975. this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission. the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named vega 1 and 2, a contraction of the words venera and gallei - gallei being the russian word for halley. not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one celestial objective to explore, namely the comet halley. this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910. since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to earth. most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system. some, like halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter. the soviet union, along with the european space agency (esa) and japan's institute of space and astronautical science (isas), did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley. the esa would be using the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet, while japan's first deep space craft - sakigake (pioneer) and suisei (comet) - would view halley from a much safer distance. scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines. however, government budget cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts. the u.s. would have to make do primarily with earth-based observations and the sharing of data from other nations, though an instrument named the dust counter and mass analyzer (ducma), designed by chicago university professor john simpson, was added on the soviet mission in may of 1984. the soviets' answer to halley were the vegas. instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission, the soviets decided to modify their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced venus mission along the way. as vega 1 and 2 reached venus, the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley, much as the u.s. probe mariner 10 used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier. the soviet craft would then head on to halley, helping to pinpoint the location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in march of 1986. as planned, the two vegas arrived at venus in june of 1985. vega 1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander making a two-day descent towards the planet. the craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11. sixty-one kilometers (36.6 miles) above the venerean surface a small container was released by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles) altitude. thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had successfully arrived. one kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was pumped into the teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet). dangling on a tether thirteen meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as an aerostat. the top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon. beneath it was the transmitter, electronics, and instruments. connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles. the aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet's atmosphere. the vega 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just north of the equator. scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data. this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions. the author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to venera 9 and 10 in 1975, when soviet scientists had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover. the first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600 kilometers (6,960 miles). the threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize. the vega 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in 1978. indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) per hour. strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the journey. the layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius (104 degrees fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 earth atmosphere. the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. early in the first balloon's flight, the vega 1 lander was already headed towards the venerean surface. both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera 13 and 14 in 1982. however, vega 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia, the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra. while still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 miles) above the surface. there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing. this was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never before been directly examined. nevertheless, the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees celsius (874.4 degrees fahrenheit) and 95 earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 56 minutes of ground transmissions. a large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site. as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera 11 and 12 had failed in december of 1978, the soviets focused on the data returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere. the french-soviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, and possibly phosphorus. it is the sulfur - possibly from active volcanoes - which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color. the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles) contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid. the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus. the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega 2's results nearly matched its twin. the vegas found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the u.s. probes. the layers were three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles). the clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), much lower than the pv readings. one possibility for the discrepan- cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air over the last seven years. when the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last functioning part of the vega 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley. on march 6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space. the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel. on june 13, vega 2 released its lander/balloon payload for a two-day fall towards venus. like its duplicate, the vega 2 balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet. during its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile) flight over venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission. after 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours. when the balloon passed over a five- kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of aphrodite terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) towards the surface. temperature sensors on the vega 2 balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees celsius (43.7 degrees fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the vega 1 balloon. this was corroborated by the vega 2 lander as it passed through the balloon's level. no positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer failed to function. the vega 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra's western arm on the fifteenth of june, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) southeast of vega 1. the lander's resting place was smoother than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava. the soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, rare on earth but present in luna's highlands. this rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium. a high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil. the air around vega 2 measured 463 degrees celsius (865.4 degrees fahrenheit) and 91 earth atmospheres, essentially a typical day (or night) on venus. far above the vega 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past venus at a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin to comet halley, making a closer flyby on march 9, 1986 at just 8,030 kilometers (4,818 miles). both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three hours. since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley encounters, soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects. one prime target was the near- earth planetoid 2101 adonis, which vega 2 could pass at a distance of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles). sadly, the soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned. vega 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987. future plans diverted the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the sun. one example was the vesta mission, planned for the early 1990s. this soviet-french collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992. the craft would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes. the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over the vega balloons' two days. the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible landing on vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective main belt planetoid as seen from earth. unfortunately for venus exploration, plans began to change in the soviet union. in 1986 the soviets decided to reroute the vesta mission to the red planet mars instead of venus, keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact. by this time in the soviet space program interest was focusing on mars. already under construction was an entirely new probe design called phobos. two members of this class were planned to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mars the next year. phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on mars' largest moon, phobos. all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions, including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and eventually human explorers in the early twenty-first century. the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future. but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars exploration. both phobos probes failed to complete their missions, one losing contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in march of 1989. in 1989 a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in 1998. several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put on indefinite hold. no other official soviet missions to venus have since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet. during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the soviet union. president mikhail gorbachev began to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations, particularly those in the west. while the culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market". these effects hit everywhere, including the space program. missions at all levels were cut back. the soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money. in early 1992 it was reported that the soviets were offering for sale several fully-equipped veneras they had in storage for the price of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary probe. no nation took them up on the bargain. meanwhile the united states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own. magellan and galileo the u.s. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4, 1989. aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft, a combination of spare parts from other u.s. probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar-mapping of venus in history. when magellan reached the second world in august of 1990, it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of venera 15 and 16. in the interim another american probe was launched from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in 1995. on october 18, 1989, the shuttle atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the probe's primary target's major moons in 1610. in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet, the probe was sent around venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach jupiter. as a result, venus became galileo's first planetary goal in february of 1990. the probe radioed back images of the planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere. on the drawing boards with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years, new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus. scien- tists in the u.s. have talked to space scientists in the former soviet union - now the commonwealth of independent states since january 1, 1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions within in the next decade. japan, india, and the esa have also considered their own venus missions in the next few decades. in february of 1993 nasa came up with several new venus projects as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system. for venus two missions were selected for further study: a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air temperature, and pressure; and the venus composition probe, designed to study venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute, much as the soviets had done since 1967. final project decisions will be made in 1994. humans on venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus? at present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something even tougher than a venera lander. plans have been looked into changing the environment of venus itself into something more like earth's. however, it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every 243 earth days. such a project may take centuries if not millennia. in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand venus as its exists today. we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place. will earth ever suffer this fate? perhaps venus holds the answers. such answers may best be found through international cooperation, including the nation which made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from venus. bibliography -

having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, i had assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function. however i always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "no-op" command that does something. if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a "no-op" command. of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- jim cobban | jcobban@bnr.ca | phone: (613) 763-8013 bnr ltd. | bnrgate.bnr.ca!bcars5!jcobban | fax: (613) 763-2626

a bright light phenomenon was observed in the eastern finland on april 21. at 00.25 ut two people saw a bright, luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near mikkeli. the head of the pillar was circular. the lower part was a little winding. it was like a monster they told. they were little frightened. soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged. a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon. at last the light landed behind the nearby forest. now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise. the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in lappeenranta. at 00.26 ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont. the altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees. soon the trail began to grow taller. a loop was appeared in the head of the trail. it was like a spoon. this lasted only 10 seconds. now the altitude was about five degress above horizont. he noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop. the spot was at magnitude -2. the loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop. a cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot. after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont. luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 ut in the morning sky. the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket. i don't know if there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in finland. most of these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium experiments and other chemical releases. during these years we have observed 17 satellite launches. leo wikholm ===================================================================== ursa astronomical association i phone : +358-0-174048 satellite and rocket phenomena sect. i fax : +358-0-657728 laivanvarustajankatu 9 c 54 i bbs : +358-0-174341 fin-00140 helsinki i inter : leo.wikholm@compart.fi finland i =====================================================================

introducing the back to the moon in congress: the next step the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase act is introduction of the act in congress. at this point, many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. however, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. due to his position as chair of the house committee on space and science, congressman george brown is the logical choice. he has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements act. there is a small group of activists in southern california who have assisted george brown in his recent re-election campaigns. we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown about the back to the moon bill. we are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting america back to the moon. finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write george brown to have him introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993. all this should produce a positive reaction from brown's office. as more is known, it will be passed on. however, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill, this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. for any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. the latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose. this means that the introduction of the lunar resources data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill. to accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the lunar resources data purchase act - now. to wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill. if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians. if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill, please request a copy by email (please include your u.s. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the national space society). --- maximus 2.01wb

the following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet..... redesign activities update -- following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by nasa headquarters. the station redesign team (srt) provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22. the day-long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city, va; topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held. the design teams then presented the three options under study: � option a - modular buildup -- pete priest presented the a option. priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called "bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and spacelab. the power station capability could be achieved in 3 flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kw of power. 30-day shuttle/spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase. human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u.s. common module module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase. � option b - freedom derived -- mike griffin presented the status of option b activities. griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom-derived option, from initial research capability, to human-tended capability, to permanent human presence capability, to two fault tolerance, and finally permanent human capability. griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the communications and tracking system, crew health care system and eclss, and a major change to the data management system. initial research capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kw of power. human-tended capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the u.s. lab. permanent human presence capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return. two fault tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules, thermal control and propulsion systems. the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flights. three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles (acrv) would complete the permanent human capability with international stage. griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option. major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said. � option c - singe launch core station -- chet vaughn presented option c, the single launch core station concept. a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit. shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation. the module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by a centralized passageway. seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements. this "can" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude. in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee, bryan o'connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on april 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin. the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3. russian consultants arrive in u.s. -- a delegation of 16 russian space experts arrived in the u.s. on april 21 and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the 22nd. the group includes russian space agency general director y. m. koptev, and v. a. yatsenko, also of the rsa. others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense, the design bureau salyut, the institute of biomedical problems, the ministry of foreign affairs, npo energia and tsnijmash. the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the proton launch vehicle, mir operations and utilization, and the soyuz tm spacecraft. the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station, and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign. they will be available to the srt through may 5. management and operations review continues -- work continued in the srt subgroups. the management group under dr. walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations. various management options have been developed including: � lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command. � host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator. � skunk works/dedicated program office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office. � combine space station with shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program. � major tune up to current organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined. the operations group under dr. john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa-jsc, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible. as part of its work, the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations. what's in the week ahead? -- the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin the detailed cost assessment. also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee, to be held may 3. dr. shea steps down -- dr. joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april 22 and bryan o'connor will take over the activities of the team. dr. shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt. mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr. shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated. key milestones -- the key dates for the srt as they are currently being carried on the schedule are: april 26 design freeze on options for costing april 27 design support team present selected options to srt may 3 status report to redesign advisory committee may 15 interim report by redesign advisory committee june 7 final report to redesign advisory committee (oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...ac)

>newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space >subject: re: vandalizing the sky. > my apologies if this is a re-post - i submitted it on friday, but got a message that my post might not have gone out. considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are too inalienable rights damn it! the majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot), i suspect that my post did not get out of my site. (i ain't saying that dark skies are included in these rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) anyway, here are my thoughts on this: i'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers. some of what i would complain about is rooted in aesthetics. many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans. the space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be. with full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men. whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife. the space age changed all that. the effect of the first sputniks and echo, etc. on this view could only happen once. to see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe. but there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. yes, i know aircraft are almost always in sight. i have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly. the impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man. in some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats). i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then i quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles - 60-80 miles to the east. (their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.) but i've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic. so i know the skies are rarely perfect. but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way. (i mean they've been trying this forever - like, concerning tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!) i don't watch commercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high. if ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life. to be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage of hst in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight friday at 8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from baltimore vicinity. i'll be trying to see it if i can - it _is_ my mealticket after all. so i suppose i could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others. be that as it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. regards, wm. hathaway baltimore md (p.s. added tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)

i didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, i just wanted to add a point. the whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the definition of a right. moral rights and natural rights are all well and good, but as far as i can see, a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce. in most civilizations, the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and then enforces those rights for them. here in the u.s., the constitution provides a "bill of rights" from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive. i'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents. if you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights (in the u.s.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched. to keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the international court of justice (correct name?) in the hague, something i know little about. doug loss loss@husky.bloomu.edu
the european space agency has involvement with remote earth observation, and i presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.). so it's not just the us/ussr(ex) who are in the game. but what *is* the game? what can be done with space observation? the military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well documented, but what about anything else? the biggest eg i can think of is to get a metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for precious metals. more importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and *underground water* from space. this would be a positive life saver for african or other drought affected countries. implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably. so how about it? is there a charity or government agency that would pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits mapped? or is this still sci-fi? mail replies would be great. thought for the day: thermal energy needs water to make steam so sstick it in the ocean! -- **************************************************************************** marvin batty - djf@uk.ac.cov.cck "and they shall not find those things, with a sort of rafia like base, that their fathers put there just the night before. at about 8 o'clock!"

come on, this is sci.space. an orbital billboard won't do any permanent damage; in a few years it will reenter and probably hit los angles anyway :-) the boost to space commerce orbital advertising might provide might speed the day it is possible for those with a yen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond the dust producing the zodiacal light. now, if they wanted to paint the cocacola symbol on the moon in lampblack, that would give me pause. it would be very difficult to reverse such a widespread application of pigments. -- thomas clarke institute for simulation and training, university of central fl 12424 research parkway, suite 300, orlando, fl 32826 (407)658-5030, fax: (407)658-5059, clarke@acme.ucf.edu

yesterday, i went to the boeing shareholders meeting. it was a bit shorter than i expected. last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs. this year, it was much more bare-bones. in any case, i wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so i got there early, and figured that if i didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so i wrote it down, and handed it in. after the meeting started, mr. shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs. naturally, i was crushed. so, when question and answer time came, i was suprised to find my question being read and answered. admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference. so, on to the substance. the question was is boeing looking at anything beyond the high speed civil transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by mcdonnell douglass? well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first. this is to the best of my recollection what he said. as far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers about that. as far as commercialization, that is a long ways off. the high speed civil transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point. so, this tells me that boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own. now, i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing. actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts. he won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the tsto action is taking place at boeing. at the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it. anybody know anything further? is this really news? does this threaten further work on dc-? ? john.

although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space business called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd congress. this is the back to the moon bill, put together by the people who passed the launch services purchase act. the bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. there is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million. having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the delta clipper program has shown (dc-x was funded by sdio at $59 million). we have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true. please support the back to the moon bill. for more information, please send e-mail with your u.s. postal service address. --- maximus 2.01wb

thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance. unfortunately, i apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, rather than space surveillance what i meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). the us uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating quasi-radar operated by the navy, to do this for satellites in leo, and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. the fee, i understand, does much the same thing. amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches and pcs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. see the fascinating books by desmond king-hele for details, as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov. the material posted in my previous message suggests that japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be that other countries do also. which was the question i meant to ask: who are they, how do they do it, and why do they do it? allen thomson saic mclean, va ------------------------------------------------------------------------- oh, yes: i don't speak for saic.

(book review): "the universe of motion", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacific publishers, portland, oregon, 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. "the universe of motion" contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries. this book is volume iii of a revised and enlarged edition of "the structure of the physical universe", 1959. volume i is "nothing but motion" (1979), and volume ii is "the basic properties of matter" (1988). most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial differentials, and other fancy mathematics. in this book, by contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text. larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual validity. dewey b. larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university. he developed the theory described in his books while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements they contain. "the universe of motion" describes the astrophysical portions of larson's consistent, integrated, comprehensive, general unified theory of the physical universe, a kind of "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and astro-physicists claim to be looking for. it is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time: (1) the physical universe is composed entirely of one component, motion, existing in three dimensions, in discrete units, and with two reciprocal aspects, space and time. (2) the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics, its primary magnitudes are absolute, and its geometry is euclidean. from these two postulates, larson was able to build a complete theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the concept of inward and outward scalar motions with translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational- vibrational motions. at each step in the development, he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including even things not yet discovered. for example, in his 1959 book, he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies, several years before astronomers started finding them. they are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory. and when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation ready for those also. as a result of his theory, which he called "the reciprocal system", larson totally rejected many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass increases, relativistic doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be nothing more than mathematical fantasies. he was very critical of the ad hoc assumptions, uncertainty principles, solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc., used to maintain them. "the universe of motion" is divided into 31 chapters. it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the anti-matter half of the physical universe. (galaxy formation from the mythical "big bang" is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers.) he then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of single stars. several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according to larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light (although most of that speed is away from us in time). astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an open mind. for example, they used to believe that gamma ray bursts originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence). larson's explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti-matter half of the physical universe, which larson calls the "cosmic sector". because the anti-matter universe exists in a reciprocal relation to our material universe, with the speed of light as the boundary between them, and has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space, the bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly at random. larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books, journal articles, and leading physicists and astronomers. in this book, 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book. for example, a quote from the book "astronomy: the cosmic journey", by william k. hartmann, says, "our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form.... unfortunately we cannot." larson's book contains logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are worthy of serious consideration by all physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists. for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (larson's books). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important book review is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine b.s., physics and astronomy, uw-ec
mike adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight to the human being. i love this topic, as some of you regulars know. so, having seen henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; i shall. i feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and probably more. i do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society. in the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort. i believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media. a well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public. the objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area. in addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration. individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles. in addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of nasa and industry. i have appreciated the positive responses to date and i am personally eager to start this project. perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight. ken

well, i seem to have struck an interesting discussion off. given that i am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist, i'll have to boil it down a bit. 1) all the data on bursts to date, shows a smooth random distribution. 2) that means they aren't concentrated in galactic cores, our or someone elses. 3) if the distribution is smooth, we are either seeing some enormously large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena 	or we are seeing some phenomena out at like the oort cloud, but then it needs some potent little energy source, that isn't detectable by any other current methods. 4) we know it's not real close, like slightly extra solar, because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts. 5) the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like that. so everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile. what i am wondering, is this in people's opinion, a new physics problem. einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect. copernicus, started looking at irregularities in planetary motion. is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics? just a little speculative thinking folks. pat

( british local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as i can see ) i suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one. illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although i do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing. -- __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| peter card, joint european torus, abingdon | | | |_. | | | oxfordshire ox14 3ea uk. tel 0235-464867 fax 464404 | | | _| | | | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366 ._| | | |_. | | | it wasnt me. it was the others. they made me do it. --`--~'-+---+-+-+----+------------------------------------------------------- - disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the jet project.

> i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for > humans. i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere > evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet. the question > is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. this is a good question. there are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable. for example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does? the naive answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete. photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten. what is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material. on earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources. however, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered). this suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere. in particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere. there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment. no convincing feedback mechanism has been identified. perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 myr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it. 	paul f. dietz 	dietz@cs.rochester.edu

ron miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career. i've admired both his paintings (remember the usps solar system exploration stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight. for several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets. a brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and i thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long). especially given the net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft... ================================== the dream machines: an illustrated history of the spaceship in art, science, and literature by ron miller with foreword by arthur c. clarke krieger publishing company melbourne, florida, usa orig. ed. 1993 pre-publication $84.50 isbn 0-89464-039-9 this text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon. the idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century. the need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years. as soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them. tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering. once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter. these also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are: they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge. virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically. the chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures. they also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries. they reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected. every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration. nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing. this allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences. this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams. science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating. the unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship. special features includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject. this includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromsoviet spacecraft;

(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph) yesterday, in response to henry spencer's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, i said "dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 k." well, i was dead wrong. our local interstellar dust expert, bruce draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far ir, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 kelvin. sorry, henry, and anyone else i misled. obviously, time for me to take another ism class :-( in other news, alan stern of the southwest research institute gave a talk on the pluto-charon binary system yesterday. he gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of pluto-charon. his idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies. most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with jupiter and saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially uranus and neptune. a large planetesimal was captured by neptune - we call it triton [captured how? perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!]. he notes that the two recently discovered "kuiper belt" objects, 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw, plus chiron and pholus, are all about the same mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of triton and pluto/charon. pluto/charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-pluto, knocking some material into a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon; similar to ideas about the formation of earth's moon. there is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different (pluto has methane frost, charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory. he believes that there may be around 1000 pluto-to-chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune's orbit, beyond 35 au or so. 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw are the first members of this population to be found, in his model. note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now. the reason that pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, i think) is that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost. so any bodies much farther away than 30 au are going to be very hard to see. i hope i haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his. by the way, he's one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby mission (i think), and said that the current plans are to use a titan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory" to pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...). he'd like to use a proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs much less. his figures: $500 million for 2 titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 million for 2 proton launches. he told a story about how the soviets originally offered to sell proton launches for $30 million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the us in order to be allowed in the marketplace. i'm just telling you what he said. michael -- ----- michael richmond "this is the heart that broke my finger." richmond@astro.princeton.edu

forwarded from neal ausman, galileo mission director galileo mission director status report post-launch april 23 - 29, 1993 spacecraft 1. on april 22 and 23, delta differenced one-way range (dor) passes were performed over dss-14/63 (goldstone/madrid 70 meter antennas) and dss-14/43 (goldstone/canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively. initial results indicate the delta dor pass on april 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on april 23 was successfully performed. 2. on april 23, a cruise science memory readout (mro) was performed for the magnetometer (mag) instrument. analysis indicates the data was received properly. 3. on april 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence. these relays were commanded closed by the cds (command data subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (iesd). 4. on april 26, cruise science memory readouts (mro) were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer (mag) instruments. preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly. 5. during the period from april 26 to april 27, a navigation cycle was performed. this navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over dss-63, dss-14, and dss-43. 6. on april 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the radio relay antenna (rra) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on april 28. the rra was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees. preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range. the rra was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow. preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range. the rra motor temperature was at 1 degree c at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees c at its completion. after verifying proper rra slewing, the rra slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april 28. upon successful uplink, a delayed action command (dac) was sent which will reposition the stator on may 4 to its initial pre-test position. also, a dac was sent to turn the two-way noncoherent (twnc) on april 28 prior to the start of the rra slew test mini-sequence. 7. on april 27, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase. 8. on april 28, the rra slew test executed nominally. the spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees. all of the slews were well within the predicted range. the rra motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees c at its completion. after completion of the rra slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration. 9. the ac/dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period. the ac measurement reads 17 dn (3.9 volts). the dc measurement reads 134 dn (15.7 volts). these measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac/dc special anomaly team. 10. the spacecraft status as of april 29, 1993, is as follows: a) system power margin - 75 watts b) spin configuration - dual-spin c) spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner d) spacecraft attitude is approximately 23 degrees off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading) e) downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1 f) general thermal control - all temperatures within acceptable range g) rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range h) orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws, euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds i) probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within acceptable range j) cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours time to initiation - 203 hours gds (ground data systems): 1. the first galileo-gds test of the mgds v18.0 command system (cmd) took place april 27, 1993 with dss-61 (madrid 34 meter antenna). the test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new dsn (deep space network) group 5 command processor assembly (cpa). the test was successful and the next test for v18.0 cmd is scheduled for may 1, 1993 with dss-15 (goldstone 34 meter antenna). 2. the april system engineers monthly report(semr)/ground system development office (gsdo) mmr was conducted thursday, april 29. a review of current project and institutional (dsn and moso) system status was conducted. on-going cruise development plus the gsdo phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments and potential problem areas were discussed. no significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported. trajectory as of noon thursday, april 29, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory status was as follows: 	distance from earth 187,745,300 km (1.26 au) 	distance from sun 296,335,800 km (1.98 au) 	heliocentric speed 89,100 km per hour 	distance from jupiter 522,015,800 km 	round trip light time 20 minutes, 58 seconds special topic 1. as of april 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been transmitted to galileo since launch. of these, 65150 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process. in the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process. major command activities included commands to perform the initial rra slew test, uplink the rra slew test mini-sequence, dacs to reposition the stator and turn the twnc on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the rra slew test. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.

regarding the feasability of retrieving the hst for repair and relaunching it: (caution: speculation mode engaged) there is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet. i expect that retrieving hst would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay. most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand. they would have to be removed by the astronauts. (the only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses...) i also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the hst optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.) can the moveable optical components even be re-caged (i assume that they were caged for launch)? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- michael corvin 	 				zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com gn&c r&d					martin marietta astronautics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- =============== my views, not martin marietta's ======================== -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

biological alchemy ( another form of cold fusion ) ( alternative heavy element creation in universe ) a very simple experiment can demonstrate (prove) the fact of "biological transmutations" (reactions like mg + o --> ca, si + c --> ca, k + h --> ca, n2 --> co, etc.), as described in the book "biological transmutations" by louis kervran, [1972 edition is best.], and in chapter 17 of the book "the secret life of plants" by peter tompkins and christopher bird, 1973: (1) obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same kind. [some kinds might work better that others.] (2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) separately incinerate both groups. (5) weigh the residue from each group. [the residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least several percent more than the other group.] (6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content. [some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been transmuted into heavier mineral elements by fusing with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..] biological transmutations occur routinely, even in our own bodies. ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can speed healing of broken bones via the reaction si + c --> ca, (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). some mineral deposits in the ground are formed by micro- organisms fusing together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. the two reactions si + c <--> ca, by micro-organisms, cause "stone sickness" in statues, building bricks, etc.. the reaction n2 --> co, catalysed by very hot iron, creates a carbon-monoxide poison hazard for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). some bacteria can even neutralize radioactivity! all of these things and more happen, in spite of the currently accepted "laws" of physics, (including the law which says that atomic fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures.)

there are a number of philosophical questions that i would like to ask: 1) if we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it? 2) if we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will we expend resources from earth to help them? 3) with all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable, what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere? -- have a day, @ @ ( ) bobo

(hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as i am not a diving expert). mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th our earth's atmospheric density). in addition, the mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. basically, you would need a pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure. interesting huh? ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu

mars, the god of war; mercury, messenger of the gods; venus, the god of love and beauty, and saturn, father of jupiter and god of agriculture. the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky. science flourished during the european renaissance. fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated. in the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries. but the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth's gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets. the united states has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the moon. our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars; explored the sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past mercury, jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune. these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. through the electronic sight and other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered. future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century. automated spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration's (nasa's) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common. each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with earth. electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power. imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! to help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft. the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. just as earth's early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward earth. the thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory. between 1959 and 1971, nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than earth -- mercury, venus and mars. these three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition. for the early planetary reconnaissance missions, nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners. their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. between 1962 and 1975, seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space. all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies. although the mariners ranged from the mariner 2 venus spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the mariner 9 mars orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. the mariner 5 venus spacecraft, for example, had originally been a backup for the mariner 4 mars flyby. the mariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner 9 mars orbiter program. in 1972, nasa launched pioneer 10, a jupiter spacecraft. interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed. four nasa spacecraft in all -- two pioneers and two voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. because of the distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. because the sun's light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes. nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late 1970s. twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the mariner craft -- carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above. two drum-shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in 1978. the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to "see" through the planet's dense cloud cover to study surface features. the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. the probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface. a new generation of automated spacecraft -- including magellan, galileo, ulysses, mars observer, the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) and cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet. the sun a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun. the sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. this 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the sun's formation. one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the sun's disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million earths. as a star, the sun generates energy through the process of fusion. the temperature at the sun's core is 15 million degrees celsius (27 million degrees fahrenheit), and the pressure there is 340 billion times earth's air pressure at sea level. the sun's surface temperature of 5,500 degrees celsius (10,000 degrees fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. at the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing energy. the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets. the sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. at the end of its life, the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth. after a billion years as a "red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" -- the final end product of a star like ours. it may take a trillion years to cool off completely. many spacecraft have explored the sun's environment, but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from earth to the sun. pioneers 5-11, the pioneer venus orbiter, voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. the ulysses spacecraft, launched on october 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency. after using jupiter's gravity to change its trajectory, ulysses will fly over the sun's polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments. we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is. if it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly never have developed on earth. mercury obtaining the first close-up views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on november 3, 1973, from kennedy space center in florida. after a journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of venus, the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system's innermost planet on march 29, 1974. until mariner 10, little was known about mercury. even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. when the planet is visible on earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercury's surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner 10. the photographs mariner 10 radioed back to earth revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own moon. the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. these apparently were created when mercury's interior cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. the cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles). instruments on mariner 10 discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. when the planet's orbit takes it closest to the sun, surface temperatures range from 467 degrees celsius (872 degrees fahrenheit) on mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees celsius (-298 degrees fahrenheit) on the dark side. this range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees celsius (1,170 degrees fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time. days and nights are long on mercury. the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 earth days) and a rapid revolution around the sun (88 earth days) means that one mercury solar day takes 176 earth days or two mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun! mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth. scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. that would make mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the moon's core or those of any of the planets. after the initial mercury encounter, mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on september 21, 1974, and march 16, 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the planet's surface. venus veiled by dense cloud cover, venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. the mariner 2 spacecraft, launched on august 27, 1962, was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus, plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus' surface, romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest. on december 14, 1962, mariner 2 passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured venus for 42 minutes. mariner 5, launched in june 1967, flew much closer to the planet. passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) of venus on the second american flyby, mariner 5's instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts and temperatures. on its way to mercury, mariner 10 flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere. in the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus. on december 4 of the same year, the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet. five days later, the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the pioneer venus multiprobe -- entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. the four small, independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface. although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour. venus resembles earth in size, physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. however, spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. for example, venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of earth and most of the other planets. approximately 96.5 percent of venus' atmosphere (95 times as dense as earth's) is carbon dioxide. the principal constituent of earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. venus' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. as a result, the planet's average surface temperature is 482 degrees celsius (900 degrees fahrenheit), hot enough to melt lead. a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. nasa's magellan spacecraft, launched on may 5, 1989, has been in orbit around venus since august 10, 1990. the spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface. magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, faults and impact craters. huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the united states. at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes, a mountain the size of mount everest. scarring the mountain's flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named cleopatra. (almost all features on venus are named for women; maxwell montes, alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions.) craters survive on venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion. extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth. but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california. venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude, high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. at speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour, the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days. the circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as venus' slow rotation of 243 earth days, whereas earth's winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather. earth as viewed from space, our world's distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds. we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life, earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus. our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars. earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. along with the other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system. from our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. the first american satellite -- explorer 1 -- was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the van allen radiation belts, surrounding earth. since then, other research satellites have revealed that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun. we've learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth. besides affecting earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights. satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earth's complex weather systems. from their unique vantage points, satellites can survey earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's health. these eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways. the moon the moon is earth's single natural satellite. the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless companion. in preparation for the human-crewed apollo expeditions, nasa dispatched the automated ranger, surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968. nasa's apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples. from this material and other studies, scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy. rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. the first few million years of the moon's existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock, the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware, and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across. this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. then, for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the moon. the lava gradually spread out over the surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei, an astronomer of the italian renaissance, called maria, meaning seas. as far as we can tell, there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years. since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the sun and stars, by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear. the origin of the moon is still a mystery. four theories attempt an explanation: the moon formed near earth as a separate body; it was torn from earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars. the last theory has some good support but is far from certain. mars of all the planets, mars has long been considered the solar system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. these observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. in 1938, when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds by h.g. wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic. another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's surface. this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods. so far, six american missions to mars have been carried out. four mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived. mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past mars on july 14, 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the surface. transmitting to earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide. on may 30, 1971, the mariner 9 orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to find mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. but after the storm cleared, mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains. in august and september 1975, the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from kennedy space center. the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet, including, is there life there? nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present. viking lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july 20, 1976, while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial. photos sent back from the chryse planitia ("plains of gold") showed a bleak, rusty-red landscape. panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. when viking lander 2 touched down on utopia planitia on september 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes. the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive. small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil chemistry. is there life on mars? no one knows for sure, but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there. the viking landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. few weather changes were observed. the highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees celsius (7 degrees fahrenheit) at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer. the lowest temperature, -120 degrees celsius (-184 degrees fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly viking lander 2 site during winter. near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. viking lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet. the martian atmosphere, like that of venus, is primarily carbon dioxide. nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys. there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet. mars has two moons, phobos and deimos. they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity. the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. the first to fail was viking orbiter 2, which stopped operating on july 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. viking lander 2 operated until april 12, 1980, when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. viking orbiter 1 quit on august 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. viking lander 1 ceased functioning on november 13, 1983. despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments, we know more about mars than any other planet except earth. nasa's mars observer spacecraft, to be launched in september 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. asteroids the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. most, but not all, are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter. some have orbits that cross earth's path, and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. one of the least eroded, best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow, arizona. asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. more likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. in fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object, the object would be only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our moon. thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth. it is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earth-based telescopes. much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth. asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids. when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. if the meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes earth's surface and is called a meteorite. one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica. of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks. since asteroids are material from the very early solar system, scientists are interested in their composition. spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances. current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. the galileo orbiter, launched by nasa in october 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to jupiter. the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) and cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa, the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy, as well as the united states air force and the department of energy. one day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials. jupiter beyond mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of our solar system, lie the giant planets of jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune. in 1972, nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. jupiter was the first port of call. pioneer 10, which lifted off from kennedy space center in march 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. in december 1973, it returned the first close-up images of jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's banded cloud tops. pioneer 11 followed a year later. voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979. these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds. sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiter's atmosphere. it is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. because of jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived. the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth. this hurricane-like storm in jupiter's atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. as a high-pressure region, the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. the great red spot might be a million years old. our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter's upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth's northern lights at the jovian polar regions. voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling jupiter. largest of the solar system's planets, jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. the massive planet takes almost 12 earth years to complete a journey around the sun. with 16 known moons, jupiter is something of a miniature solar system. a new mission to jupiter -- the galileo project -- is under way. after a six- year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus, twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to earth. the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed. galilean satellites in 1610, galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. for the first time, humans had seen the moons of another world. in honor of their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons. but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites. one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io. volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth. the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io, with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface. io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between io, jupiter and the other three galilean moons. europa, approximately the same size as our moon, is the brightest galilean satellite. the moon's surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been fractured. caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like io, europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. europa's core is made of rock that sank to its center. like europa, the other two galilean moons -- ganymede and callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets mercury and pluto. the satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. ganymede's surface has areas of different brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface. callisto, only slightly smaller than ganymede, has the lowest density of any galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts. detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter. saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn. its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. like jupiter, saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds, saturn's atmosphere has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. given saturn's somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) per hour. three american spacecraft have visited saturn. pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon titan in september 1979, returning the first close-up images. voyager 1 followed in november 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturn's ring system and moons. voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in august 1981. the rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around saturn's equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock. the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn. the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturn's gravity. a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet. unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites. these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings. radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft. these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturn's ring system rather than its atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. as they had at jupiter, the voyagers saw a version of earth's auroras near saturn's poles. the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining saturn's rings and the gaps in the rings. saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by voyager 2 in 1981. voyager 1 determined that titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like earth's in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus. titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees celsius (-290 degrees fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. unfortunately, voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's dense clouds. continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. the latter compound is a building block of amino acids. these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago. however, titan's atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry. the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission. the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens, which will be dropped into titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titan's clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system. uranus in january 1986, four and a half years after visiting saturn, voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the uranian system. the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet's discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel. uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the solar system. unlike the other planets (with the exception of pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. during voyager 2's flyby, the south pole faced the sun. uranus might have been knocked over when an earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system. voyager 2 found that uranus' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. instead, the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's center, a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta, on the island of java in indonesia. uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water vapor. the planet's blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees celsius (-366 degrees fahrenheit). uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene, ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. surrounding the planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow." approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below uranus' cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. beneath this ocean is an earth-sized core of heavier materials. voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter, orbiting uranus. the five previously known -- miranda, ariel, umbriel, titania and oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. representing a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity, including faulting and ice flows. the most remarkable of uranus' moons is miranda. its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. the sharp variations in terrain suggest that, after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface. uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; voyager 2 imaged 11. in contrast to saturn's rings, which are composed of bright particles, uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark, boulder-sized chunks. neptune voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet's moons. on august 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton. during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's atmosphere was more active than uranus'. voyager 2 observed the great dark spot, a circular storm the size of earth, in neptune's atmosphere. resembling jupiter's great red spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the "scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per hour. like the other giant planets, neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. the planet's core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane. neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's spin axis and is not centered at the core. this phenomenon is similar to uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores, where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. earth's magnetic field, on the other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center. voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptune's rings. observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even, unclumped rings. voyager 2 detected these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings. a number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies were not spotted. astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949. voyager 2 found six more. one of the new moons -- proteus -- is actually larger than nereid, but since proteus orbits close to neptune, it was lost in the planet's glare for observers on earth. triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. in 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet's modest current rings. triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda. the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus. triton's mantle is probably composed of water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding ice cap. dark streaks appear on the ice cap. these streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as thick as earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees celsius, -391 degrees fahrenheit). triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited. pluto pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999. pluto's orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets. discovered in 1930, pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. the planet's diameter is calculated to be approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the size of our moon. ground-based observations indicate that pluto's surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun. observations also show that pluto's spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees. the planet has one known satellite, charon, discovered in 1978. charon's surface composition is different from pluto's: the moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto, so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. pluto's and charon's rotational period and charon's period of revolution are all 6.4 earth days. although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto, nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission. comets the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun. most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud, a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star. comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun. as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets, these volatile elements are boiling. the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets. as these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma or cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun. the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet's "tails." gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly. as the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc. both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun; in effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun. the tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length, but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. comets -- from the latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentially dramatic light shows. some comets pass through the solar system only once, but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system. halley's comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus' orbit. confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 b.c. this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley, because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return, based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion. his name became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet returned on schedule. unfortunately, sir edmond did not live to see it. a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth. unfortunately, on its most recent appearance, halley's comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. the comet was visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. comets have been so bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky. the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun. craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was nasa's international cometary explorer in 1985. an armada of five spacecraft (two japanese, two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency) flew by halley's comet in 1986. conclusion despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- earth. but since 1959, spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space. we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects. the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. by studying the geology of planets, moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole. we are also gaining insight into earth's complex weather systems. by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the sun's activity and its influence throughout the solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth. we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. one current mission is mapping venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. future missions are planned for mars, saturn, a comet and the asteroid belt. we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december 1972, plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts. one day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony! - end -

idea for repair of satellites: warning i am getting creative again: why not build a inflatable space dock. basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure, saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it.. the inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat), thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped down own).. i know this might take a slot of work or not??? or just to plain wierd, but ideas need to be thought of, for where is tomorrow, but in the imagination of the present.. == michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i'm not high, just jacked

i feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to batse press releases. the idea behind the statement is as follows: "if you smack two neutron stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole, a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance. but, so the reasoning continues, this energy is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum. the observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must be wrong." as so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. it may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. when this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. all this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by martin rees, peter meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. it is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by stan woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. if the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. the rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario. on another note: i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so. ralph wijers

people who criticize "big government" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of government in science and technology. basically, the u.s. government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term. (historically, this role for the u.s. gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries. in order for u.s. industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the u.s. gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead r&d.) as a republican, i abhor the necessity for our government to involve itself in technology this way. i believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it. but the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized r&d, while others would not. so the u.s. must subsidize because everybody else does. (this sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our gatt negotiations, doesn't it?) but this role of government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness. the general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of u.s. industry to invest in new technology. and since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money. of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but everybody disagrees about that the wisdom should be. it's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from government projects. gantt charts, cp/m, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from dod projects and their contractors. the construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools. -- ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 "a scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one. he would have to ask an engineer to do that." -- gordon l. glegg, american engineer, 1969

(a small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.) thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed. moreover, the iras observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns. grains colder than 30 k will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and iras would be relatively insensitive to them. in the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation. worse still, iras color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of "small" grains. these grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 k. of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred k. even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed "average" temperature. a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data has three components. these represent scattered radiation from zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 k), thermal emission from zodiacal dust (tc = 280 k), and thermal emission from galactic dust (tc=25 k). at the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9e-13, 4e-8, and 2e-5. the first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane. to find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root. in the table below, starlight comes from allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with b-v color of 0.75. no doubt careful work could do much better. (the person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of e-4 must have been remembering wrong. we would be cooked if that were the case. in any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and i believe that to be correct.) dilution temp. dt^4 microwave background 1 2.7 53 galactic dust 2e-5 25 8 zodiacal dust (emission) 6e-8 280 369 zodiacal dust (scattering) 3e-13 5500 275 starlight 1e-13 5500 92 ----- 797 the fourth root of 797 is 5.3 k. outside the solar system, the result would be 3.5 k. i find these results surprising, especially the importance of zodiacal dust, but i don't see any serious mistakes. -- steve willner phone 617-495-7123 bitnet: willner@cfa cambridge, ma 02138 usa internet: willner@cfa.harvard.edu member, league for programming freedom; contact lpf@uunet.uu.net

we are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform. this will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the march 29 flight of seds (small expendable deployment system), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of mexico. this time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. we want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible. we want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute. an idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with sarsats (search and rescue satellites). it would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking. these beacons are known in the marine industry as epirbs (emergency position indicating radio beacon). they are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap. we have several questions: 1. what is the world authority regulating the use of sarsat beacons. are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian? 2. what are the regulations regarding the use of sarsat signals. can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies? 3. what is the coverage of sarsats? are they in leo with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit? 4. is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders? please post replies here or send e-mail to me at: 	fennell@well.sf.ca.us thanak you very much for any assistance you can provide. 			-mike fennell

teflon? a contribution from the space program? since the french were using teflon on household items in the early 1950's, it is unlikely that it was invented by nasa. as for pacemakers and calculators, again those are anecdotally connected with nasa. --- maximus 2.01wb

i just wanted to point out, that teflon wasn't from the space program. it was from the wwii nuclear weapons development program. pipes in the system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it. uranium hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for enrichment. it is massively corrosive. even to stainless steels. hence the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with. teflon has all its molecular sockets bound up already, so it is very unreactive. my 2 sense worth. bill

forwarded from the mars observer project mars observer status report april 30, 1993 11:30 am pdt dss-65 (madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected mars observer spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29) at approximately 6:00 am. indications were that the spacecraft had entered a fault protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (dss-15 - goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 pm the evening before. entry into contingency mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning. after subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system audit queue and aacs (attitude and articulation control subsystem) starex performed. these readouts verified that contingency mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 am yesterday, 4/29/93. preliminary indications are that a sun ephemeris check failure triggered fault protection. however, the flight team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days. as of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to inertial reference and was stable in that mode. the flight team is planning to command the spacecraft back to array normal spin state today. magnetometer calibration activities had completed prior to contingency mode entry. mag calibration data has been recorded on digital tape recorders 2 and 3. playback of dtrs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed yesterday, was postponed when contingency mode entry halted flight sequence c9 execution. the flight team is developing a strategy to restart c9 to complete data playback. present planning is to perform playbacks between as soon as wednesday, or as late as friday of next week (5/5- 5/7), dependent on contingency mode recovery activity. dtr playback will be performed via the high gain antenna at 42,667 bits per second. upon verification of successful dtr playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4k s & e rate. ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| ron baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | jet propulsion lab | ___| | | | |__) |/ | | |__ m/s 525-3684 telos | the aweto from new zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| pasadena, ca 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable.

picture our universe floating like a log in a river. as the log floats down the river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the bank, the bottom, other logs. when this collission occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy translaions occur. the distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log. however, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction. this is my theory for grb. they are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes! why not! makes just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud! the log theory of universes can't be ruled out! of course, i'm a layman in the physics world. you physicists out there, tell me about this !!!! bob combs astronautical engineer, stanford telecom .

getting wierd again? okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto is to large and to expensive.. okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. kind of liek the old mirv principle of old cold war days. basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missions,namely different planets. each probe would be tied in with the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. this is good when and if we go for mars (the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the probes. also the mother ship would be powered (if not the mars mission) by a normal propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they needed.. i know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a sail?? main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut costs.. the probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see... == michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i'm not high, just jacked

"mothership" except for voyager style flyby missions. a few years ago, i did some calculations on a "grand tour" space probe launched by a saturn v in 1975-76. at the time,i felt that the idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak titan iii/centaur launchers. the concept i examined (and michael's?) had a lot in common with the british interplanetary society's daedalus project for sending a probe to barnard's star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. the saturn v supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards jupiter and beyond. the "bus" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. extremely important as the voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- the smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. the advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic jupiter-saturn-uranus-neptune mission than voyager 2 did, but in addition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to pluto. this would have enabled nasa to map both hemispheres of pluto/charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the jupiter/saturn/uranus/neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. a small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, well-equipped spacecraft. and would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! the reason why the grand tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course. marcu$ > == > michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i'm not high, just jacked >

(looking at the elements for c1833 also shows the limitations of norad's software -- but that's another story.) this probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 degree orbits of the c1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for manned platforms. but it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the situation.

(-: dc-x is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental "x-plane" hardware. it's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks. i would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s america, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the dc-y. i'm sure you know well that launch costs are the basic problem for any expansion of astronautics. i don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else. if the dc flops, it'll be business as usual in space. the nineties and the double-oughts will look just like the seventies and eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear. (pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction. it doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks. it's creating its own market for small payloads.) i read the magazines and i've attended the last two iafs. there are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than ssto. there is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line. >you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the following: [...deleting some things i'm not going to prove tonight...] >3 that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable >dc-x successor strawman. is anybody seriously proposing this? references, please. the dc must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a nasa ferociously committed to continuing shuttle operations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your common sense tells you. if dc-y flies at all, it flies alongside the shuttle, not instead of it. also, of course, dc-y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated. >4 most importantly, that the dc-x will open up leo to more scientific and >technical payloads. if a dc-x successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1m, or even $5m, rather than the $40m it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one. big outfits can fly multi-satellite series. little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride. this is just supply and demand. you should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming dc makes a big difference in costs. do you have some reason to think not? o~~* /_) ' / / /_/ ' , , ' ,_ _ \|/ - ~ -~~~~~~~~~~~/_) / / / / / / (_) (_) / / / _\~~~~~~~~~~~zap! / \ (_) (_) / | \ | | bill higgins fermi national accelerator laboratory \ / bitnet: higgins@fnal.bitnet - - internet: higgins@fnal.fnal.gov ~ span/hepnet: 43011::higgins

pennicillin if i have everything correct, was a highly valuable myco-toxin, discovered during ww2. it proved to have an amazing bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity. it's immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal. although initially enormously expensive to culture, within 3 years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within 10 years, was not much more expensive then aspirin. penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections. centoxin is a drug that is not passing fda approval. it promised amazing results for toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease. it consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement, however it works less then 1 in 5 times of administration and costs $2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. the drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case, and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients. i would not dare to compare the shuttle to pennicillin, but to centoxin. pat

it is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some believe that poor old new mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business. for many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not. the 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of new mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port. the commanding general at wsmr is in full support of dual-use for the facilities. the wsmr location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project. just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don't think that nothing has happened. from my interactions with the macdac folks, i get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar. i believe that all will happen this summer and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. stephen horan shoran@nmsu.edu

in some sense, i think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful, and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right. that is, i think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone wants to try it out, more power to them. however, a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would gain might decide to bow out of the project. i got incensed when i read that carl sagan called this idea an "abomination." i don't think that word means what he thinks it does. children starving in the richest country in the world is an abomination; an ad agency is at worst just in poor taste. tom courtney

i don't think so. if you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. i think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. i don't know much about panda "thumbs", so i'll ask is it opposable?

> >[*yes, i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far >space aliens are also mythical.] well i won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but i'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i don't think it's likely. first let me say that when i say "intelligent" i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. that's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien. now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. there's room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. one reason this may be true is neuronic speed. the electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate. this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. so there's little selection pressure for such brains. instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. this doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction. then there are the thermodynamic arguments. a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. i contend that a creature that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. that argument may be somewhat weak. the dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. i'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. but for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. ie monkey curiousity. i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity. gary -- gary coffman ke4zv | you make it, | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary destructive testing systems | we break it. | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary 534 shannon way | guaranteed! | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary lawrenceville, ga 30244 | |

we`ve had the the great western, the [ dunno ] and the great northern postulated as brunel`s masterpiece. keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually. the great western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. the great eastern, which broke the 'little giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. a thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling. unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. as another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. it was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. see arthur c clarke`s book "how the world was one" [ i think that`s right ] if that`s how the shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely ignoble, but i doubt if history will be so charitable. its true the shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they worth doing? with low cost access to space, you could have an affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned missions. as it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a space-rv, ( only not so cheap to run :-( ) -- __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| peter card, joint european torus, abingdon | | | |_. | | | oxfordshire ox14 3ea uk. tel 0235-464867 fax 464404 | | | _| | | | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366 ._| | | |_. | | | it wasnt me. it was the others. they made me do it. --`--~'-+---+-+-+----+------------------------------------------------------- - disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the jet project.

hello netters, i'm new to this board and i thought this might be the best place for my post. i have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie patriot games. in the movies, the cia utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in n africa. the photos taken by the sats are stunning! i know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles. my question is this: the camp in question was taken out by the british sas. and while the sas was in action, the cia team was watching in the warroom back in langley, va. the action of the sas was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat. the action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type. that is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp. does such techology exist and what is it's nature? i.e., uv, ir, x-ray, etc. ps who wrote the book patriot games? mad vlad
