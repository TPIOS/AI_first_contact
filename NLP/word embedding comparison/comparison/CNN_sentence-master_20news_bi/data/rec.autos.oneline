thanks to all of you who responded to my posting. the problem with my truck's headlights low beam problem was a "loose wire connection". it was not the "fuse" as a minority of you suggested. thanks again.
the subject says it all. my 1984 chev s10 pickup's left turn signal does not stop after turning. what cause this to stop automaticaly?. is this a mechanical problem by the steering wheel?. note: this truck has an after market steering wheel (gt-grant) installed.

i am thinking about getting an infiniti g20. in consumer reports it is ranked high in many catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars. mitsubushi galant was second followed by honda accord). a couple of things though: 1) in looking around i have yet to see anyone driving this car. i see lots of honda's and toyota's. 2) there is a special deal where i can get an infinity g20, fully loaded, at dealer cost (i have check this out and the numbers match up). they are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993 version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's. i guess my question is: is this a good deal? also, can anyone give me any feedback on infiniti? thanks, carl hoffman p.s. the other cars that i have test driven and which are in the running are: mitsubishi galant, honda accord, and toyota camary

this past winter i drove from nyc to killington,vt 6 or 7 times in my 1990 325i convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!) with an excellent set of snow tires. i put 4 noika nr10s on in dec. and have been sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. i've plowed through 4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed (front wheel drive included). concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars in snowy conditions. drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform adequately in less than ideal conditions. an aside: i can't praise noika nr10 snows enough. absolutely the best snow tires i have ever driven on. if you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these next winter. tim --- timothy j. bigham			| all opinions expressed above are my own lehman brothers, inc.			| and should not be construed as those of amex tower, world financial center	| my employer. new york, n.y. 				|

one of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 probe gt on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the window saying the dealership bought the car back from the previous owner because of "engine noises", but that the ford district rep had ok'ed the car saying those noises were "normal". i thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 probe gt, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said "was something with the heads", that ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet. her son traded the car in (and i checked -- not the same car). so i have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the v6 in the probe gt's, and by extension with the madza 626 and mx-6. anything to this? i'd love to consider buying the gt (i'm turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but i'd hate to find out i just became the proud owner of a lemon.

left hand steering wheel placement was not standard until the 20's in the us. driving on the right has been standard since standards came into being. interestingly, chrysler has just begun building right hand drive cars again for export to japan.
desoto's first year of manufacture was 1928, so this may indeed have been an export special, as left hand controls were standard here by then.

hello testing
my friend brought a subaru svx recently. i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car, esp on snow. however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars. the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour. at first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price. so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem ? and if the oil change story is true, then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me. by the way, the car looks great. swd wan.
could someone out there please tell me how i could get onto the saab mailing list. specifically i need the address and instructions on what to do. thanks in advance pete

in article <foo> brad thone <c09615bt@wuvmd> writes: well, there *is* a difference. i don't happen to have my sae manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature. the sae numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0c, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 5-weight at 20c, for a typical 40-weight oil. oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification. oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `w' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10w in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year. modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. as a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves. a multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though i can't remember the numbers...). in any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference. remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something. any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil. thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20w50) will lubricate better at temperature, but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs. if you're planning on making long drives, the 20w50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10w40 car. but if you're making short drives, stick to the 10w40. -- don't drink soap! dilute dilute! ok!

i bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts for my old but still running version of the same car. the car i bought has good tires. is there anything in particular that i should do to store the defunct car long-term? i'd hate to have parts of it go bad. someone has told me it's bad for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while. is this true? do i need some props to take the weight of the tires? best to reply by mail, i am getting spotty news delivery. kris a. kugel	908-842-2707 hico2!kak	kak@hico2.westmark.com

i know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share. the story is this: i bought a car out of state, and i'm trying to get the safety inspection in pennsylvania. the problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. the tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint. the inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless i get a waiver from the state police. so i went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and i can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. i asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal. he showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. when i told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said "it's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now." well, won't argue with that... since the vehicle code says it's ok as long as you can see through the tint, i'd like to keep it (i'll re-read the vehicle code in the library). i'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's ok, so i can get the inspection, and so that i won't get in trouble for the tint later on. i also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off. so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in pennsylvania? does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? i called the station later on today, but they basically said there is no place where i could register a complaint against an officer... and if i do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do i stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court? any comments about it will be welcome! michal

a while back i asked for help in defending a traffic ticket i received. in short: the ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. given the conditions i could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the intersection, i would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident. a police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left and gave me the ticket. the officer said "the only reason that you even slowed down in the first place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right through" i would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for help. to all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine: phghghghgh.. the judge sided with me and decided that in this case "not stopping" was the safest thing to do and found me not guilty. the officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made the judge decide on his verdict. moral: if you have never been to court before and you think you have a case, 	 go for it. it is a very interesting process, and it is there for 	 your benefit. exercise your rights. trev -- name : trevor paquette | landmark/ita | _\___ fahrvergnuegen email: tpaquette@ita.lgc.com | calgary, alberta, canada | / \____ visitor from cyberspace | (403) 269-4669 |/ g60 \ renegade of virtual reality | #include <disclaimer.h> |\-o------o--/
i had exactly the same problem with a 1981 horizon. third gear would just disengage. engine would rev up. kind of disconcerting. i sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny sticks with me. it also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer could not fix. if the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered. i have had several jap cars since then (figuring the horizon was my contribution to the american auto companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a toyota tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try. anyway, from that day forward, i have sworn that i would never purchase another american car with a standard. american manufacturers don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars. however, i hate automatics, so i am still buying jap cars. not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too. cheers, larry -- @@ larry rogers * @@@ larry_rogers@dg.com * big brother @@@ &&& larry@boris.webo.dg.com * is watching @@ && data general 508-870-8441 * the opinions contained herein are my own, and do not reflect the opinions of data general or anyone else, but they should.

i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer. the design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an eeprom. the idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom. the secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used. the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 mph so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. this was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 mph in operation. the case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 rx-7! the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated. since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car. i am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ecm. while it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. i personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

howdy, i'm a little new to this newsgroup, but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here. the subject: after-market cruise controls the background: i recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five screws, yuk! :-( ). in two weeks i will be returning to texas (my home) from my school (byu) in provo, utah. as you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time. my car does not have a cruise control, so i would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle. my question: what is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units? i realize that a cheap cc (cruise control) from, say, pep boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing). and i uderstand that i probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing; but anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle. i have a 1984 jeep cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5l engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic. maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but i'm just trying to give information as completly as i can). i found a cc unit for 80 bucks. it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor/motor. is this good or bad? if i did buy this cc, which vacuum hose should i tap? it has two speed sensors: one magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so i understand. i can use either one. which is best? the manual says (i read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install. is there really a big difference? it has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other ccs, but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal. so if i wasn't paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up. which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off. i'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but i'm ok with it. the installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal. i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse. am i right? but i'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is? any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it? i think i can figure the other things out. like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business. but i need a little help with: 	1. is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a 	 device? 	2. is there any particularly good after-market cc? 	3. are "professionally" installed ccs signifacantly better and 	 worth the cabbage? 	4. if the unit i saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just 	 that it is at pep boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple 	 needs, how do i get the thing installed properly (specifically, 	 the questions above)? my father and i built a "veep" (volkswagen powered jeep cj-2a) when i was in high school, so i consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars. so the installation doesn't scare me. i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep. :-) i appreciate your time in reading my post, and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject. if you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as i don't get over this group very often (but i check my mail all the time). again, thanks for any help anyone may have. mike wieda mikew@canc.byu.edu
rob reilly: >whips and their tempers. initially, all cars were built with the driver's >controls on the right because that's the way people drove buggies, so the this is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering controls in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible pattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into the 20th century, when, in america at least, left-hand wheels became the pattern. the mule team (or horses, i imagine) explanation, however, seems to have some merit. dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu carnegie mellon university applied history "this coffee plunges into the stomach...the mind is aroused, and ideas pour forth like the battalions of the grand army on the field of battle.... memories charge at full gallop...the light cavalry of comparisons deploys itself magnificently; the artillery of logic hurry in with their train of ammunition; flashes of wit pop up like sharp-shooters." honore de balzac, 30 cups/day.

i have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. it's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor. he said, it is to be changed every 30k, but since i bought the car when it had 77k, i don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k. he quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. the part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything. if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed. also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. also, what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. any help would be greatly apprecisted thanks nagesh

archive-name: rec-autos/part1 [most recent changes, 15 march 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw] === welcome to rec.autos.* === this article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions. the keywords `monthly posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities. this article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos. if you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation. failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there. introduction to the rec.autos newsgroup hierarchy: rec.autos.tech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service. other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially for sale ads. rec.autos.sport is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles. technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles. discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged. arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions. for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law. (remember, the fbi reads usenet!) rec.autos.driving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here. rec.autos.vw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen (this includes vws, audis, seats, etc.) it was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful. it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list. rec.audio.car is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy. it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here. rec.autos.antique is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.) alt.hotrod is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader. it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles. alt.autos.rod-n-custom also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars. alt.autos.karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting. rec.autos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics. crossposting: crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed. crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet. you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience. this distinction is subtle, but important. radar detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos. they are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is not adequate justification for posting to either group. crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article. consider setting followup-to: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost. crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us and/or the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups. most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos. it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups: and followup-to: lines of articles before posting a followup. in particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three. the life you save may be your own. distribution: there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the distribution field. it may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system. the distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive. as of this writing, the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe, australia, new zealand, and some locations in japan. with this in mind, i offer the following hints about use of the distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content. 1) please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes mavericks (but only 4-door mavericks, at that.) 2) when posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured. for example, there are a number of differences between a european-market ford escort and a us-market escort. likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection; european market cars usually got carbs (often webers). these differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation. 3) be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values, whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system. a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it. 4) use the distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible. within north america, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used. in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey, i could put "ny,nj" in a distribution field. note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal. these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area. the dangers of overgeneralization: to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc. what is true for a 1973 buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 honda with a 1200cc engine. headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho. the need for adequate specification: when you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc. otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless. concerning lemons: at one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even honda admits to this. please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company. such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information. concerning flames: as much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur. here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting): if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `no flames' will work. it won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve. if you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference. no one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions. be careful about who you choose to insult. consider not insulting anyone. asking the question: it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `please send email, i don't read this group'. it is a much better idea to end the question with `please send email, if there is sufficient interest i'll summarize the results in a later posting. i may miss posted responses to this request'. answering the question: if someone wants to hop up their yugo, don't tell them to get a mustang. either be silent, or give them useful advice. if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question. in general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous. stale and/or inflammatory topics: certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether. some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them. some of these topics include the following: 1) the 55mph speed limit in the us: pro and con 2) discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors. 3) discussions over which radar detector is best. 4) discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue about what constitutes a `sports car'.) 5) disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the driver's right to own and operate a radar detector 6) `buy american' discussions 7) `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates 8) <insert nationality here> cars are terrible 9) what kind of car did maxwell smart drive?

archive-name: rec-autos/part5 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers. -- rpw] [changes as of 14 april 1993: revised brake fluid section, as non-silicone dot-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw] commonly asked automotive questions tire questions: q: what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean? a: typically, you will see something like 195/60hr14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. the 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. the 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `trx' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. the r means radial, and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. common speed ratings are s (112mph), t (118mph), h (130mph), and v (up to 150mph.) recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60r14 85h; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. what follows is a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 max load (kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. in some cases, the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size; the lt designation indicates light truck, and the p designation indicates passenger car. if no letter is given, then the application of the tire is passenger car usage. as far as i know, these letters only appear in the us market. the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. for the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all. if the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. tires with an ms (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. temperature and traction are graded a, b, and c (with a the best and c the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. these values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. q: my car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65hr390; can i put normal tires on the car? a: your tires are called trx tires; they were devised by michelin. because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels.) you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) trx type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to michelin, avon makes suitable tires. goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires. q: can i rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? a: car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes michelin and goodyear); others (for example, pirelli and nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. q: how many snow tires should i buy, and if i buy 2, which end of the car should i put them on? a: in short, 4, and both ends. to explain, many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. with a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) in a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. radar detectors and speed limits: q: why aren't there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this q&a posting? a: because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless flame wars. if you want to talk about either of these topics, please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. safety equipment: q: do airbags really work? a: preliminary statistics suggest the following: airbags work much better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than airbags alone, and airbags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone. the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. brake questions: q: do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? midas always wants to do this. a: no. there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or to turn them. note also that some rotors (the rotors on many hondas are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, or badly grooved. q: they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down. is this really a good idea? a: it used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade prone drum brakes. in modern disc brake equipped cars, use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases of long, steep downhill runs. otherwise, modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. on the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; i suggest that before taking a us driver's test, you either 1) learn to do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test. q: how often should i replace my brake fluid? a: probably more often than you do. traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. dot-3 type are older fluids; dot-4 and dot-5 are newer specifications. the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid. dot-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; dot-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements; and dot-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements (but dot-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see the next q&a for more details.) while the requirements imply that dot-4 fluids are better than dot-3 fluids, there may be specific cases where a dot-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly competition applications. otherwise, dot-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel. replacement once a year is recommended for dot-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. q: what about dot-5 brake fluids? a: this breaks down in to two parts. the dot-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first dot-5 fluids were silicone based. silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. unlike dot-3 and dot-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. while this may sound like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids. two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot-4 fluids, they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot-4 fluids. silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications, but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications, and the economics are questionable for street use. i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot-5 standard that do not contain silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot-3 and dot-4 fluids, but i have little information at this time. q: abs is available on some of the cars i'm looking at, but it costs more. is it worth it? a: this does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. the short answer is that abs costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. now for the long answer. abs works by monitering the wheels of the car, looking for signs of locked brakes. it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several systems on the market.) it cannot detect impending lockup (which is what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence of lockup. the sensors used vary; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oe-equivalent components. when the sensors detect lockup, the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the system.) if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is achieved.) this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as the system cycles. the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an abs system this is about 40% on dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time. unfortunately, on mud and on snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked; only audi, of the manufacturers producing abs-equipped cars, has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality. a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control. this is the case simply because, if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the abs will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. braking distances will lengthen accordingly. an important caution: abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on glare ice, don't expect an abs system to help you out very much. the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car. as far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential restrictions i've listed above, you have to worry about the following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the oe master cylinder for the abs-equipped version of the same car lists for over $1000. most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot-5 (silicone) brake fluids in abs-equipped vehicles. because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components, regular (i suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important. q: what about this threshold braking business? a: [normally, i'd not put this in the consumers q&a, but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in abs-equipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw] threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much to be prefered. basically, the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but just before the wheels lock up entirely. drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal. in many cars, you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. in any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're not very near the threshold. in a car with abs, often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over. recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with abs systems. the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems, but according to autoweek magazine, it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training. there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. if you think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an abs system by that much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient. gas questions: q: does high octane gasoline help? a: maybe, maybe not. some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. on most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well. check your owner's manual for details on what your car needs. q: my car was made for leaded gasoline. will unleaded gas hurt it? a: it is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, although the amoco oil company argues otherwise. the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead. you should, however, check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline. q: do fuel treatments help? what kind should i use? a: some do and some don't. during the winter, it is a good idea to use dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. never use an additive containing methanol (sometimes called methyl alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing ethanol (sometimes called ethyl alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's manual on your car before using these. most manufacturers consider 10% ethanol acceptable in gasoline. additives with isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol), and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars. an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job. some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank. there are a small number of particularly good additives; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work much, much better. among these are chevron techron, redline sl-1, wurth `lubrimoly ventil sauber', and bg 44k. a bottle of one of these, once every six months, is highly recommended. q: what about detergent gasolines? a: the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; bmw has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact. stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. if such gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. lubrication questions: q: what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? a: there are several different items encoded. there is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	 uses in the oil; this looks like se,sf,cd or such. the s codes are for gasoline engine applications; the c codes are for diesel engine applications. the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed; thus sf is considered better than se, se is considered better than sd, and so forth. the more noticeable designation is the oil weight. this is either a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w (e.g., 10w30.) the latter type is much more commonly used these days, and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals. the first number in the designation (10w) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; the w stands for `winter'. the second number (30) is the viscosity of the oil when hot. there is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast as a 10w oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not all 10w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx, 10w40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10w30, 15w40, and 20w50 oils work very well, though. q: are `quick lube' places any good? a: some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there. let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on your wallet at all times. q: are oil additives like slick-50 or tufoil any good? a: slick-50 and tufoil are ptfe-based additives. many of these have come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50's. ptfe is the chemical name for teflon(tm), a trademark owned by dupont. in general, auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight increase of mpg after application, smoother revving) but long term results (whether ptfe additives are effective after 5k miles) are debatable. some manufacturers (such as saab) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick 50 to their cars. this writer has been cautioned by a slick-50 dealer (!) that slick-50 should _not_ be used in japanese motors, as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. otherwise, there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives. on the other hand, there are satified slick 50 customers in the world. q: do synthetic oils really work? a: yes, but. more specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers. auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car. even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils. synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely; amsoil, redline, and agip are very highly regarded and very effective. mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. q: manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. how often should i change my oil? a: it depends on how you drive. if your car always (or nearly always) gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine. if, however, you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) if you don't drive your car much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway. if you are storing a car during the winter, then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage. misc. questions: q: my car has a timing belt. i hear that bad things happen when they break. what's the story? a: it depends on the internal design of the motor. early ford escorts, for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. some honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. if no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent replacement. ask your dealer or independent mechanic. also, ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time (for example, the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect. replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake.) q: why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks? a: for performance reasons. compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles. q: what causes unintended acceleration? a: the final report of the national highway, transportation, and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence. the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator is probably the cause. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- carroll smith
unfortunately, i've got another story to add to this. my girlfriend and i were driving through west l.a., and got pelted by a rock just as we were pulling away from a stoplight. the scary thing was that the rock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72 riviera which is pretty much solid "detriot iron." couple of inches higher and it would have gone through the window. chris -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- chris barrus --- chrisb@lynx.ps.uci.edu --- kallista@aol.com 1972 buick riviera boattail, peace through superior automotive power! sacred cows make the best hamburger - abbie hoffman ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
i saw an interesting product in ny auto show, and would like to hear your comments. militech(tm) is yet another oil additive. but the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat. the setup of the demo is fairly simple. a cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. the rotor is powered by an electronic motor. a metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench. before militech was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (you pick the brand of oil, no difference). once militech was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque. here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it. they say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. a 16 oz bottle is $25. i still have my doubts. if this product is really so great, why it was so little known? the salesman said it is widely used in military. i didn't believe it. the demo was so impressive, that i bought a bottle against my common sense. has anyone heard of or actually used this product? is it real? if you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the second floor. see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not. jason chen

archive-name: rec-autos/part4 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw] [last change: 8 february 1993; ct now permits radar detector usage, new tire-traction q&a -- rpw] commonly asked questions radar questions: q: where are radar detectors illegal? a: in the us, currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors. new york prohibits their use in large trucks. in canada, they are illegal in manitoba, ontario, quebec, newfoundland and pei (prince edward island). they are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of europe. legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal. q: where are radar detector detectors used? do they really work? a: usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in canada, but now they are appearing in new york and virginia. it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and d.c. they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted. new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors. note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on. q: what is vascar? is it some kind of radar? a: vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance computer. it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks. no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system. q: what is ka band radar? where is it used? should a radar detector be able to handle it? a: ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in so-called photo-radar installations. in these installations, a low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit. tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle. because of the low power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit, although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway. the number of locales where photo-radar is in use is limited, and some question the legality of such units. best advice: learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they are used (or else, don't speed.) q: do radar jammers work? are they legal? a: quick answer: no, and not in the usa. detailed answer: cheap radar jammers do not work well at all. jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military. jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa. driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions: q: what are understeer and oversteer? a: understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.) most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter. simply put, they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less', or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.) understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into trouble. understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner. oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (trailing throttle oversteer, or tto). in extreme cases, lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning. some technical details: in a corner at speed, the tires on the car will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel. in understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels. in oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels. q: what is a rev-matched downshift? a: when downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear. however, during a downshift, normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop rather than increase. in rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed. this results in a much smoother and faster downshift. q: what does heel-and-toe mean? a: heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while braking. this is normally challenging, because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle. it is called heel-and-toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift. in many modern cars this is a misnomer; often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle. note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing the same thing. q: what is double-clutch downshifting? a: while your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of three things: nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice. the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine. this is usually coupled with rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up. the procedure is as follows: (0) declutch (1) move gearshift lever to neutral (2) engage clutch (3) match revs (4) declutch (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear (6) engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural. the problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox. in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift. basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at all. this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition. q: what do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean? may they be compared? a: in short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and 2) almost never. in more detail: the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times in the us) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source. testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road & track number to a car & driver number is quite pointless. keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the* major) part of the equation. skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically when tire compounds change. do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers. this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools. they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires. slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the automobile's transient response. however, they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the car's envelope. they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision. for example, they don't tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber. when a car has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport' setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving. the list of caveats could go on for page after page. q: my buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate or corner at more than 1.0g. does he know what he's talking about? a: 1) in short: he hasn't got a clue. 2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth, dry and non-deformable, none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature. pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent. tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over. in a tire at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term. the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking. (this latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving, don't worry about it.) because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction, it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1.0g and race cars corner and brake at more than 1.0g. because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip. an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism. misc. questions: q: what does <name or acronym> stand for? a: here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net. in particular, never ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result. saab: svenska aeroplan a. b., or the swedish airplane corporation alfa: societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili, or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat: fabbrica italiana di automobili torino, or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin bmw: bayerische motoren werke, or bavarian motor works mg: morris garage q: does vw own porsche? a: no. porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the porsche and piech families. porsche has extensive business dealings with vw/audi, which causes some confusion. since currently porsche is in some financial difficulty, there is a possibility that mercedes or vw may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this is only speculation at this time. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- carroll smith
archive-name: rec-autos/part6 [new article as of 4 february 1993 -- rpw] many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it. this article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard unix systems. a shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists. note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that i can list it in the montly rec.autos posting. also inform the keeper of the usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.) first of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin. it is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough. listserv: there is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network. details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully. the alias file: on a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as: foo: bar, baz, bletch which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch. thus, the simplest possible email list is my-favorite-car: member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file. however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin: my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses. this file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin. bounced mail: this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way. i'm not sure where he got it from.) school-request: welty school-rebroadcast: :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: "|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request here's what is going on here: the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network. the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties. school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email. school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members. the shell script i use is as follows: ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^reply-to:/d' -e '/^sender:/d' -e '/^from /d' | \ (echo reply-to: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \ echo errors-to: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \ echo sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \ cat -) | \ /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \ -f "the ${1} mailing list" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 ------------------- note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises reply-to:, sender:, and from lines from the incoming message, substitutes for sender: and reply-to:, and adds errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done. for digested lists, there is some digestification software around. hopefully i'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting. richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com) -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis'' -- carroll smith

this is a two-sided problem. unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time. the "breeding" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at best extremely weak to handle these problems. that is why low-abiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is imminent. my camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back. the persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not before having trashed the car. on another occasion, on my way from texas to florida, i had stopped in a small motel for the night in a small town somewhere in florida. about 5 youths were disturbing my car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. when i and another tenant walked out with a 357 magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. needless to say, i immediately packed-up and left. watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. they can be deadly! steve heracleous

ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. the solution is simple. sort of like the advice my aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything except your elbow. if you have pieces of ring, con rods, valve heads or stems, just reach into the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation of those large bits and pieces. anything you can't remove with one hand through the hole in the block may safely be left in place.
i have just taken delivery on a new gm car (firebird) with a clearcoat finish. i assume that it is probably urethane since the industry has moved in that direction in paints. in years past, it used to be recommended that owners wait up to 60 days before you wax a car, for the paint to "cure." the dealer shop manager said this also, but i'm not sure that he wasn't just basing it on past tradition. does anyone know if this is still a recommended practice, or is it better to go ahead and wax right away (non-abrasive new car wax) with the newer finishes? -- terry quinn germantown hills, il tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu from compuserve . . . >internet: tquinn@heartland.bradley.edu

i don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience my brother's has been trouble free. not one single repair, only regular maintainance. the only work he had done on it was a result of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended. he has a 1989 plymouth sundance. i would recomend it, but i would also like to say that if you can wait about six months, chryco is coming out with a new car called the neon, that is built in the same way as the lh's where. good luck with your desiscion.
is clear coat really worth it? yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated. on the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that i've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job. as does, alas, my 1992 laser. several weeks ago i had my car professionally polished and waxed. when i picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that i remember from a year ago when i bought it. several days ago i took my car to the dealership for some work. as an added bonus, they washed my car. unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel. now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle. i am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this. do i have any chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? my guess is 'no'. is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem? or am i faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches? information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . . scott "the-dealership-will-never-wash-my-car-again" borders sborders@nyx.cs.du.edu borders_scott@tandem.com

i have a 1986 acura integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. it is positively the worst car i have ever owned. i had an 83 prelude that had 160k miles on it when i sold it, and it was still going strong . this is with religious attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. both cars were driven in exactly the same manner.. 1. it has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.) 2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align) 3. all struts started leaking about 25-30k miles 4. windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one) 5. seek stop working on radio about 20k miles 6. two timing belts. 7. constant error signals from computer. 8. and finally. a rod bearing went out on the no. 1 piston seriously damaging the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. when the overhaul was done last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. the camshaft took 4 weeks to get because it is on national back order. everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. they went to a new design in 87. parts are very expensive. no way would i ever buy another acura. it is highly overrated. .

i'm plannig to trade my sentra se-r in with a nx2000. my car has 11,500 miles on it and is a '92 model. the nx2000 the dealer is selling is a '91 model with 23,000miles on it. it has a t-bar roof, a/c, and an airbag, which my sentra does not have. they are asking for $1500. is that a fair deal? the only thing i noticed about the nx2000 is that the engine did not seem to have as much torque as my sentra which has the same identical engine. i presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine to it's limits occassionaly while i did that on mine, thuis the nx2000's engine is a little "tight." so, if i buy the nx2000 and "excercise" it well, should that slight power problem go away? any advice on this will be much appreciated. thanks. please reply via e-mail if possible. -- a motion picture major at the brooks institute of photography, ca santa barbara and a foreign student from kuala lumpur, malaysia.

"if you buy the supra, your rate classification will be the same as the celica (the '85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer. our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.

the biggest hurdle for automatics (imho) is not shifting speed per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you try to force it to shift manually. this was the biggest fault with the subaru ecvt -- it took soooooo lonnnnnnnnggggg for the tranny to find the right ratio. the sales propaganda says the saturn automatic is effectively an electronically-shifted manual. might this mean that saturn has conquered the problem? (i dunno, only driven saturn 5-speeds) input, please! another question: any plans for a manual-trans chrysler lh? does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?

the chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the buick co. when durant was there. when the directors kicked durant out of gm in 1910 he took chevrolet and others with him. as mentioned before, they founded the successful chevrolet company. a little-known fact is that the chevrolet co. actually took over gm! that was how durant got back in charge of gm-- legally his new company chevrolet co. did the buying, and gm was a division of chevrolet! after 1920 and into the sloan era, gm shuffled things so that the gm board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (if you look at the organization chart for gm in sloan's book, chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the "passenger car division" which covers buick, olds, cadillac, and oakland/pontiac) -jeff hagen (minor deity of worthless auto-trivia) hagenjd@ac.wfu.edu

dear netters: i am looking to buy a used eagle talon '91 or '91 tsi awd. question is that the '91 tsi awd was mentioned in the april consumer reports to a car to avoid! in particular, the manual transmission, electrical system, and brakes were below par (in both models). a friend of mine ownes a '90 tsi awd and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something about sticking/grinding into second gear. this doesn't seem too bad if one "beats" on his car. i am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks. seems you have to pay big buck if you want all three. anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your talon, and any problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it. thanks for any responses! -jay

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy. it switches to "sport" mode when the electronics figure it, not when the driver sets the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, imo. so what does "sport" mode entail? several things: 1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy) 2) delayed upshifts. (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the 	low gear. this is handy if you are charging through corners and 	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's 	another curve approaching) 3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is 	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal. modern 	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode. 	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about 	to turn red. my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as 	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough. also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)? how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation? i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better. i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening. the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. eliot

in rec.autos you write: >if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission, >it can't be half bad.. :-) this mclaren auto-transmission (i still think it's only half auto, but you may be right) has nothing to do with your gm, chrysler, volvo, or whatever auto transmission. it's a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do the shifting. that means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if you take out minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions (ferrari, williams, mclaren(?),...) don't tell you, when to shift, either. however, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with your stock auto-trannie: they are expensive. as long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 'normal' cars i'm gonna stick with my manual. i just can't see an advantage to make up for two grand i lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). but then i drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway. there's no point in making a religion out of this, i just wanted to point out a few technical facts and my own opinion, so there's no need for a flame war. >eliot have a safe ride chris

(of course the cause of the montreal protocol was all the research done on the causes of the ozone depletion problem.) someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone-depleting (cfc) chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse-gas-producing compounds. the greenhouse effect (produced by infrared-trapping gasses like co2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same thing. it is a lot easier to do something about not using the cfc's (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing co2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms. planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem. fred w. bach , operations group | internet: music@erich.triumf.ca triumf (tri-university meson facility) | voice: 604-222-1047 loc 327/278 4004 wesbrook mall, ubc campus | fax: 604-222-1074 university of british columbia, vancouver, b.c., canada v6t 2a3 these are my opinions, which should only make you read, think, and question. they do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow workers.

my honda accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. the latest problem i am experiencing is with my brakes. they still stop the car fine, but once i am stopped completely, my brake pedal will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself. if feels really strange, and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of these days. i checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil). i called my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder, which will cost me a whopping $250-300. i was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this sort of thing. if so, is my mechanic being honest? or do i simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in? any help you could provide would be appreciated. please send replies directly to me, as i rarely have a chance to read this list. i will post the responses if there is any interest. thanks, joni ciarlett@mizar.usc.edu

with the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is squeezed out. they are not as comfortable as sedan, and don't carry as much as the minivans. this is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore. but the demand is certainly hampered by the minivan, and may not be economical to build a product for. jason chen a station wagon owner

one thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument over the pricing of the sc1 vs. the japanese cars is the saturns "no-dicker sticker". this makes the saturn's price low in comparison to the inflated base prices of the japanese competition on paper, but in reality, one could dicker several hundred dollars off the price of the japanese cars. admittedly, though, here in canada, at least, the sc2 is in the same price class as the civic si, not the sc1. steve hui

why crawl under the car at all? i have a machine i got for my boat that pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. it does an excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more old oil out than by using the drain plug. i think i paid $25 at e&b marine. the oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into your favorite device. i use soft drink bottles. easy to take them down to the local oil recycle center. forza!

hi netters, my friend is seriously thinking of getting the subaru svx. there is a local dealer here in seattle selling them for $22600, with touring package, that's $7400 off from msrp. he thinks it's a very good deal (and i think so too). since he knows i have access to the net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially in the area of reliability and maintenanability. please send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net. my opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600: auto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet), full wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-) thanks in advacne! -- tom locke work: (206) 865-6568 boeing computer services e-mail: toml@voodoo.boeing.com p.o. box 24346 m/s 7k-20 or: uunet!bcstec!voodoo!toml seattle, wa 98124-0346

(read remar sutton's "don't get taken every time" for a list.) finally, after playing a few more rounds of "you'll have to work with us on this price", also known as "each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said "well, we can't come down any more so i guess we can't help you" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves. hmm. i'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and i mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door. for lack of anything better to do, i picked up the phone on the desk and called another mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider. a few sentences into the conversation, mr. salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that i would call another dealership from "his" phone! i said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time i tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own. (how did he know that i was using the phone, anyway?) finally, i hung up and we headed out of the showroom. sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again. we say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the nissan dealership. then comes the part i wish i could have videotaped. as we go out the front door, the sales manager shouts across the entire showroom, customers and all, "go ahead! you deserve to buy a nissan!" so my friend bought a sentra. just so the guilty won't go unpunished, i'll mention that the sales manager's name was gary tusone. from his manner, his refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the end, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was a young novice) that he'd be able to get at least x dollars out of us, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.

hi, maybe someone can help me here... i am looking to buy this 1990 nissan maxima gxe for cdn$14000 right now. the car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. a typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43k mi). the seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards. (he said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.) being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, i don't know what this could mean... is 96k km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? or is this an indication that the car was abused? would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? the seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, i don't know how to verify this... i've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though. although the maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 accord with 70k km will have 2 years or 30k km worth of warranty left) and i don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... but, i also need a car for 5 people... when will the new maxima come out, by the way? i would very much appreciate your input in this. please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup. thanks! ryan ======== ryan kim university of toronto, eecg, computer graphics rkim@eecg.toronto.edu "do not weave between traffic cones at road works." - from the new british highway code (toronto star april 3, 1993)

hello netters! i'm visiting the us (i'm from sweden) in august. i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo. i've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. this would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (baltimore). they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but i doubt that, 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what's included in the base price. but on the other hand he didn't rent it from alamo. does anyone have some info on this? is $225 a rip-off? probability that i'll be needing more insurance? is the beretta a good rental car? thanx markus

alright, beat this automobile sighting. driving along just a hair north of atlanta, i noticed an old, run down former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older rare or exotic foreign sports cars. i saw: ford gt-40 (!), the famous model from ford, that seemed to win most of its races in the late 60s, including le-mans 4 or 6 times. two jensen interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback? porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest) three ferarries, a mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model that i couldn't identify. and at the bottom, a late 70s mg convertable. outside there was a rotting rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly sold in the u.s. and in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an alpha romeo or a lancia. it was about the size of an austin mini. the trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk and go to the outside from here. the taillights looked like they would be the round type (if they were there). does anyone know what the make of this one is? certainly made my day... -- graham e. thomas * blah blah blah blah blah georgia institute of technology * blah blah blah blah blah internet: grahamt@oit.gatech.edu * blah blah blah blah blah
the restriction could have to do with the car being a convertible. a lot of paronoid laws were passed concerning convertibles in the 80's. these states may require greater rollover protection than the capri affords. thatch harvey %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % thatch harvey % % uucp: (no longer valid) domain: thatchh@hplsla.hp.com % % hewlett-packard lake stevens instrument division % % lake stevens, wa % % (206) 335-2083 merkur xr4ti, suzuki gsx1100g, % % prince sr3 d sports racer % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

i had the exactly same problem with my '70 lesabre. it was also from cal. what i did was go to the local junkyard and pick up a diaphragm from a '68 lesabre with the same heater set up. it worked for me, but a little bit slow to change from vents to defogger. better than nothing!

it did it again. this morning, my 88 ford ranger was idling at 10,000 rpm. ok, so i exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast. it has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (i don't think the linkage is stuck). what can i do to fix this problem? this has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now. i don't have a tach, but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast as it should be. this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up at a stop light. many thanks for any suggestions. - les -- les bartel			i'm going to live forever intergraph corporation		... or die trying electronics division		 ljbartel@ingr.com or ljbartel@naomi.b23b.ingr.com (205) 730-8537

while i don't read normally read this group, i was looking for valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the faq) and came across your posting.. i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the sentra se-r/nx2000, mx6, mr-2, stealth, prelude, and celica. check this month's consumer reports for previous probe records. my criteria: a "fun" car with abs, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25k. i thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. the tri-star cars (eclipse/talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. ditto for the mustang(also no abs). the se-r/nx2000/m20 fell into the pocket-rocket category. a good used car buy. the mx-6 was almost there but rolled more than i liked. i didn't like the prelude dash/instrumentation at all. too weird for me. the mr2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than i needed, so out that went. the celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. i never considered the 240sx since it didn't have an airbag. i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that's it. the corolla never entered my mind. i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr4/dodge stealth more. since my list was exhausted, i bought the probe. :-) the car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far. for what it's worth, my comments: my dislikes: shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. headlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly. hopefully just a fluke. ford only gives 1 key with the car. c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies! rear hatch has no padding on corners when up. i'm waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car my likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for fwd; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 sho i drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) abs/air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) tires: 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles (70% left; hoping for 30k :-) as you can see, i'm primarily interested in the engine. while it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine. the overall car is a good buy for the money. that market segment hasn't changed much since july (prelude vtec, honda del sol??). i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the probe's suspension doesn't like potholes. when you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. if you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too. they'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's "better" is up to you). also, there's a lot of glass around you which i wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer. my back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat. i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when i got the car so i can't comment on them (i got the car before it was officially announced). i prefer cloth to leather anyway. i wouldn't want this car in the snow: the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing. rain is much better: water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles (and i was really trying). there is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places. the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd's max. the center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch" but that's it. no change holders. quite a let-down from the sho. and the probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car! lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back. the foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(. nathan nathan@sco.com > >^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >|jeremy mereness | support | ye olde disclaimer: | >|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet) | free | the above represent my| >| fast project, cmu-gsia | software| opinions, alone. | >|b.s. mechanical engineering, cmu| | ya gotta love it. | >| every silver lining's got a touch of grey | >------------------------------------------------------------------------ > this year marks the 200th anniversary of the bill of rights > -- mx: nathan@sco.com "no comment"/they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!

wharf wrat rites: >they were designed for speeds of upwards of 80 - i forget the >exact spec - but for military vehicles. that's 80 in a 1958 dodge >powerwagon. not 80 in a 1993 ford taurus. ever' once in a while, you still see a reference to the super- slab system as "interstate and defense highways." but whether the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is another matter. a few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks, maybe, load permitting. the military surplus stuff i've driven -- "jeep classic" (willys/kaiser/amc, pre-independent suspension) and power wagons (slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and i wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi. you just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use. designed circa ww ii as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways. for those who can't remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. oh, yeah, and narrow too. one of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since d-day. but the point made by wharfie and others still stands: if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 power wagon (or a jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, i'd suggest the american interstate. your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil. naturally, neither i nor my employer advocates unsafe or unlawful driving. --joe "just another personal opinion from the people's republic of berkeley"

anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of those car hunters? i'm selling a 1991 dodge stealth r/t and i was contacted by this company called the markham group based out of illinois. they said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't be talking to me. they talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem. they guaranteed that if they didn't sell my car in 75 days, i would get my money back ($389) and since i charged it, i'm protected by federal law which states that if i'm not satisfied, i would get a refund (which is true). they federal expressed all the paperwork to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such. i called up the bbb in illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news. so they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been over week and i have gotten nothing. so how effective are these types of companies? anybody care to share their experiences?

i was recently thumbing through the 1993 lemon-aid new car guide. what i found was a car would be given a 'recommended' under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision. the most highly recommended small car (the civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed. there were many such cases of 'great' vehicles where you wouldn't survive an accident. is it only me, or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

hi, my friend's 1983 toyota tercel accelerates by itself without using the gas peddel. the repairman said it has a internal leak of air in the carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). she likes to know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing the whole carburetor. thank you.
my bbb autoline arbitration experience is over. the outcome was decidedly mixed. i won the battle but lost the war. the arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :(. at the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the nada book was $21,025, but the decision was for $17,665. i wrote a letter to the council of better business bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you. there is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase. the attitude of chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously. i decided to take the repurchase, even though i am getting totally screwed on the price. i will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself, and i have no case for a civil suit based on the idaho lemon law. i am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the idaho lemon law is. the law allows for a "use deduction" equal to the irs mileage allowance. as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance. summary of the case: in may 1992 i bought a new 3/4 ton hd chevrolet pickup. between may 1992 and december 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair. systems that required attention included the transmission, heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor. the main problem was the five speed manual transmission. they could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts. so, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you paid too much in the first place, or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly. jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com

i was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car i saw the other day. it was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/ early 70s. it was called a bricklin. the doors were really small. in addition, the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. this is all i know. if anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you have on this funky looking car, please e-mail. thanks, - il ---- brought to you by your neighborhood lerxst ----

g'day people, 	 	are there any mr2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why my mr2's engine sounds noisy? the mr2's engine is noisy at the best of times, but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. 	i do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. at around the 3 month mark, after an oil change (i've been tracking this very thoroughly for months now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving, but more so during idling. 	what's its problem? 	also.. i don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little performance drop. it just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. 	any help/tips would be appreciated!! worried.

the answer to your question is...sort of. volkswagen had a much less robust version of this army vehicle out in the early '70's (or thereabouts). it was called the volskwagen thing, and was, of course, a convertible. i havent seen many around then or now. good luck... -mik

it is actually simple in principle. porous adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect. upon being heated, the gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be condensed. this forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle. the only problem is that the cop is very low (0.2 -0.6). max -- max g q lu, phd 				| internet: mgqlu@ntu.ac.sg division of thermal enginerring			| bitnet: mgqlu@ntuvax.bitnet school of mpe, nanyang technological university | phone: (65) 7994818 nanyang avenue, singapore 2263			| fax: (65) 7911859

i am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust for my 1981 bmw 320i. so far, i have found a pacesetter exhaust for $219 and an ansa exhaust for $190 (canadian funds). i was wondering if anyone could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible exhausts that i may be interested in. my main priorities are a decent horse power increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power. i was also thinking of looking into both remus and leistritz exhausts.has anyone got anything to say about these? i am mainly looking for the muffler only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit i would be willing to go after that. i also would like to know how much these would cost me in the states.please mail me back if you have any information. mike welker

-- my boss is interested in a new 300 series mercedes benz wagon. does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions on this car (or line)? particularly, i would like to hear about power (manual t. only) reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the line. she currently drives a vw passat, and is being plagued by its electrical problems. the dealer claims there is nothing wrong, even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road. the automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along. she does not have the new, larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power. the mb wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the passat's electrical system. she is also considering a saab 9000 (add some letters). any comparisons between the 9000 line and the mercedes would be helpful. price is not an impediment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- jeremy j. corry | churchill claimed the traditions jcorry@erasure_sl.cc.emory.edu | of the navy are rum, mutiny, and __ | sodomy. \/ my opinions are my own, but i probably got them from someone else. --------------------------------------------------------------------------

here is a story. i bought a car about two weeks ago. i finally can get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence history of the car. in between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero. therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before replacement plus current mileage. that shows 35000 mile difference comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from. the dealer never told me anything about that important story. i hope that i can return the car with full refund. do u think this is possible? does anyone have similar experiences? any comments will be appreciated. thanks. yongje@u.washington.edu
i'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it. since i paid cash for the last car i bought i did not have to worry about whether or not i had a good amount of insurance on it because of a bank loan. i just put the amount that i wanted (not what a bank would have wanted). friends are telling me that banks require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it is collateral on loans. is this true? can that insurance be gotten as part of my other insurance? i assume i don't have to pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance. am i correct? i hear about accident/health type insurance at the dealers and i am pretty sure these are just money makers for them. i just want to verify that i don't _have_ to buy these at all. or any other types of extras. what do i have to pay for? car, tax, license. anything else? ellen

here is a press release from the u.s. department of energy. energy secretary hails president's plan for alternative fuel vehicles to: national desk, environment and energy reporters contact: larry hart of the u.s. department of energy, 202-586-5806 washington, april 21 -- secretary of energy hazel r. o'leary today said president clinton's executive order on alternative fuels will make the federal government a "driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies." president clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the energy policy act of 1992. president clinton also announced that texas land commissioner gary mauro will head up the federal fleet conversion task force to advise o'leary on implementation of the executive order. "i am delighted that i will be working with gary mauro to make this happen," o'leary said. "as land commissioner, gary mauro has helped make texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country." the task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation. "the department of energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country," o'leary said. "increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs. we believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals." o'leary said that plans call for the department of energy to coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with gsa to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical. under the order, the department of energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available. -30- -- canada remote systems - toronto, ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044
i'd like to hear stories on experiences with the hyundai sonata. i know consumer reports has trashed them but the people i know that have them swear by them. they also haven't had the problems with them that consumer reports claims. i haven't driven one yet. i have driven a '93 hyundai elantra (which consumer reports also trashed) and was very impressed with it. the local hyundai dealership ("no-haggle" policy) is offering an elantra gls w/ power moonroof for $13163. they also have a sonata base, w/ sunroof for $13997. i know my preference is for a sonata gls w/ sunroof and 4-spd automatic. i'll decide which engine i prefer after test driving both the 4-cyl and the v6. the sonata is also offering a $1500 rebate. hmmm, that's another question. is the following scenario the appropriate manner to handle "negotiation"? 1. make offer 2. subtract rebate from offer 3. talk trade 4. subtract trade from offer to get final price -- rhonda gaines, systems/network administrator | internet: gaines@fibercom.com fibercom, inc., p.o. box 11966, | uucp: ...!uunet!fibercom!gaines roanoke, va 24022-1966 | fax: 703-342-5961 phone: 703-342-6700 or 800-423-1183 x291 |

i just ordered a saturn sl1 after considering a few imports. frankly, the saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. i hadn't bought a new car since i bought my honda 4wd back in '85, and i was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople i met. saturn was indeed very different. i made three different visits to the dealer where i bought my car, and was never pressured. saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what i wanted to buy. another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. he's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers. saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60k miles, fully refunded if you don't use it. that works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. using savings account rates it's more like $120. in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund. --mike

i am considering buying an new car, so i called three insurance companies in california to get estimates. i asked for the same coverage and same deductibles. most of the companies charge you according to your zip code. others charge according to your city. anyhow, i gave the same zip code and city to all three places. here's what i found (for a '93 integra gs): aaa: ~$2000/yr. state farm: 2614.92/yr. allstate: 1220/yr. aaa is non-profit, so they said i could also expect to receive about $200-300 back at the end of the year. still, there is a huge gap between all of these companies. state farm wants more than twice as much as allstate. i think i should be suspicious, but i've never heard anybody else complain. any comments? thanks, gregg l. kasten gregg@cs.stanford.edu

now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but i just ordered my first car with an auto trans. i wasn't planning on it; but after driving a few i was convinced: things have changed since the days of "slip 'n' slide withe powerglide". they shift *better* than i do, there's no clutch to wear out (honda wanted $800 for my 4wd wagon last year!- got it done for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-) (oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the motor city- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on manual. shift envy?) braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. call me a convert. --mike

all you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident, get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they would in an accident they caused. thus no need to go to court. a friend of mine did this and he got the money so it does work.

first off, the correct spelling of nissan's luxury automobile division is "infiniti" not "infinity." i would also like to clear up the question of what kind of engines power lexus and infiniti automobiles, since a person had remarked in earlier posts that most lexus and infiniti models had v6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each manufacturer used v8 engines. lexus: ls400- v8 gs300- v6 es300- v6 sc400- v8 sc300- v6 infiniti: q45- v8 j30- v6 g20- inline 4 (i must admit that i cannot remeber for sure here) i hope this helps. -bsb

hi! this is my first time to post on this news group. now a days , i have stucked at a certain problem. i have '88 mazda mx-6, non turbo fuel injection. there is a engine warning signal on the dash board. while driving, this signal turns on, but not always. what does this mean? in the manual, they say "go to authorized mazda dealer.". it is really good idea. don't you think so? i wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ? youjip won yjwon@cs.umn.edu

i know this is the wrong place to post this, but i couldn't find any relevant newsgroups in my area. for those of you who are from pa, where is vascar (where the cops measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used? i'm especially interested in the pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior experiences, if possible). for those pa and non-pa, if they use vascar in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. what i'm interested in mainly is where i can speed with the least risk of being caught. you can always detect radar, but there's no way to fight vascar unless you know where all the white lines are. thanks a lot, arun jayakumar

i've had a valentine for about 9 months now and i agree that it is the best det ector available. the point here is trust and reliability. i've been able to "tr ust" the valentine more than any other detector i've owend. if the valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo re than likely to be a speed trap. with my other detectors, i've gotten so many falses that i've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didn't want t o drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal. that directional indicator really, really helps. plus, more info is almost alwa ys better than less info. no matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br ain is usually smarter. so, if i'm going to make a decisio based on information at hand, i want all the info i can get. plus, if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. with other detectors, yo u'll just get one strong warning. my logic may be faulty on this, but i think i t works okay. although, i must admit that i haven't really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce. thomas
i agree with gaia. even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind. in my opinion, getting the powertrain warranty is enough. in my case, that's be cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors, etc.) i could do myself. i just didn't want to mess with the engine and such. plus i think the extra 3 years of 24-hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting. i opted for the 5 year plan for $375. thomas

"speed shifting" (which is what i have always heard "clutchless shifting" called) works pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but i usually use the clutch-especially for the lower gears. i think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop. and the addition of syncho rings. the gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse and sometimes first). -- frank ball 1ur-m frankb@sad.hp.com (707) 794-4168 work, hewlett packard (707) 794-3844 fax, (707) 538-3693 home 1212 valley house drive it175, xt350, seca 750, '62 f-100, pl510 rohnert park ca 94928-4999 kc6wug, law, ama, dod #7566, i'm the nra.

after a tip from gary crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) i got on the phone with "pontiac systems" or "pontaic customer service" or whatever, and inquired about a rumoured production hold on the formula firebird and trans am. btw, talking with the dealer i bought the car from got me nowhere. after being routed to a "firebird specialist", i was able to confirm that this is in fact the case. at first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio. she wouldn't go into any details, so i don't know if there were some shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier. as i say, she was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this, feel free to respond. supposedly, this problem is now solved. second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed manual transmission. so as of this posting, there is a production hold on these cars. she claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts... i'm not positive that this applies to the camaro as well, but i'm guessing it would. can anyone else shed some light on this? chris s. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- chris silvester | "any man capable of getting himself elected president chriss@sam.amgen.com | should by no means be allowed to do the job" chriss@netcom.com | - douglas adams, the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi: i am looking for tires. i would like to hear your experience on the bf goodrich radial t/a tires and/or the touring t/a especially for size p185/70r13. for radial t/a: how do they do in snow, and wet weather? are they quiet tires? for touring t/a: how many miles can they last? i believe they are in every way equal/better than radial t/a. am i right? -chan.
if i'm going to drive on a public road then i need a speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation. my 1965 chevy has a bare minimum: engine-temp and oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. my 1983 vw has tach, water-temp, voltmeter and oil-temp gauges. if i had a turbo car, i'd want a vacuum manifold/boost gauge. an oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring gauge to look at. if my car was air cooled, then i would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp gauge. a few years ago, i looked at the audi quattro si coupe that bobby unser used to win the 1986 pikes peak hill climb. the gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was: ---------------------------------- speedometer ---------------------------------- fuel tranny press temp ---------------------------------- differential water temp temp ---------------------------------- big orange tach oil-press warning light ---------------------------------- oil-temp boost ---------------------------------- oil-press ---------------------------------- alex amiller@almaden.ibm.com

"traction control" as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential. a torque sensing differential is a type of lsd, but not all lsd's are torque sensing. viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing. for that matter, so are "traction control" systems that use abs sensors and pulse braking. then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not familiar with the workings. eliot

my wife and i looked at, and drove one last fall. this was a 1992 model. it was wayyyyyyyyy underpowered. i could not imagine driving it in the mountains here in colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. i have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. i'm quite serious that i laughed in the salesman face when he said "once it's broken in it will feel more powerful". i had been used to driving a jeep 4.0l 190hp engine. i believe the 92's land cruisers (land yachts) were 3.0l, the sames as the 4runner, which is also underpowered (in my own personal opinion). they are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.

i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident. i'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true. has anyone out there with geico made a claim? i'd be interested in hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether you then had trouble renewing your policy. i'm also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or state farm.

'89s go for about $15k, '90s go for perhaps 1 or 2k more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25k if you can find one. i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never rust. in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year old and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines. 200k out of one is not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s. then there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost... if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about everything too.. the price of parts is a different story though... eliot

yeah, but i hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. not all diesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that people keep them going long after the top end is worn out.
does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a bmw after changing the oil yourself? also, i have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five yellow service indicators went out. that means i don't need oil service until it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. any idea? ps of cause i did my first oil change at 1,200 miles derek

remember roads in america are not designed for speeds above 80 meaning they would be safe at 55-65. roads like the autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked. example: a few months back i was traveling late at night ( 3:00 am or so) and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing. it curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. i wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. nevertheless there wasn't a car in sight, so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but i was in the corect lane and over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 i wasn't wasting time. it was then that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane *fast*, he had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. luckly he saw me and changed lanes in time, i estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. i was just a by stander, i had no chance of runing from him, or moving out of his way. i'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. i shudder to think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not left the time he needed to dodge me. rule: just because your car can do 100+, and your way is clear, don't assume it will stay that way. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ travis disclamer: the ideas expressed above are in fact the same as my employer, since i have none |-) e-mail, flame, at : marshatt@feserve.cc.purdue.edu ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hello, i have a 92 toyota 4x4 and in the last few weeks i have been getting quite a few "dings" :( in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the road. i have never had any major problems with other car/trucks in the past (maybe a ding once in a while). i went to the dealer and he said that it happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the hood. he said that the trucks, for some unknown reason, seem to have this problem more than some cars.? it seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem with the paint (painted on a monday morning perhaps?). how well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks? if anyone has any experiences/suggestions please let me know, thanks. --greg thorn@wam.umd.edu
i'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? i've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck i've got over 150k. i've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. my experiences suggest otherwise. what techniques do you use? on some old pieces of junk i drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. to date i've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift. my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. if for some reason i miss the shift window, i lightly press the accelerator & try agian. i've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). i also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. krispy

"inside" information had the taurus with a v8 and rear-wheel drive at one point. i wouldn't look for a simple re-paneled mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself if you do. there's a lot of potential. ford hasn't released a new car without a 4-wheel is in 7 years. the mustang project has been brewing for at least 4, right? a 4-wheel is could happen. those modular v8's are out there, too. in the interest of cafe and competition, don't rule those out, either. your ignorant if you do. and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there, who really knows what it'll look like? the mach iii? doubt it. highly. the next mustang will be ford's highest profile car. it attracts way more attention than the camaro/firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general public. don't lie to yourself and believe ford will forfeit that. i submit that the mustang will be a success. enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy camaro fans here. you know, intelligent, critical spews like, "the mustang bites, man!" some of you are already beginning. i predict that the mustang and camaro will be comparable performers, as usual. i predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual. the camaro is still a huge automobile; the mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase. the camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the mustang will appeal to the driver. the camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while the mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set. both will be more refined (i do think the camaro is). there will be no clear winner. unless the ford gets the 32v, 300hp romeo. you don't seriously believe that it was designed for the mark viii only, do you? :^) regards, brian bqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ i am the engineer, i can choose k. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ department of engineering mechanics ohio state university columbus, oh

i'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car. before i delve into its innards, i thought i'd check "net.wisdom" on the subject. :) it's a 1985 buick skyhawk (i know...i know) 2.0l efi 4-banger auto 35k miles when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting "stuck" in 3rd gear. as a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls. putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to "reset" and go back into 1st. otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive. my thoughts: either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely). the least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves). my background is that my father owns a service station and i worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age. please feel free to be as technical as you want. :) i'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free beer. <grin> skoal, chris

hi folks, i recently bought a 1981 mercury capri (my first car ever!). i have noticed a few problems with the car : 	1. it gives very low gas mileage (something like 11 miles / gallon ; i hear other car owners speak of gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.). 	2. when i start the car, it goes into high idling (something like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. after driving 4 or 5 miles, it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. i would like to know if there is any way by which i can fix these problems. or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has done about 117,000 miles). someone suggested that i change/rebuild/ recondition the carburettor. i am not prepared to do it unless i am sure it will fix the problem. and yes, i got the car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so). please let me know if you have any suggestions. please respond by email since i don't scan this newsgroup regularly. thanks. regards, --sudhi. -- sira gopinath sudhindranath. email : sudhi@ucs.usl.edu.

i offered to relay this information for a ham friend of mine without internet access: his name is robert (bob) wondolowski, n1kda, and his car was a 1985 brown cutlas sierra sedan, massachusetts plate 716adl. his ht (yaesu ft415) and mobile antenna were also included in the car. it was stolen from lynn, mass. about 10 days ago (being on april 6). if anyone has any information about the car's whereabouts, please e-mail me. thank you for taking the time to read this message. =============================================================================== | scott ehrlich 	 internet: wy1z@world.std.com | | amateur radio: wy1z packet radio: wy1z@k1ugm.ma.usa.na	 | =============================================================================== -- =============================================================================== | scott ehrlich 	 internet: wy1z@world.std.com | | amateur radio: wy1z packet radio: wy1z@k1ugm.ma.usa.na	 | ===============================================================================

when do the new m.benz "c" class cars come out? the new nomenclature that mb has adopted will it only apply to the "c" class cars or will it also apply to the current "s" class cars. does any one know what will replace the current 300 class since the "c" class will be smaller and more in line with the current 190. another question, is bmw realising a new body style on the current 7 series and 5 series. they seem to be a bit dated to me.

(technology shared with >porsche. indeed.) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain. i think that subaru's ads hold water. in practice, their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free, though some may not like its peculiar note. but as alfa has shown, a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach. eliot

hey all, i'm looking at buying a new car, but i'm confused about the insurance coverage. this also applies to my existing car insurance policy. does anyone understand what the "limited tort option" means. will it lower my rates if i opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if i opt to have it? what does it do for me (in layman's terms please)? is it a good deal or should i ignore it? i'm not the type to sue anyone at a drop of the hat nor am i the type to report every little ding to the insurance company as a vandalism claim. please help. thanks in advance. george
folks, i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months. i am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can be in a better negotiating position to purchase a '93 right when the '94s are coming out. i need something that can comfortably carry 2 adults, 2 kids in car seats, and 2 60-pound dogs. i can probably afford something in the 14k-16k range. i am interested in the suv's but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford. i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but is above my $$$ range. the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down. can anyone offer any suggestions? i am hoping for something a little more hip than the traditional wagon, and the suvs look like fun (we do a lot of camping too). veek
i am interested in finding out how the 4runner and pathfinder have been updated in the past few years. like new engine, suspension and the like. i noticed that the 1993 and 1992 4runners are identical, for example, and was looking into buying a used one. any info would be appreciated, esp. models/years to check out or avoid. thx, andy (brandt@cs.unc.edu)

radar (radio association defending airwave rights) says that geico insurance not only buy's radar for police but also actively lobbies states to promote making radar detectors illegal. i think the buying part is a misuse of money but the radar detector part shows how little they know about the issue. no study i am aware of has ever concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that users have a higher average speed. incompetence by geico? i think so. troy wecker troy@sequent.com sequent computer systems beaverton, or in article <1993apr21.171811.25933@julian.uwo.ca> wlsmith@valve.heart.rri.uwo.ca (wayne smith) writes: >in article <66758@mimsy.umd.edu> davew@cs.umd.edu (david g. wonnacott) writes: >>i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that >>they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim. i was >>worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim. i have >>also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident. > >i've read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar >guns by police depts (i'm not sure where).

you guys are correct. the bricklin was produced in canada. the national museum of science and technology here in ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display. most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. it's a big deal for a car to be canadian and that's why they have it. if anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73 riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom. -- mike harker ottawa, ontario, canada voice: 613-823-6757 -- paul tomblin (formerly pt@geovision.gvc.com) sven's law: there's exceptions to every law (except this one)
i am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles. i have heard of the le se lse sse ssei. could someone tell me the differences are far as features or performance. i am also curious to know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. and how much less than book value can you usually get them for. in other words how much are they in demand this time of year. i have heard that the mid-spring early summer is the best time to buy. 			neil gandler
i have both an '84 and an '86 camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions. the '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles. about a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car. i pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought i had the problem licked. much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months later! this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem. i didn't find any. ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system. i knew i would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem. i should add that the clutch is original, and that i've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch. my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal, the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it. what do you think of that as an explanation? can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in? now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the passenger compartment) while i was on vacation for 10 days, during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort. what can you suggest here? many thanks. let's hope i don't end up going to click and clack on this... bill christens-barry cerulean@access.digex.com

having recently purchased a 93 probe with clear-coat paint, i would like to give it a good wax job. what is the best type of wax to use for this type of finish? is paste or liquid better? i would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, i guess using cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?). i've heard comments here before about things like turtle wax and raindance not being very good, so i'm wondering what is recommended for a quality finish. thanks in advance. bill -- bill heiser heiser@acs.bu.edu, heiser@world.std.com boston university, boston ma

review of 1989 ford taurus sho -- by gene kim ============================================= background: last week, i bought a 1989 ford taurus sho, moving up from driving a 1987 toyota celica st and a 1975 oldsmobile cutlass. i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week. i bought a remarkably clean maroon/red sho with 92k miles on it for $6800. as far as i can tell, this is about $2000 under blue book and i still have another 8000 miles before the extended service plan runs out. as one should with any pre-1991 shos, i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments. however, my sho does not have the newer rod shifter -- i understand i can get this for $230 from any ford service center. in addition, the car received the full tune-up at 60k miles, receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment. for a car with 92k miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate. the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents, although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway. having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car. to my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems just as nimble as my celica! (no comparisons with my oldsmobile. :-) visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and in front of the c-pillar and rear window. parallel parking is a bit more difficult, but other than that, i love the size. in fact, i'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a 14-hour drive to washington, dc for the summer. more on the ride later in this review. engine: as with anyone even slightly interested in shos, i was very interested in the 24-valve 3.0l yamaha "shogun" engine. i was not disappointed. base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is good. you can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although i don't make a practice of this. the engine revs smoothly and eagerly -- tooling around town does not require many shifts. this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car. (more on this later.) while the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be unremarkable, it undergoes a jekyll/hyde transformation once you hit higher revs. at 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up. the engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding v6 around. the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at 6500 rpm! i've noticed that when i drive around town, i constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm i am. to go from 2000 rpm to 4000, you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves are used. transmission: when _car and driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car. i remember driving a friend's parent's sho in 1990, and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff. that was back then. the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in 1991. the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica. in fact, the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving. when playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter felt very reasonable. the 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect it to be, and the shifting action was smooth. on the road, it's much the same -- but you have to shift slowly! make no mistake, it's a clumsy shifter. when hurrying shifts, like when i was initially trying to impress friends, i consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift. i find this pretty amazing in a car like this. it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time. seems obvious, but compared to my toyota and my friend's honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy. someone on rec.autos noted that crxs should blow shos off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter. i now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more reasonable. when you play within these bounds, the shifter works smoothly with no surprises. i don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all. along these same lines, i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly. again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely. this took several days for me to get the hang of. (i think some of my problems were because i've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears.) occasionally, i have trouble shifting into reverse. the shifter refuses to enter the gate, and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear. i'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months. a quirk: when i upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500 rpm, i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment. not terribly loud, but the passenger can definitely hear it. i asked about it when i was looking at the car, as do all my passengers. apparently, this is a definitely a "sho sound" and is the gearbox -- apparently called "gear rollover". replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review. exterior: as i mentioned before, i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up. paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non-existent. looking at how older tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully, i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies. the body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri. for some odd reason, the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination. :-) shos get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with "sho" stenciled in relief. i've seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black. yuck. i don't think the car is flashy. i like it that way. i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there, but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care. :-) interior: the interior is what really makes me feel like i don't deserve the car. the seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in a black/grey/metallic scheme. the instrumentation is stock taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach. you get a center console with two cupholders, a large compartment under the radio (great for a cd player), an armrest that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways (i think), and a compartment for holding cassette tapes. there's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small glove compartment. i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink. hey, i'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design. and it's a 1989, before the interior was upgraded! the backseat is bigger than any car i've had. why do they need so much space? :-) (no smart-ass comments, please. :-) the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters. from what i hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear. mine is no exception. the left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and i'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way. a big surprise for me: i forgot that shos don't have a normal hand parking brake. instead, they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot. too bad. again, i'm getting used to it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me. ride: the suspension is nice and stiff. too stiff? it's stiffer than any car i've had. a friend's new 1993 toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better. the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps. driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair. on the other hand, taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- i listened for that before i bought the car. on the highway, the ride is great. when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue, i had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like. it's a relatively quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles. i've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails. no easy way to get rid of it, i think. over the past three days, i've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough. (not for me, mind you. but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself.) but, i've discovered, as with the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason to complain. let me explain... the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels. i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right. after i understood this, i avoid the limits of traction -- and i'm a happy camper again. it's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car. as if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy. my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds. it tracks straight as an arrow, but when driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so useful. however, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a 1993 ford probe gt. imho, it's much better than the steering on my celica st. i wonder how bad this car is during winter? miscellaneous notes: gripes: the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles loudly, other days i look up wondering where all the noise went. activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as 	it retracts on its rails. i wonder if there is a quick fix for this. 	again, other days it completely disappears. (function of humidity?) once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension 	and torque steer, i've never complained about ride. i wish the seats had more support under the thighs. also, i wish the 	side bolsters would close more tightly. i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive. i 	currently have goodyear gt+4s that cost the previous owner $500 	for four. i used to hate the ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it 	to use a volume *paddle*? now, to my amazement, i don't 	really mind... and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!! 	pretty ridiculous, though. getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore. but, 	this is no big deal. there is more than enough torque 	down low. i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends. it 	took me a couple of days before i could really shift 	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear. (hard to believe, isn't it?) my car has almost 93,000 miles on it. my parents noted that 	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage sho. 	astute observation, imho. i wonder how long i can make 	my sho last -- i just bought a book titled "drive it forever" 	for tips in this department. :-) the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop. i once 	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch 	after i started it. the car jolted forward, and bounced off 	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal! also, i began 	to wonder how strong that brake really is. (today, i backed out of 	parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed 	the glowing brake light. oops.) the driver's power window creaks when closed all the way. the same 	thing happens in my parents 1989 mercury sable. oddly, all the 	other windows work smoothly. likes: i'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day. the 	cupholders are great. i didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but 	it really is handy. you can lock all the doors by 	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together! neat! and 	you can never lock yourself out of the car. i really feel like i don't deserve this car. i really can't 	believe that i could afford it. i got this car ten years 	ahead of schedule. :-) i love this car so much that i've been telling my parents to 	look into buying one. i love this car so much that i 	wrote this 13k file -- i meant to write a couple of lines 	and ended up with this. if there were a j.d. powers survey for used car owners, i would have 	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 	car. i don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this 	point in time, i'm sure i'd buy another sho. for under $7000, you 	can't beat it. (next time with an airbag and abs, though.) insurance-wise, this car is also a big win. i pay the same premiums 	as on my 1987 toyota celica -- despite that it has nearly twice 	the horsepower. other odds and ends: much to my amazement, there is no sho mailing list anywhere. maybe because the _sho registry_ publication has filled this void. i haven't joined yet, but i've noticed that queries about shos still appear on rec.autos about once a month. owners of shos are always quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars. (maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos. :-) i've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as well as other posts with useful information on these cars. i'll be posting this in the form of a faq soon. if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up! i don't know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one, but maybe someone out there does. gene kim (genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)
the best auto-shifters on the street (and not the track) are those from porsche... they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn.... a few years back a was in a 200sx auto (you guys call it a 240sx [without turbo]) and was going round a corner.... i floored it and next thing i know i was pointing backwards! the other drivers seemed quite amused ;-) 						....shaz....
i just wanted to know: to wheelspin in an auto, you keep the gear in n - gas it - then stick the gear in d... i've never tried this but am sure it works - but does this screw up the autobox? we're having a bit of a debate about it here...
dumbest options? well here in the uk, bmw offer a 'no-smokers' option... it just means they take the fag lighter out.... big deal.... btw - i just bought a honda crx f1..... its neat... did consider an mr2 targa, mx5 (you guys call it miata?).... but that crx just one my heart with that body kit and 8-spokes.... ps: is richard out there somewhere?

-> the current 4.9l v-8 will soldier on for about two years. a version -> of the 32 valve modular v-8 in the mark viii could be offered then. how unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and 351 fords and 305 and 350 chevys can be built up. still, it will provide a needed punch for the ford to stay up with the new firebird/camaros. it wouldn't surprise me if ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the mustang. (we all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway) -> undisguised, the car looks ok, but not nearly as exciting as the new -> camaro/firebird, imo. i must agree. i don't think i've seen anything as impressive looking as the new firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 formula 400 firebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me. the bastard.) george howell george.howell%goucher@wb3ffv.ampr.org
does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos? (i'm not talking about bronco ii's, i'm referring to the broncos that began production in 1978 based on the f-150 chassis i believe) i need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all models, how easily can that be done. also, what kind of price range should i be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) i'm in college right now, and would like a jeep. unfortunately, i've got a bit of a ride to school, and i need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in the spring/fall. i think that the bronco (with the removable fiberglass) would be a better (read "bigger") choice than a cj-5 or cj-7. even better: anybody in the maryland/virginia area interested in selling one? george howell george.howell%goucher@wb3ffv.ampr.org
yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's and sound. i know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and the mr2s were no exception. now, about large displacement 4s with bad noise.. i have a 90 grand am h.o. quad 4, and it sounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. now, toyota is coming out with an all-new celica next year and the mr2... well who knows.. later- chris

i am considering the purchse of a 1987 vw jetta gli with 87k miles on it. i recently found out that there are two versions of the gli -- 8v and 16v. i know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name: the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard sunroof. oops, that's the difference between the gli 16v and the regular gl !! so in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the two models of the jetta gli ? more importantly, how can i tell which version this one is ? there are no badges that said "16v" so i am inclined to think that is the 8v version. assuming this one (the one i looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped gl which would cost less ? (of course i would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.) please email any responses. thank you. peter volpe pv9955@albnyvms.bitnet

i purchased a used 1988 nissan 300zx (non-turbo) last year. i had a question on gear/rpm ratios. right now in 5th @65mph i'm at 2600-2700 rpms. @70mph i'm at about 2900rpms. is this about the norm? i'm an auto neophyte so i'm just wondering if these are the proper ranges? somehow the rpm figures seem high. a friend of mine just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 chevy beretta (2.8l v6.) also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model z?

you guys are correct. the bricklin was produced in canada. the national museum of science and technology here in ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display. most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. it's a big deal for a car to be canadian and that's why they have it. if anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73 riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom. -- mike harker ottawa, ontario, canada voice: 613-823-6757

i loved this car, i babied it, i pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will not happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer. i don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the lh cars, i will believe it when i see it. case and point, the local dodge dealer. you drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. service is about 2 times worse than that. i had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it. let me tell you the problems i had, and i took care of this car, i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been. 1988 dodge shadow es these were replaced within the 4 years that i owned the car. engine 4 alternators rear suspension torsion bar 2 water pumps 5 thermostats hall effect sensor main computer 4 batteries these were rebuilt/repaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head. for about a year before i sold the car, i said to myself, it's a good car, i just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it. in the end, before i traded it in for a saturn, the power steering started acting up again. i just stopped putting money into it. i must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime. i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me. bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope. you can do better, and i know people will disagree with me here, but japanese, like honda, or toyota, or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product, saturn. i will not touch another chrysler product again, no way. i don't care how good the lh cars look good, and i will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get. gm isn't much better, thank god, they don't control saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy. don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which i do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years. i am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me. but since someone else pointed out c&d as a source. i will note, because i used to read these magazines, that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products (shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated k-car, and engine. whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars. no car magazine is really objective. and although there are alot of people who don't like consumers reports, i will use them to reinforce my argument (i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, i think the best one is just average. excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the lh's. you can find bad stuff about the shadow. try as i might, when i researched the saturn, i could not find anything bad about it. there is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason. much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company. i read an article, which had a sub-column, an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else. some big wig in toyota said and i quote, "we are watching them very closely." come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons saturn was created. they are still struggling because they haven't learned yet. they have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out. it's called competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the consumer, well your out.. *asbestos suit on* gaia
i looked at that bimmer yesterday. it's an '81, has about 90kmi, according to owner (odometer stopped working at 68kmi). drivess well, sounds good, body is ok, he wants $3000. i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary driver on this one, and she wants auto. the radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!) the a/c seems to have a leak. the sunroof is sticky, but operational. odometer does not work, as mentioned before. idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm. wipers are slow. that's teh gripes. the owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, rotors and calipers, exhaust. the biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty sob, telling strange stories. i hate that. i would never buy from a persom like that, except, how often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. he also said that, although i could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking it to a garage. suspicious. and who knows what milage is on it. so, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust. i know there was an article on 528i in r&d a few years back, anybody remembers what issue? mike.s
my 85 caprice classic with 120k+ miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that i am forced to post :). anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e-mail or post! 1. when making turns, especially when accelerating, there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of of the car. sounds like it could be the differential. what could cause this? is the differential going bad? i recently had the differential fluid changed, and it did have tiny metal bits in it. (and no, the sound is not something rolling around in the trunk!) 2. on starting the car, i get blue (oil) smoke from the exhaust for 5-10 seconds. exhaust valves going bad? worn rings? anyone know whether the valves on the 4.3 tbi engine can be lapped? 3. brakes. more pedal travel than i feel comfortable with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is relatively clear. pedal does not slowly sink to the floor when held down. pedal does not feel spongey, but i suppose that bleeding the brakes might help -- could anything else cause this? 4. tranny. tranny problems seem to be slowly getting worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from 3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd. fluid (checked with car running with tranny put through all the gears and then back to park, as per haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark. 5. my springs all around are just about shot -- i have 4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps in turns at moderate to high speed. how hard are they to change? can they be reconditioned? i'd be interested in hearing from any gm full-size rwd owners out there with stories to tell and/or advice. here in philly, these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted into taxis. apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch vins with a car about to be junked. about 60% of philly cabs are caprice's, with most of the rest being crown vic's with a few old new yorkers and impalas (& broughams). -- andrew white awhite@mcneil.sas.upenn.edu
i have a '71 buick skylark with 148k on it. i bought it in california, and if it'll let me, i'd like to keep it for another year. the only problem is these indiana winters--my heater controls don't work. the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents. right now it is stuck in the "vent" mode. it will blow warm air, but i can't switch the air flow to either the floor (i can live without this) or the defrost (i can't live without this). i probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse. i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow. the diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car. two questions: 	1) is there anything i should be aware of about this (other than 	the fact that i should move from indiana) ? 	2) in the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there 	a way to "fix" this? thanks for any advice/info selah, dan lovall@physics.purdue.edu

	just a quick, simple question really... 	how many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 nissan maxima. i've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual to me. i thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear wheels. also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? enough to lock wheels at 30mph? hmmmm... i just have to wonder about some of the things i hear... 						outatime ------->

anyone else experiencing a similar problem? this concerns the clutch on a 92 honda accord 5 speed. when the clutch is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up. then the clutch shifts smoothly. this chatter started when i moved to the san francisco bay area from a low-humidity environment. the dealer stated that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material. no remedy!! seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates. any comments out there?
to anyone with experience about honda civic (ex or dx) or saturn sl1: i would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image. another question: what would i expect to pay for a civic ex coupe with automatic, air, and an am/fm radio? mail to the address below or post to this group. thanks, rob bell@plains.nodak.edu

i have a few questions about the tax on a used car purchase. i live in new york state, and i am going to buy a used car. i know that i will have to pay tax when i go to register the car. but i would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or on the purchase price. also, what tax rate is used ? the owner lives in albany (8% tax), and i will be living in saratoga with 7% tax. do i pay albany tax or saratoga tax ? (the difference is a whole $50) one more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ? did i leave anything out ? what else might i have to know to purchase and register a used car ? (i've never done this before.) thank you, peter volpe

my son is considering the purchase of a 71 mgb, which has been substantially restored. the odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual mileage. the engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses. he plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine. the body and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires, front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts. the paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by a wind-blown car cover. it seemed to handle ok, except for soft front shocks. questions: are there problem areas common to mgbs we should check out? the brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way of braking action? it seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop. what should we expect it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine? the top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps. the weather was cold. should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever shrunk? is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed? given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price? gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry. while my brother once owned an xk120 jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars. any help with these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated. phil truesdale truesdal@david.wheaton.edu

it's been a while since i've reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them. without further delay, i will get to the 1993 audi s4: 1) servotronic steering: [for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is, it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws.] i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi 90 cs quattro and the audi 100cs fwd. i am quite happy to report now that on the s4, the servotronic is *inoffensive*. i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the servotronic has been loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that i have tried. it is far from perfect, mind you, and i'd be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse, but on the s4, i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined. the steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver's hands. so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s4's steering. but there is also room for improvement. i consider the s4's steering to be better than the japanese competition, primarily because the japanese do not believe in "feel" and engineer it out completely. 2) engine wheee! what a pressure cooker. with just 110 miles on the clock i did not expect the s4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific punch. for a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving. i.e. low revs, high gear. it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion. with maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph. a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v8s. the technical achievement is breadthtaking. throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. in fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. downshifts are almost unnecessary. it is more fun to use the "overboost" feature than to rev the engine. for those not familiar, the s4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing. sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by flooring the gas. as far as the numbers go, maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter. it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for. since this is quite a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the corrado vr6. the acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff. also, one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger.. yes, audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000. the smoothness is outstanding, but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve bmw. i'd say that in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v6s. however, lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined. the 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost. subjectively, i'd rate the vw vr6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5.. also, audi's own v8 is also far more musical, with a rorty race car growl when pressed, though none of these can match its grunt. the only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop. with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. alternately one could use more revs.. in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine. i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier v8. the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic. ironically, in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush. marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again... 3) chassis i've noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths. the car comes with firestones of size 225/50 zr16.. which is not uncommon at all. however, the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever. combined with the flared wheel arches, the s4 has a mouth watering macho, yet subdued look. on rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression.. i suppose the two are inter-related, but i digress. to use a cliche, the s4's body feels like it has been carved out of stone. flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough roads. with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s4's ride quality will never worry a lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars. the servotronic steering has already been mentioned. i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering. i was able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. i think a new concept is at work in this car. with its fat gumball tires, talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless. on a banked highway on ramp, i went in slow and started applying power as i went around. i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways. yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached. the g forces were thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving. you tell the car what you want and it does it. end of story. i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsx's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car. the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too, though i've read that they are prone to fade. i am not too surprised, since the s4 does not have uprated brakes over the base audi 100 fwd. harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold. i am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity. the ls400's fade performance is nothing to brag about; neither is the q45's or the legend's. brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on anti-lock capability. 4) comfort for a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also excellent. the cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 s4. all the expected gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this and that. the glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed because audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. that means that the car has no boost gauge. a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance. unusual for the germans, the s4 comes with a honda style moonroof, as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch. noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldn't consider the lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer. 5) conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi s4 at its sticker price of $48k, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition. the 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if it doesn't produce ferrari sounds. no other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is worth the extra money all by itself. the safety features are also top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags. the 100 series audis have been outstanding in government crash tests. it gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating. eliot

derek.... there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after 2-3 weeks. the tool is in fact illegal (in europe atleast). it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used bmw and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! other than that, i know of no other tool.... anyone else? about changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer audis, they only require it after every 12,000 miles (i am talking about an oil change) just a query: do you drive your car very very carefully? like no sudden acceleration etc? if yeah, then the 15,000 m oil change seems quite reasonable. but if you drive kinda fast... i'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy (a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean all the others will come on every 3k too) 							....shaz....

i used to drive a truck a few years back. i once rode with an old codger that had been driving for about 30 yrs. the only time he would use the clutch was to get the truck moving. he could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, up or down, without the slightest rake of a gear. he was as smooth as silk. it was the most amazing shifting demonstration i've ever seen! having said all that i still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch? why do it?

in my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing casey has ever done. basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met: 1. your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $x (where x is some number like 50,000 -- i'm not sure of the exact number) 2. the accident was caused by a drunk driver (i mean, the other driver was drunk) 3. you get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever happening). you are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. by agreeing to limited tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. in exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. i save $150/year. unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 5% of pennsylvanians go for limited tort. i guess that's ok -- if more people opted for it, the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal.
the bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by malcolm bricklin, who, i believe, was canadian. he was the first one to import subarus, and later was responsible for importing yugos, i believe. anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features. the bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car. if any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to design "experimental" safety cars, you will recognize the general appearance of the bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc. anyone recall other safety features? the engine was an american v-8, ford i think is right. personally, i kinda like the way they look, and if i remember from the old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad. the choice of colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible, i suppose. the delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (imo) but no motor at all. dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu carnegie mellon university applied history "i have standards. if you don't like them, i have others." groucho

hi, i need your help with a problem i have with a 1989 mitsubishi galant gs transmission. the car has a 5 speed manual tranmission. since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd, unless i do it slowly and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound. the dealer and mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say this is normal for the car. is it? and about a year ago, at 35kmiles, the stick shift handle got stuck while attempting to put it in reverse: 1- the shifter would not budge. the clutch had no effect. 2- the front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is fully depressed. 3- if the clutch is released the engine would die. 4- assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck, i could not make the car move. it acted as if it were in neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.) 5- i finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch), while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter. 6- the shifter acted normally after that. when this happened, i took it to the dealer, they checked the clutch, it was o.k. they checked the transmission, it was o.k. i had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last week. the dealer says there is nothing they can do because mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car. in all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage, and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily solving the problem). and the dealer, and mitsubishi, refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck. i know there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but i can't get the dealer to fix it. i need your help with the mechanical problems, and with how to handle mitsubishi. all hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to bore you with the long post. thanks, rabih.

could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e cd) mentioned in magazines. i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world. is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from .34 to .33. thanx
talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are only insurable if they are fitted with a vecta alarm. we're talking coswoths and porsches and stuff. just before they (the insurance companies) decided to make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a scorpion alarm ( now they've changed to the vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting the scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the vecta system. sad huh? :-(					...shaz...
i dont know about saabs but whenever there is a 'long temr tset' in a magazine they always say that tehy're are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring every so often... i wouldn't expect that from such a 'quality' car.... why doesn't anything like this ever happen on bmws? maybe coz they're 'quality' cars ;-) <shrugs (repentently!) > 			....shaz....

(the cse is 200hp. mercedes is rear-drive, so it does not have this problem.) 3) huge interior and cargo space. 4) the most "rubbery" shifter i have ever encountered. i drove a 5spd. it was absolutely numb. you might be able to get used to it - i don't know. i also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right. from the shifter's position, i got the impression that saab really designed the car for an automatic. 5) it was rather noisy: engine buzz, rattles, and creaks. (mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics.) you should also check out the new bmw 525 "touring". this is a wagon version of the 525i. it fits into the class with the 300te and saabs. -- michael chmilar chmilar@apple.com

(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method. anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is: cd = d/(q*2r) where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and r is the radius of the clyinder. to get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set r at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome. -bp

	having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said it was probably totaled), i am in the market for a another vehicle. i saw a toronado that was within my expected price range and was wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me. namely: 1. does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)? 	 2. does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult? 	 3. one power window and the power seat do not work, are these 		expensive items to replace if i do the work myself? 	 4. how long do the engines usually last( 90m+ now)? 	 5. any other experiences good or bad, and opinions. thanks ryan kinter kinter@scf.usc.edu

in a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (gary w. mahan) says: >could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e cd) mentioned in magazines. i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but >what does this mean in the real world. is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from .34 to .33. it's pretty complex, and cd isn't the whole story either. cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car. so a large car with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer cd. to calculate drag use this formula: d = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * cd * s where d is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), v is the velocity (ft/s), and s is the frontal area (ft^2). note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). note that power is: p = f * v where p is power (lbf-ft/s), f is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s). note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting d for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term. that's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed. ditto for decreases in cd. so if you have a 100 mph car and reduce cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is: (sound of trumpet fanfare) 101 mph sorry to dissappoint. -- al bowers dod #900 alfa ducati hobie kottke 'blad iaido nasa "well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?" -mary chapin-carpenter

i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be. i believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive. automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road. the manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement. plus, driving should be fun! driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore. 	in the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick. if i was racing, i'd want and automatic. for normal driving go with the manual.

i tried the autofom stuff on my 1991 saturn sc, and was so disappointed with it that i returned it for a refund. i polished the car for 2 hours and couldn't remove the swirl marks/thin film that was all over the finish. it also attracted more dirt than without the stuff.
before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm, let's go on the assumption that one is desired. the question then remains, which one? i've owned a hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get another for my new car. the alpine has been highly recommended, but what about clifford and vse's derringer 2? any others? i want all of the standard stuff; door lock interface, starter kill, light flash, led, valet mode, passive/active, shock/motion sensor, etc... thanks for the advice!

(note that not many big benzes come with manuals. if you've got the money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to drive through the slushbox.) as automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably reduced. still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel. so there aren't compelling reasons to go automatic. -db --

thanx craig.... in addition to craigs coments - and to clear up any further confusion.... the 200sx (of usa) was reffered to as a silvia turbo in the uk.... performance figures of uk 200sx are: 			0-60: 6.4s 			vmax: 142mph 						...shaz.. oh one more q: you know that new prelude vtec? well is there an auto version in the usa? i've heard of them in japan but not uk. also, do you guys get auto miatas?

yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. they even have catalysts fitted to disels now! oh and citroen have even launched the 'first sports diesel car in the world'. which is probably true if you assume if its for production purposes (merc-benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in around 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 mph!!!) 							....shaz....
in the ec, the corrado vr6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a 968'. as it goes, i just read an article in 'autocar & motor' comparing the vr6 to a ford probe (later to be launched in the uk).... the vr6 is more powerful (even more so coz its 2.9 instead of 2.8 in the ec) and more fun to drive etc etc... but the probe has a slightly smoother engine (thanx mazda mx6!)... they sum it up as 'both cars are fast - the vr6 is a bit more exhilirating to drive but only if you're prepared to work harder' 							....shaz....

on the subject of the v4,ford in the uk used v4 engines exstensively in their ford transit vans.this brings back a memory from the seventies.i played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of us bought a 1967 "tranny" to cart the gear around in.it was in terrible shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.we spent days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried pig shit came flying out the vents!!!. back to the engine if i remember right it was a 1600cc v4 and that thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now. when the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a morris minor that worked great. ah fond memories. -- pwe@slipknot.mit.edu "i'd like to own a squadron of tanks" paul w. emery ron nasty--the rutles m i t magnet lab cambridge mass u.s.a. costellobeatlesspinaltapfawltytowersmuttsavengersstartrek.tngenglandrutles

i don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem. unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight fluid. follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight. some of the cars i have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving conditions. i've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and had to replace the transmission bearings!). my older cars used 85 weight oil whereas my 92 honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).
i agree with jeff's reply. i've never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of freeway driving). however, i will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car. also, there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended not to use them unless you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent. just for your info, i was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so i don't know if it was more without the brake job. this is in the s.f bay area.
hi javier, (how are things at corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?) vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least, by warped rotors. when the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure on the rotor. turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec). there could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

"dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost". you'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!" sounds like a real deal, huh? no. you know what the "dealer invoice" (also called factory invoice) is? it's a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer. what do the numbers signify? absolutely nothing. it's a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you. note that nowhere on the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast, low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost". actually, i *guarantee* it does not reflect actual dealer cost. also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent. adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want. haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of "dealer prep" and "protection package" (i.e. a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant). while you're at it, ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash. my wife and i got a joyride in a twin-turbo mitsubishi 3000gt when we bought our mitsubishi mini-van.

hello again. anyone here done any tinting work. what are the best brands out there? how about applications...i heard there was a water based brand that s you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that. also i would consider having it professionally done, how much around wisconsin or chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap.

	tony, i believe, first of all, that max's car is an austrailian built car. i don't think its a chopped up u.s. unit. it may be called a kangaroo or roo or something similar-not sure. but, i do recall reading that austrailian cars used ford v-8 engines. the ford v-8 interceptor is, i think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor. whatever the case that small car with a screaming big block ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for miles/kilometers. i hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject. 		 			smoke 'em hard, smoke 'em fast. later, 					david hertrich.

the european version is called 200 sx and have a 1.8 liter engine with turbo and have more power than the us version ( 169 hp ); it goes from 0 to 100 km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 km/h ( 140 miles/h ). i just purchased one ( new ) and i am looking for a repair book. i could not find one in france and germany; does anybody knows where to find one ? is there one in the uk ? probabaly no use to look in the us as the 240 sx have here a different motor. i am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have good technical documentation about the car i own. regards

i still can't understand all the hype about the impalla ss, it still has the ugly caprice body (orca on wheels). the caprice was the worst new body style to come out of detroit ever! now just because the lt1 engine and a few suspension tweeks are being added. its still ugly, its still a barge. gm's answer to everything is "throw in a v8 and someone will buy it." or "add some plastic ground affects and a few stickers and call it a gt, gtz or ss, and someone will buy it." imho gm needs to scrap the caprice body completely and start over with a blank sheet of paper. no minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail amp modification, or nose re-design or even the lt1 engine) will help the existing caprice. jeff
re: extended ka bands. i recently bought a 2 band detector. you guys must all think i'm nuts, right? well, i did a little research into ka usage in this area and found out that ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states. here's how i found out: - a cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know what ka is. he's heard of k, which is what they use here and i explained that ka is used for photo radar etc.. he then said, yeah, "ka stands for k automatic"... duuhh. he then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much. - my 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps, even the real sneaky ones. - when i called the escort shop, they confirmed that ka is not used here or in surrounding states. they did claim that laser was being used a lot here, which i was quite skeptical of. so in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector, i got a low priced, high performance 2 band escort 2200. incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in x and k band detection. i know that escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but i've never fully relied on a detector and i was convinced that the escorts would be at least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet. eliot

we have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. let me ask a similar question from the aviation field. you must have seen images of prop planes with all cylinders exposed. i have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. this arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. how can one crankshaft throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the outside. bijan

i also experience this kinda problem in my 89 bmw 318. during cold start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. but after preheating, it becomes smooth again. i think that your suggestion of being some humudity is right but there should be some remedy. i also found out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!
hello everyone, i have an insurance question. allstate insurance situation: person wrecks car. car is drivable to dealer. person reports accident (no other cars involved). driver estimates damage cost exceedes cost of car. insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of exceeding repair costs. person says "wwhhhaatttt!!!! but i drove the car here!" and takes it to another place. other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the dealer. one more hitch... the car is registered in florida but the accident occurred in pennsyvania. question: should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled? please respond via e-mail if you think you know anything about this sort of thing. chris@camp.wpic.pitt.edu thanks...

well, the opel deal fell through... now i'm looking at a datsun 240z for sale in our local buy&sell. any previous owners have any experience with these cars? besides looking for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that i should watch out for? how about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc. these cars look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing resemblance to the aston martin db4 zagato(sp?), which has to be one of the most beatiful cars ever made. what is the difference between 240z, 260z, 280z? the 280zx is rather unappealing imho, but the other cars are decent. thanks again... darren gibbons gibbonsa@sfu.ca
