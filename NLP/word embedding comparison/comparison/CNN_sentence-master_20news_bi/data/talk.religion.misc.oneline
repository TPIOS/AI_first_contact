not to be too snide about it, but i think this christianity must be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires. it is, in fact, so convenient that, were i capable of believing in a god, i might consider going for some brand of christianity. the only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect to join. there are just so many. dean kaflowitz yes, christianity is convenient. following the teachings of jesus christ and the ten commandments is convenient. trying to love in a hateful world is convenient. turning the other cheek is convenient. so convenient that it is burdensome at times. dave. ============================================================= --there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.

zoroastrianism san jose, ca, usa monday april 5, 1993 san jose mercury news, page 1 [reproduced without permission] _3,700-year tradition still glows - 'assimilation in u.s. threatens ancient zoroastrian religion'_ by jeanne huber, mercury news staff writer high on a hillside above san jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the united states - dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions. with the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 bay area zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land. "there is a fear - a real fear, too," said silloo tarapore of lafayette. "we have one generation to do it or to die." many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. but for zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern. their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where "historical sites" are sometimes less than 100 years old. it was the religion of the great persian empire under kings cyrus and darius. and tradition says that when christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three zoroastrian priests, the magi. scholars say many key beliefs of christians, jews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster, the zoroastrian prophet. yet, with only about 150,000 zoroastrians in the entire world, they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live. survival as a people is very much on their minds. ironically, local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians. zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts. so if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers. "it's important to have an identity," said maneck bhujwaia of san jose, a leader among zoroastrians who came here from india. "it's important for everybody - irish, scottish, americans. it gives meaning to life. you don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. you can fall back on your own identity." for zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of. their prophet, zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one. zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda, which translates as lord of wisdom and light. _good vs. evil_ zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning. men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong. he preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions. but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly. he demanded they think for themselves. in fact, joseph campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians. zoroastrians have many words for thought. their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of mount hamilton, is "good thoughts, good words, good deeds." so it's not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly. in india, where a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by muslims in iran, zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in india is just 60 percent. about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from india and pakistan, mostly to study at universities. the other half fled from iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic state where others had no rights. local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on "good deeds" has improved life in every country they inhabit. in san jose, the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about because manou mobedshahi, a san francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple. at the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta, the zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra. the temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an iranian emigre, the late arbab rustom guiv, to buy land for six temples in north america. besides the 10-acre site off crothers road on mount hamilton, he paid for land in los angeles, chicago, new york, toronto, and vancouver. until his gifts, there were no zoroastrian temples on this continent. local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center. the temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge oriental carpets. its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building. although zoroastrians are sometimes called "fire worshippers," they actually consider fire just a symbol of god. "it helps us concentrate, just like christians use the cross and muslims use the holy book," bhujwala said. the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring. for all iranians, including zoroastrians, the new year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life. with zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the united states celebrates between christmas and jan. 1. for this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel. "the good things in life are not forbidden," esfandiar anoushiravani, a leader of the iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right. inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts. kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats. "people eat the fruit," tarapore said. "it's a way to participate in the ceremony." _santa claus, sort of_ the gathering even had a santa claus, iranian style. with flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red. he was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine. the zoroastrians from india were charmed. "this is all new for us, too," one told a visitor who asked what was going on. a visitor, john a. sabanovich of folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to iran. zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in iran followed by their promise to the hindu king who allowed them into india that they would not interfere with his people's religion. but that does not stop sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the san jose temple whenever he can. "when i first heard about this religion," he said, "i thought, my god, this is what a religion should be. they think for themselves and do good. "people who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?" ------------------------------------------------ end of article ----

(yes, i know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference. however, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the word of god and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are acting on your own authority. and so it goes).

"i recently spent some time in a "christian" bookstore in california. the service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons. but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern american culture, or other religions. a whole section was devoted to "cults and the occult," and as you might expect, mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as satanism. and i found i could either rent or buy (in english or spanish) copies of the god makers (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous anti-mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the 1930s). "it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("perfect love casteth out fear," i john 4:18). i have always been pleased that the lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though i find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the political left and american cultural and religious styles they don't like. it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked mormons---people who would, if they had power, forcefully restrict mormons' rights along with those of others they believe to be evil." the above "sermon" was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe to this people's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his arms. even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel---as in the days of christ, the church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the church. i, for one, do not wish to be labelled "christian", if those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream christianity would give it. once again, being in the majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice is louder. that's really all the critics of the lds church have to stand on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the lds church' interpretation! using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone. hal leifson -- signing off!

the primary problem in human nature is a "fragmentation of being." humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind. the bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. the warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against god, which is described so vividly in the pages of the scriptures. man was created with the order to become a god. those were the words of st. basil in the fourth century. what he was trying to say was that god created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. in the eastern orthodox church, this is called "theosis," or "deification." one can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. the story of adam and eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the creator. that innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed god, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. they become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering. this is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state. the beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. if it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed. was it the intention of the creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by god, who did not desire that his masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot? god must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. there is no other way to achieve union with god. jesus christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. he was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become god, not in his essence, but in his energies. the opposites is the christian problem. the apostle paul describes it with the utmost precision in romans 7:15-24. and he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25. mark

(although i am researching chorion a little). db... "of course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger. and bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso of actually believing bullinger, he replied that i misquoted him: >> "and you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing? oh dear." > > my reply... > your misquotes of me are astounding, dave. read the beginning of this part of > my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article. [actually mr decenso, you said that there was "benefit" to our argument, in that it caused to to rediscover bullinger's exegisis. i did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by it]." my reply... thank you for correcting your restating of my points. db... "and mr decenso also replied: > dave, these are not necessarily my views; they are bullinger's. we will > discuss the land issue in later posts, i'm sure. i'm only responding to >this one you have directed re: bullinger's views because it's enjoyable. thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such "drek" convincing....he should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of "this is what bullinger believed, not necessarily what i believe." so which is it mr decenso? do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)" my reply... one of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various bible scholars and students alike. when i present my views, i will clearly distinguish them from now on. db... "of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented no greek exegisis at all, and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual greek. thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement." my reply... good point. but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. nor have you dug deeper. i'm glad you have begun in this post. i will begin greek studies on these passages in more depth than i thought necessary, as well. db... "it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as evidence. now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough: > (a) the text itself > (b) parallel passages > (c) other pertinent scriptures > (d) historical context > (e) historical content > (f) other pertinent historical info > (g) cultural context > (h) cultural content > (i) other pertinent cultural info > (j) grammatical construction > (k) hebrew and greek word studies > (l) etc. but are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole. let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b). on the other hand he has presented no use of: (d) historical context or (e) historical content or (f) other pertinent historical info or (g) cultural context or (h) cultural content or (i) other pertinent cultural info or (j) grammatical construction or even (k) hebrew and greek word studies [remember, archer and bullinger don't count] thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings." my reply... question: do you find such criteria important? if so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (i don't mean this in a bad way). at this point in our _debates_, i have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses. i do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: judas in acts and matthew, but i will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to. i hope you will also. it will greatly enhance our study of these passages. db... "the only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage. thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be: > (a) the text itself > (b) parallel passages my reply... the reason is simple...you are mistating the passages. you claim that the passages contradict one another; i do not see the passages contradicting one another. (1) they may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) matthew may not be presenting judas' death, as you claim. but we'll look at your defense of this later. also, the "reward of iniquity" in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of silver in matthew's passages. (although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is). at this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis. db... "of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct." my reply... one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary. however, i see no problem in tony rose's explanation of judas' death... _____________________________________________________________________ how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging himself in matthew 27:5 and "falling headlong he burst open" ============================================================= this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. however, this is not the case at all. matthew relates that judas hanged himself, while peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. the two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? matthew does not say that judas did not fall; neither does peter say that judas did not hang himself. this is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. both accounts can be true and supplementary. a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. the fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. it is important to remember that we are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. on the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. in this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of matthew's and peter's accounts of the death of judas. it is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ your only reason for rejecting this is, i believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy. you haven't related how this is impossible or highly unlikely. here's what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ db [quoting tony rose]... > there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. > therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks > on this way down, tearing his body open. it is important to remember that we > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > was the decomposition of his body before his fall. "the added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible. but you seem to find tony rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting david joslin's." _____________________________________________________________________ here, you discredit tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" for the passages. but you haven't addressed why you feel that way. you can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility. questions: is matthew lying or is luke lying? or are they both lying? or are either or both of them misinformed? why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction? i do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect. db... "at present though, mr decenso only asks two questions of me: > (1) you claim acts and matthew contradict one another in representing judas' > death. i ask you again to provide evidence that matthew stated judas > died in the hanging. > (2) you claim that the 30 pieces of silver in matthew that judas threw down > in the temple and the chief priests used, is the "reward of iniquity" > in acts that pictures judas in some way purchasing a field with; > therefore there is a contradiction. prove that the 30 pieces of silver > and the "reward of iniquity" are one and the same. actually i find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but i will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points. first i would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life. in fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging." my reply... i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect. today, i got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack. he failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital. hanging attempts are not always successful. to assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is "begging the question", if i may quote you. [last night, listening to _the bible answer man_ broadcast, the christian research institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use. i am not all that familiar with them. the man on the bam show teaches comparative religion and logic. it was interesting] db... "this is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself." my reply... qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an ot passage i'll mention below. does hanging always have this outcome? did matthew, who is the only source we have re: judas hanging himself, state that judas died as a result? to say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as. a boy (age 14) hung himself. but he lived. this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover. db... "now i am not alone in this thought; in fact, since mr decenso so respects christian scholarly (including greek scholars) opinion, i did some research." my reply... thank you, dave. db... "interestingly, not one of the christian references i read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide. ^^^^^^^^^^^ my reply... [^^^ above, mine] so it's ok to use christian sources to back your points? what about tony's position. do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility? also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books? if so, should we do, as we have done with archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their "interpretation" of the hanging of judas? i am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources. you also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died. although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself? remember, that's the first criteria we must examine. db... "this included: "the biblical knowledge commentary" by woodward and zuck" my reply... which i own. it's a good source of commentary info. but not inerrant. db... "the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible" by laydon "the one volume bible commentary" by j r dunelow "word meanings of the testament" ralph earl "the abingdon bible commentary" published by abingdon "harpers bible commentary" by william neal (actually i could have presented many more as well) my reply... i appreciate your doing this research, dave. maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth study. db... "in each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation of matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus i can only conclude that the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ greek word "apagchw"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging." my reply... [^^^ above, mine] no you can't only conclude this, although, as tony says, this was a highly probable outcome. but matthew does not state death as being a result. the greek word is apagcho. matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the new testament. in the septuagint (the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus), it's only used in 2 samuel 17:23 : "now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb." ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel "hanged himself" [gr. sept., apagcho], but it explicitly adds, "and died". here we have no doubt of the result. in matthew, we are not explicitly told judas died. also, there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure. it simply means "hang oneself". db... "but mr decenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable ^^^^^^^^^ christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful." my reply... [^^^above, mine] "reputable"? you mean ones that have never erred? as far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^ as i said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ although i still agree with tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding judas' death (taking into account several criteria), i've recently noticed some new things in matthew. mat 27:5-8 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "it is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood." and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day. first of all, notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of hanging. all it says is that he "went and hanged himself." luke however, in acts, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out." this is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in acts - peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after judas' fall, he was dead. so the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________ i also wrote... _____________________________________________________________________ my reply... here we have a stickler, dave, that i have to say i just recently noticed. let's look at the passage in matthew: mat 27:4 saying, "i have sinned by betraying innocent blood." and they said, "what is that to us? you see to it!" mat 27:5 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. mat 27:6 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "it is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood." mat 27:7 and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. mat 27:8 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day. notice verse 5..."then he...went and hanged himself." matthew does not say judas died, does it? should we assume he died as a result of the hanging? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ what does acts say? act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. act 1:20 "for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.' here we may have a graphic explanation of judas' death....so, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of judas' death is this...matthew doesn't necessarily explain how judas died; he does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say judas died in the hanging incident. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ however, acts seems to show us his graphic demise. therefore, there is no contradiction between matthew and acts re: judas' `death'. ....... my reply... ...we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death. although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, i can no longer assume that to be the case. therefore, no contradiction. matthew did not say judas died as a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he? most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________ i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume judas died. it is, however, highly probable. ^^^^^^ db... "by the way, while all agree that judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing. one simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthew's version as the correct version in both matt and acts. "the biblical knowledge commentary" suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)." my reply... the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc. in a superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but tony in the above quoted post gave us some... _____________________________________________________________________ a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. the fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom is examined. from the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________ db... now truthfully, i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the source of the potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: matthew does make that confusion. of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas (ie: where the prophesy of the potter's field came from)." my reply... please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you. db... as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specifically mention "the reward of iniquity" [acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: acts 1:16 "...concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus."). now i would point out that when the bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed." my reply... dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we! act 1:15 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, act 1:16 "men and brethren, this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas, who became a guide to those who arrested jesus; act 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry." act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. act 1:19 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, akel dama, that is, field of blood.) act 1:20 "for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.' notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used. rather, it states that judas "became a guide to those who arrested jesus". but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry." what part did judas play in their ministry? ^^^^^^ joh 12:6 this he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. joh 13:29 for some thought, because judas had the money box, that jesus had said to him, "buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor. so, now we know what part judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to john), then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages of iniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by judas to purchase a field. i believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are. what do you think, dave? db... "now since i have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type i think you are, as you did to mr joslin)." my reply... i will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist, although i do not have that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view. frank -- "if one wished to contend with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand." job 9:3

mr decenso, in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas, rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject: > ...we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records > his death. although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging > and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, i can no longer assume that to be > the case. therefore, no contradiction. matthew did not say judas died as a > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > result of the hanging, did he? most scholars believe he iprobably did, but..? > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > > i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars' explanations, but > in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume judas died. it is, > however, highly probable. ^^^^^^ and > also, there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure. it simply > means "hang oneself". actually, if you do further research as to the greek word "apacgw," you will find that it does denote success. those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful. as i pointed out, i recently checked several lexicons: 	"greek english lexicon of the new testament," louw and nida 	"robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new testament" 	"greek english lexicon of the new testament," grimm 	"word study concordance," tynsdale 	"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other 	 early christian writings," bauer-arndt-gingrich 	"the new analytical greek lexicon," perschbacher a couple simply stated "hanged oneself", and a couple were more explicit and stated that "apacgw" means specifically "kill yourself by hanging." a couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for "apacgw" is "strangle, throttle or choke" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down). one of the best references though, "robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new testament," not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context). the word "apagchw" has two root words: "gchw" is the "to strangle" root, and the root word "apo" means literally "away." this root words is included in words which denote a transition. it can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word "apagello" means to send a message). "apo" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death. robinson specifically makes comparison to the word "apokteiuo," which means "to kill." in literal meaning the word "apacgw" means "to throttle, strangle to put out of the way," and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death). so while the word "apacgw" does mean "to hang," it specifically denotes a death as well. thus robinson is quite specific when he state that it means "to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging." he then notes the the use of "apacgw" in homers odessy 19:230 to denote context. he presents that example of "apacgw" as being used to explicitly mean "suicide by hanging." now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of "death," and as you insist that the bible was written by god, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of "apacgw" (ie: since the word "apacgw" was used, then death is denoted as the result). by the way, i note that mr decenso also presents an example of "apacgw": > in the septuagint (the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus), > it's only used in 2 samuel 17:23 : "now when ahithophel saw that his advice > was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, > to his city. then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and > died; and he was buried in his father's tomb." ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > ^^^^ > notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel "hanged himself" [gr. sept., > apagcho], but it explicitly adds, "and died". here we have no doubt of the > result. > in matthew, we are not explicitly told judas died. note mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew (ie" the the hebrew say "and died"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek. it should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added "and died", the correct translation would still be "apacgw," as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct). further, we have evidence that the septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by greeks. thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek. so, what you really need to prove your point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing "apacgw" and surviving. otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence. now i would note mr decenso, that everytime i go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, i pretty much find it false. thus, i think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it. by the way, as to mr rose's statement about trees around the potter's field: > there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change). now as to your other argument, ie: that the money judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers: > as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather > than some other source. i would point out that in acts, where it specifically > mention "the reward of iniquity" [acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions > what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: acts 1:16 "...concerning > judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus."). now i would point out > that when the bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately > discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that > it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed." > > > notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used. rather, it states > that judas "became a guide to those who arrested jesus". > but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and > obtained a part in this ministry." what part did judas play in their ministry? > ^^^^^^ true, peter (or the author of acts) does not specifically call judas' betrayal "an iniquity," but for that matter, neither does john specifically call judas' actions "an iniquity" either. further john 13:29 did not say that judas took the money box, but rather said: "some thought that because, judas had the money box, jesus was telling him "buy what we need for the feast"; or that he should give something to the poor, so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and it was night." note that it is said that judas left, it does not say that he took the money box. thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts. i find this forced and contrived. of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that "apacgw" means suicide. you see, since judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 13:29, because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day. thus the money which bought the "field of blood" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either. oh dear, i believe that the house of cards is comming down). maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether jesus was crucified on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas. by the way, as to where the prophesy of the potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in matthew), you say: > please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss > this with you. i am reminding you now to discuss it now. it's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues. 				later, 				dave butler 	a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence. 				david hume, philosopher 				an inquiry concerning human understanding ps. i would note again, that you are not stating that that bible is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *is* inerrant. since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely "possible" reconciliations (i of course don't rate them that highly), then the best you can do is say that the bible is "possibly" inerrant, not that it *is* inerrant.

(there is a lot more, but i got tired of writing.) in [2] we read the following description of modern lebanon: "other *major cities* in lebanon include tripoli, sidon, tyre, baalbek and zahlah." [my emphasis] this source also discusses the impact of the lebanese civil war, and the israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of tyre and sidon. it notes that after israel's withdrawel in 1984, "tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy." if tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")? why does it show up on all the maps? when population figures for cities in lebanon are given, why is tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

(one atlas gives the population of tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for sidon and beirut, also, so i doubt that it is a typo. perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.) i don't doubt that the population of tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades. in particular, the 1982 israeli military action hurt tyre quite a bit. >> after alex the g it fell once more in the 1200's, i believe. what >>other times did it fall that you were thinking of? > >to egypt (250 bce); to the seleucids (198 bce); rome (63 bce); after >rome it fell to various arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was >captured in the crusades; it was then recaptured again by the muslims >in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged; then the french, turks, british, >and today, lebanon. i thought you were talking about times that tyre was destroyed. don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to tyre but to the other cities in the area? sidon, for example? can you make a case for tyre having been singled out? >>well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye >>"tyrian purple" in roman times. > >this is correct, but they were under roman domination, and the >majority of the created wealth was siphoned off. the prophesy >hold true. they had a good deal of autonomy under the seleucids. from [2]: tyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from antiochus ephiphanes and from 125 bc onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. she started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ..." the descriptions of tyre under the romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either. and under the abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish. i still think you are stretching when you try to describe tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village. >who is josh mcdowell. a christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. he happens to quote the same source you quote (nina jidejian, _tyre through the ages_, beirut, dar el-mashreq publishers, 1969). the same sentence, in fact. he defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that i haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why i jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting josh.

tony- while i honestly believe you believe you are doing a "good thing" by posting that piece of propaganda, i believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people. i have seen the film called "the gay agenda" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying. not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it. the truth is that neither you nor i can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as i do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life i have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well. the truth is that unless you are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing. i speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society. i do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by christian fundamentalist extremists, but i know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be. it is no mistake that the apa removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. i do not feel threatened by gays, i don't understand why others are. the following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries: exodus international & homosexuals anonymous. the founder of an "ex-gay" support group chooses homo over hetero by robert pela (from gay oriented magazine advocate) in december 1985, david caligiuri received one of the advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the a prayer a day keeps the lust away citation. as director of free indeed, a national ex-gay ministry, caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style" through prayer. "i'd like to give the award back," caligiuri now laughs, "i'm no longer deserve it." caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peaked with his founding of the phoenix chapter of homosexuals anonymous (ha) as well as free indeed. he has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception. "there's no reality in it," he says, "i was selling a product, and my product was a lie." headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing christianity. "we offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains bob davies, director of exodus. he ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men." "anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time," says lisa seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked with caligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show. "these organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded." "it's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educator brian mcnaught, author of _on being gay_. "but it's really impossible to change your orientation. these people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings." caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life. a few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar. "i was really drunk," he recalls, "and i went home with this guy. he tied me up and raped me. he left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again." when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover. "he had another man there with him," caligiuri recalls. "i thought at this time, 'if this is what being gay is about, i don't want to be this way anymore." caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others. he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenix's gay pride parade in june 1985, and a few months later free indeed held its first public protest. at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, free indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell. free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages. "we were listed under lesbian and gay alternative services," caligiuri says, "so people thought we were a gay information switchboard. people would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality." ruses like this are typical of the movement, caligiuri says, adding, "they'll do anything to reach these people." "david used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls peter kelly, a counselor at phoenix's catholic diocese aids program, "like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors." caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985. "they were relieved," he recalls. "they figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that i should be a 'reformed' gay person." but caligiuri was hardly reformed. "by the time i appeared on sally's show," "i'd started having sex with men again. men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father. i was horny all the time." unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs." when he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other "reformed" homosexuals. "i didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the ha leaders were having sex with one another," caligiuri says. "we'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms. everybody was sleeping with everybody else." by the time he appeared on 'am philadelphia' television show in may 1988, caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week. when the show's host asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie. caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however. he was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect. "i was too sick to go to church," he explains. "the more time i spent away from those people the more i began to feel like myself. i began to remember who i used to be." late in 1991, caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors. "i'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says. today, caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("i'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("but not with a christian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. "i feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says. "i want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage i may have brought to our community." ---end article--- caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things. fortuantely not all of them have left christianity, but have come to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others. some, like chris glaser, director of the presbyterian "lazarus project" of west hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay. i have also, as i said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "love in action" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them. some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin" through a committed relationship. this is a horrible trap which the church has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages. yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy. this is sad. what is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions. in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place. there are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive christianity toward gays, such as sylvia pennington's _"ex-gays? there are none_. and others. there are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as maury johnston's _gays under grace_, and chris glaser's _come hom!_. i seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance. thank you.

i would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post. in retrospect i would also like to quote another source: douglas c. haldeman from his 1991 book _homosexuality_ therapy ineffective recently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, exodus international, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. michael busse and gary cooper, cofounders of exodus international and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979. the program was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was healed." they stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy." the previous article quoted in the last posting is from the advocate, june 30, 1992 called "the ex-ex-gay" by robert pela. some personal thoughts: it is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks. this was the momentum behind the spanish inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death. even later, the bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of african-americans, even to the justification of lynchings. today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach. the tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than god sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete. sure, no one is "physically" forced to stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate. as an abolitionist i advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life. a person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart. for those who seek more information about gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of pflag (parents & friends of lesbians and gays) who will be more than happy to assist you. this is a group of people comprised of gays, lesbians and bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding. try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life and loving understanding. god's love and understanding for gay people is no less abundant. thank you. pax

i was curious to check out how many san jose mercury news mentioned tyre (1990-92). here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright san jose mercury news): --- bombings in the two largest cities in southern lebanon killed 11 people and wounded 80 others. a car bomb blew up in tyre, killing 10 people and wounding 75. a man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in nabatiye. --- an israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off southern lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command said. it said in a communique that a dvora patrol boat opened fire on the motorized rubber dinghy north of tyre after identifying it as hostile. the army said no one on the israeli boat was injured. the affiliation of the slain guerrillas was not immediately known. --- rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind abu nidal battled sunday in tyre, lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. --- lebanon's mainstream shiite muslim militia said thursday that it had uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern lebanese village where it said pro- iranian kidnappers had held western hostages. officials of the militia, amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, kawthariyet al siyad, near tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of beirut. the officials said they were certain that u.s. marine lt. col. william r. higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road outside tyre in february 1988. -------------- ...anyway, i counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. i also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. it seems that tyre is one of the places where people from libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there's a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place). i counted 0 articles for my home town, kristinestad, so from now i will consider this place to be a fishing village :-). cheers, kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com. alink: ksand -- private activities on the net.

the roman catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with pat robertson and his ultra right wing christian coalition. former secretary of education william bennet, a roman catholic, stood beside the christian coalition's spokesman ralph reed at a march 3 conference in washington. the purpose of the conference was to publish results of a christian coalition poll which was designed to prove that the republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the "family values" positons of the '92 convention. conservative catholics have swung behind robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support. the catholic campaign for american, designed as a catholic version of the moral majority, was founded by marlene elwell and tom wykes. ms. elwell has been with robertson since the days of his freedom council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988. ms. elwell was hired by domino's pizza magnate, tom monaghan, in 1989 to manage legatus, a "nonpolitical", catholic businessmen's group. membership is limited to catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues. relying on a network of wealthy contacts at legatus, elwell and wykes had little trouble forming and funding the catholic campaign. the campaign's list of national committee members includes u.s. rep. robert k. dornan, phyllis schlafly of the eagle forum, the lovely pat buchanan and rev. richard j. neuhaus. also on the national committee is keith fournier, a catholic who heads pat robertson's american center for law and justice. another catholic, thomas patrick monaghan, senior counsel of robertson's aclj, is also an active supporter of the catholic campaign. the board of directors includes frank shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former u.s. ambassador to the pope, wall street executive frank lynch, former reagan official richard v. allen, bishop rene gracida of corpus christi and mary ellen bork, wife of unsuccessful supreme court nominee robert bork. in the winter 1992 issue of _campaign update_ the organization's quarterly newsletter, rocco l. martino, a philadelphia business executive wrote: "separation of church and state is a false premise that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of our constitution." oh yes, the organization's "national ecclesisatical advisor" is catholic politician cardinal john j. o'connor of new york. jack carroll

(1) stephen said you took a quote out of context (2) you noted that stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article (call it a) that took a quote out of context (3) but the lack of evidence for x does not constitute evidence for the lack of x (a common creationist error) (4) so the fact that stephen did not reply to a does not justify the conclusion that stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in a (5) you asked stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were ok, or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite. (6) both of the choices you give stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in a. (7) i assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins "could you please explain ..." was not a nonsequitur, but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it. (8) therefore, i concluded that you believed that (2) implied that stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in a (9) but we've already seen that (2) does not imply this (10) therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in a, and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists. is that better jim? it's called an argument. if you disagree with it, explain why the argument is not sound. (i admit that my assumption in (7) may have been a bit hasty.) if you agree with it, just say "yup." dj "yup." -- jim's e-mailed response when i pointed out, in a posted article, that one of his arguments was a straw man argument, reminiscent of a frequent creationist ploy.

"what the bible teaches"? or: "what the bible teaches according to robert weiss and co.?" i respect the former, i reject the latter without the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus. on the contrary. and by the way, i do respect your interpretations of the bible, i even grant you being a christian (following your own image of him), as much as i am a christian (following my own image of him in my heart). (...) # most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of # bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' i don't # think that it matters if mcconkie's views were canon. that is not the # issue. were mcconkie's writings indicative of mormon belief on this # subject is the real issue. the indication from rick is that they may # certainly be. the issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church. the issue of "official doctrine" is obviously very important. mcconkie's views have been controversial (e.g. "the seven deadly heresies" has made me a heretic! ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation"). i respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but i personally do not rely on his personal interpretations (his book "mormon doctrine" is oftentimes referred to as "mcconkie's bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine. i rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to hugh nibley's books! (the last comment is an lds-insider reference.) summarizing: mcconkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of god than i have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation. but having said this, i find mcconkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen. i'm somewhat appalled that i have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting... ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu casper c. knies isscck@byuvm.bitnet brigham young university isscck@vm.byu.edu ucs computer facilities

	i recently read an article in a local paper written by an islamic person who was upset with the way islam has been portrayed by western media. when a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played up as an islamic terrorist. however, when the a serbian terrorist attacks the croations, its not a christian terrorist, its just a terrorist. 	i have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe the press, that islam is somehow tied to violence. often times you hear things like "they just don't value human life like we do..." and so on. i was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can change this image, or how i can help my friends to see that this is just hype. i would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail, and i'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is. 					-scott vann 					buddha@iastate.edu

the observation that the tree of life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't give enough consideration to the feebleness of the coriolis force compared to, say, the phototropism of vegetation. a much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way. (although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens. so it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me? of course not.) anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents evil, or because it is the sun's twin-opposite, the moonwheel. the use of anti-sun to represent evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but i'm not going to try to settle that one just now. -- diccon frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)

the trouble with trying to find out the truth is that roehm and his buddies were accused of being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the night of long knives in which roehm and most of the sa wing of the nsdap were purged. since the accusers thereafter controlled the records, anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered tainted evidence. the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd, the sa -- sturmabteilung, "storm troopers" -- left the world a better place when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than more or less shrewd guesses. -- diccon frankborn
930418 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. [honestly.] the word of sin is restriction. [would i kid you?] does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals? quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order. taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression. i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta, frater superior of the order to which i belong. when he included that bit from merlinus x' he did us all a service. he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor. i have little knowledge regarding reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the order for many years. yet as people change so do orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of o.t.o. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual. i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself. let us examine this issue a bit more closely.... "in 1895, karl kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade mason, founded the ordo templi orientis. kellner had traveled widely in the east, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices. kellner's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann, heinrich klein and theodore reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the o.t.o. the order was first proclaimed in 1902 in reuss's masonic publication, 'oriflamme'. on kellner's death, reuss succeeded him as outer head [o.h.o.]. the 'jubilee' edition of the 'oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic. "theodore reuss was an interesting character. born june 28, 1855 in augsburg, he entered masonry in 1876. he was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police, infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marx's daughter and her husband. reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott, a leader of the golden dawn, who later introduced him to john yarker. yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany. after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites, reuss settled on the development of the o.t.o. "the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss' leadership. for example, he chartered papus in france, rudolph steiner in berlin and h. spencer lewis in the usa. in 1912, the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred. crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets. when crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time. reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox. "reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor. all was well until 1925 when _the book of the law_ was translated into german. there was a break in the continuity of the order. manyk members split with the new o.h.o. over the book, which crowley was actively promulgating through the order. he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation." _an introduction to the history of the o.t.o._, by ad veritatem ix' within _equinox iii:10_, edited by hymenaeus beta, frater superior, rex summus sanctissimus, caliph of the united states of america, published by samuel weiser, 1990. there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in _equinox iii:10_. and this is the real point, is it not? why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization? does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema? or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers? a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations. it is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of o.t.o. derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them. and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph, whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema' is laughable at best. would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way? will i? i think not. why? because my frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection i am using as an example. my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first. so it may be with oto and merlinus x'. please look o.t.o. more carefully. i do not support reuss's words myself, as i am not qualified to assess them, and i am critical of their pomposity. if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the order? does it mean that the order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles? or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement? how shall we resolve these two possibilities? i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis. they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information. they are quite often artists and geniuses. having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the order), i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands. i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta. in these moments i followed my intuition, and i've found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different o.t.o. body. i'm happily participating in social groups (feasts or initiations) and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes. this doesn't make me an authority on order politics and explanations, however. i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members. i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far. there are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision. i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread. invoke me under my stars. love is the law, love under will. i am i! frater (i) nigris (dclxvi) cccxxxiii

the following is an introduction as to who is muhammad saw as will be covered with this treatise. muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him (saw) is the last prophet of islam. he is the prophet who is revealed the last holy scripture, qur'an, by allah swa (all praise be to him) through the arch angel gabriel. he is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the qur'an by allah swa (all praise be to him). muhammad saw lived between 571-632 ac. all other prophethoods claimed after muhammad saw, is a treason against islam, against qur'an, against the message of allah swa. muhammad saw is from the seed of ishmael, another messenger of allah and son of abraham also a messenger of allah. he is the messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming. the above mentioned verse from the qur'an is from chapter 33, verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows: 	muhammad is not the father of any of your men, 	but (he is) the messenger of allah, and the seal 	of the prophets, and allah has full knowledge of 	all things. --------------------- commentary on the above verse: when a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition. the holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers. allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw. the later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not prophets. this is not an arbitrary matter. it is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, "for allah has full knowledge of all things." ---------------------- droplet vol 1, no 11, part 2 a d r o p l e t from the vast ocean of the miraculous qur'an translations from the arabic and turkish writings of bediuzzaman said nursi, the risale-i noor vol 1, no 11, part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------ 		 nineteenth letter 		 mu'jizat-i ahmediye risalesi (a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw) (continued from droplet vol 1, no 11, part 1) second sign: the noble messenger (saw) declared his prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the glorious qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet. in fact, as a shown by the words of the most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of his miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(allah forbids) sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers. the miracles of muhammad (saw) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema (scholars of islam) to the hundreth degree. the miracle is the conformation by the creator of the universe of his declaration of prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'you have indeed spoken the truth !' suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by him, 'the true ruler has appointed me to such and such position. 'at a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you. or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'yes.' in the same way, allah's most noble messenger claimed: 'i am the envoy of the creator of this universe. my proof is that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer. now look at my fingers: he makes them run like a fountain with five spigots. look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, he splits it in two. look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me. look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred. 'further he shows hundreds of similar miracles. however, the evidences of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles. all his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. indeed, many people such as abdullah b. salam, the famous scholar of the children of israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'no lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!' although many of the researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs of his prophethood. and hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways. the wise our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness. since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of muhammad (saw) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others. for whatever evidences, qualities and attributes became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as jesus (as) and moses (as), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by muhammad (saw). and since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of muhammad (saw), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. ----------------------------------------------------------------- to be continued allah willing. irfan alan, a servant of islam.

how exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being obvious? what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? and what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters, some of whom were not nazis? and what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? since the point here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist. the revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations. otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts. >the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd, >the sa -- sturmabteilung, "storm troopers" -- left the world a better >place when they departed, this is just about the *only* thing we agree on. i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - roehm and his sa buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. the feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. this fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. but this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. if you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from their footnotes? i'm a graduate student in history. writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. but my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. i'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. do the research yourself. >but concrete particulars are still no more than >more or less shrewd guesses. >-- diccon frankborn given that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars?

(a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in acts 15.) however there's more involved. in order to get a full picture of the role of the law, we have to come to grips with paul's apparent rejection of the law, and how that relates to jesus' commendation of the law. at least as i read paul, he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded. again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the law. in the middle of his discussion, paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say. rather, he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness. but ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by christ. paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading. but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law. it still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. for its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed. however for christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not law. while the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion. the quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount, where jesus shows us how he interprets the law. the "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not jesus' approach. jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremonial details. indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws. some scholars claim that mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish discussions. jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity. (mat 23:23-25) this, and the discussion later in mat 5, suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. paul's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the "ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the sabbath. he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards. the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded, and jesus talks about the law being maintained, i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law. paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision. as is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble: the law as specifically jewish ceremonies. he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct. on the other hand, when jesus commends the law, he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble. it's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the current context. imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in. paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term "law", any more than people who concerned about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family values.

tony- i read your post, it was nothing new, i had seen much the same in other typical"christian" anti-gay sentimental literature. gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates. you may be unaware of all the statistica "findings" concerning african-americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against african-americans. we usually think of the kkk in these instances, but there are many other groups. of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. fortunately african-americans had "whites" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around. there was even a civil war, and anti-negro sentiment increased. in fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them. i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination. you may think that i have been deceived or something, that is your perogative. my church, christian church (disciples of christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays. we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples. we believe in the lord's great commandment to love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so. i really like my church for last reason the most. i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes in the commandment of love (though i'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community. i may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of african-americans. many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such. i guess i've decided the challenge is worth it. in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc. funny thing is, i don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like pflag. i'm apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon (from the tradition values coalition) have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several (8 i believe) states this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gays. perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will. many didn't get it in the middle ages and the proclaimed god's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions. the message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results). the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and mr. hudson is that you have a "conditional" love for gays. condition: change and we'll love you. this is sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an "unconditional" love, one that calls people "just as they are." sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy. but then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "other people's expectations." in the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality. this is sad, but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change. it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but i firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms. it's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. gay people are not criminals. another interesting thing happened recently. a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys). this had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so i imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media. how could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry? one of my friends recently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry. these are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community. the results of the passing amendment in colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over colorado called "s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t." (i forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash) and their motto is "working for a fag-free america" with an implicit advocation for violence. this is sick, and it seems to be what you and mr. hudson, and others are embracing. we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like the christian research institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people. the gospel i believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include" people. i have several of dr. martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' but it seems that cri, has become a cult unto itself. why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away? whatever rich :-(

"the world hates him without reason." it is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a saviour. and why can't you, brian k., accept this? how can you? "the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him." (john 14:17). the animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of robert's daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of john 14:17 and 16:25. i pray and hope that i do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge. i am not perfect either. but regardless of that, i thank god that jesus revealed himself to me, without whom i'd also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very person who created me and who loves me.

"love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which christians can write both the "gentle" words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians -- in a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the words of t. s. eliot in his pentacost hymn, "love is the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..." this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below. >as a non-believer, i find michael's christianity kinder and gentler. blechhh. i think you are misreading me, rather seriously. though, given my principle that one cannot force one's own notion of "sin" on another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", russel turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of christian love. >if i take him at >his word, he cannot condemn the inquisitors, because they were >also following these commandments as *they* understood them. if you misread. i can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "god" in near succession. please go back to my quoted words above: the "possibility that always exists" is that i (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade "christian b" of my case that the inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the law of love. i must also note that the majority of christians have been so persuaded. by christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both christian and non-christian] prohibitions. what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point: 	a. i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved 	 in the inquisition. 	b. the inquisitor responds that mother church must, however 	 painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their 	 own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or 	 if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example 	 "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.) 	a. i point out that this "justification" of a failure in love 	 depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of 	 philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable. 	b. burns me at the stake. my rhetoric has failed, but the point i am making is sustained. what is going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage." in this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture. the elimination of inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between a and b. mr. turpin is pointing out that, if i am a versus the grand inquisitor's b, then my persuasion is not very likely to work. i know this; and in what- ever personal agony, i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense attorney. so, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others. at the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it properly should not, if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the inquisitor. and that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.) the point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down in precisely the "worst" cases. the "conservative" (i don't think that is the right word, btw) will take refuge in what i attribute to b above, that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a "greater good." but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. matthew 5:39ff). i am a "radical" christian *only* in that i take the gospel seriously. >(or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow >man?) and what is the "right thing"? and how does one go about >loving god? well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules. a set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting. such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions. the great commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were god and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action. a demand that i, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that i be open to trying this, than succeeding at it). "conservatives" may twist this "act as if you were god" to mean "lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep your rules." they are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy is how god acts. that, after all, is the standard accusation "against god" by the atheists here and elsewhere. that the "conservatives" have confused their manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point. >ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo >up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the >*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend. and different bodies of christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none). as a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with christianity. christianity does not have a torah. it does not have a qu'ran. specifically christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that the "christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts. the one, single, thing in the gospels which jesus specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another." 	[i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson 	 that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that 	 some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt; i'll 	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why 	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.] you are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical system. but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do? it may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems -- in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again. >i am glad that a few christians, >such as michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then >interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive >fashion. on the other hand, i do think that this tells us more >about michael and christians like him that it tells us about >christianity. i think you are begging the question. why don't i and the (myriads of) other christians like me tell you something about christianity?

(john 8:38) ye do the deeds of your father. then said they to him, we be not born of fornication; we have one father, [even] god. jesus said unto them, if god were your father, ye would love me: for i proceeded forth and came from god; neither came i of myself, but he sent me. why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word. ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. (john 8:41-44) and said, o full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord? (acts 13:10) wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (ephesians 2:2) in this the children of god are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god, neither he that loveth not his brother. (1 john 3:10) one becomes a child of god... but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of god, [even] to them that believe on his name: (john 1:12) behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of god: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. beloved, now are we the sons of god, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. (1 john 3:1-2) ...when he is born again through faith in jesus christ: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of god. (john 1:13) having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, (ephesians 1:5) of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (james 1:18) for as many as are led by the spirit of god, they are the sons of god. for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba, father. the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of god: (romans 8:14-16) beloved, let us love one another: for love is of god; and every one that loveth is born of god, and knoweth god. (1 john 4:7) whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

is there evidence independent of the fbi that indicates that the branch davidians set the fire? what have the survivors said? did the press see anything? there is, unfortunately, precedent for the u.s. government saving children by roasting them alive.

(2) even if peter did witness the miracles of jesus two millenia ago, that doesn't mean that your deity is what the bible says it is (god might just be satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today. nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way i've observed the world to work. please find something more compelling. -- _/_/_/ brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/ bskendig@netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus; j'ose croire _/_/ n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent. / the meaning of life si je ne vaux pas mieux, au moins je suis autre. / is that it ends. -- rousseau

for those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between jim and i, jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after i pointed out that he (jim) had taken a quote out of context: >in t.r.m. robert weiss writes [a promise from psalm 9:10] >gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really >busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations! he directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of response to an article by robert weiss, toward stephen. i pointed out that i did, in fact, agree that both robert weiss and jim meritt took quotes out of context. hence, i find it difficult to understand why jim thinks i am a hypocrite. needless to say, i don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context. i asked jim the following: >}so, according to you, jim, the only way to criticize one person for >}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a >}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context? jim replied by saying >did i either ask or assert that? but today we find four articles from jim, one of which has the subject "silence is concurrence": m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (james meritt) writes: >is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of >something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual >may be held responsible for that action? which is, of course, a complete red herring. taking quotes out of context isn't a crime. i don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and i'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all. does "silence is concurrence" imply that jim thinks that because i didn't respond to weiss' articles i must condone weiss' taking quotes out of context? jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself. but back to the context of my conversation with jim. jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that i was being a hypocrite. i challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, jim), titled "inductive logic": >scenario: >a white goose waddles past the door >a white goose waddles past the door >a white goose waddles past the door >...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)... >a black goose waddles past the door. an individual hits it with an axe. > >1. given that the population of geese is uncountably large, and the size of the > confidence interval for the decision is undetermined, under what conditions > could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese > be made? > >2. if only black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question > to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese? more red herrings. could jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles? could jim mean that because i "axed" his articles, but not weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... well, i can't see where he is going with this. but i can help him with his induction. i've written roughly 80 articles since january. the vast majority of them are discussions with frank decenso and other inerrantists, where i take the position that they are making bad arguments. some are discussions with jim meritt where i take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.) think hard about this jim. see the pattern? think harder. run it through your induction engine and see what pops out. dj
i addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post by dean kaflowitz in two posts yesterday. the first was made into the title post of a new thread, "is dean kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?" and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread "a chaney post, and a challenge, reissued and revised" both only in talk.abortion, but i am posting its contents into talk.religion.misc as soon as i exit here. this should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so. the second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us. the first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as kaflowitzdebatingpoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to talk.abortion alone. his lame excuse for the latter policy is that he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not also setting his newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone. peter nyikos

the divine masters most christians would agree, and correctly so, that jesus christ was a divine master, and a projection of god into the physical world, god incarnate. but there are some very important related facts that christians are completely ignorant of, as are followers of most other world religions. first, jesus christ was not unique, john 3:16 notwith- standing. there is always at least one such divine master (god incarnate) physically alive in this world at all times, a continuous succession throughout history, both before and after the life of jesus. the followers of some of these masters founded the world's major religions, usually perverting the teachings of their master in the process. christians, for example, added threats of "eternal damnation" in hell, and deleted the teaching of reincarnation. secondly, and more importantly, after a particular master physically dies and leaves this world, there is nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively few people that he initiated while he was still physically alive. (that is simply the way god set things up in the universes.) therefore, all those christians who worship jesus, and pray to jesus, and expect jesus to return and save them from their sins, are only kidding themselves, and have allowed themselves to be duped by a religion that was mostly manufactured by the romans. and emotional "feelings" are a totally deceiving indicator for religious validity. these things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions, including islam. thirdly, the primary function of each master is to tune his initiates into the "audible life stream" or "sound current", (referred to as "the word" in john 1:1-5, and as "the river of life" in revelation 22:1), and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a "silver cord". true salvation, which completes a soul's cycles of reincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved only by reaching at least the "soul plane", which is five levels or universes above the physical universe, and this cannot be done without the help of a physically-living divine master. one such divine master alive today is an american, sri harold klemp, the living "eck" master or "mahanta" for the "eckankar" organization, now headquartered in minneapolis, (p.o. box 27300; zip 55427). another divine master is maharaj gurinder singh ji, now living in punjab, india, and is associated with the "sant mat" organization. one of the classic books on this subject is "the path of the masters" (radha soami books, p.o. box 242, gardena, ca 90247), written in 1939 by dr. julian johnson, a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in india studying under and closely observing the sant mat master of that time, maharaj sawan singh ji. several of the eckankar books, including some authored by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp, can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores, or obtained thru inter-library loan. the book "eckankar--the key to secret worlds", by sri paul twitchell, is another classic. many christians are likely to confuse the masters with the "anti-christ", which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called "last days". but the masters don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as jesus was. people who continue following christianity, islam, or other orthodox religions with a physically-dead master, will continue on their cycles of reincarnation, between the psychic planes and this miserable physical world, until they finally accept initiation from a physically-living divine master. re-incarnation the book "here and hereafter", by ruth montgomery, describes several kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation as a fact of life, including hypnotic regressions to past lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], spontaneous recall (especially by young children, some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), dream recall of past life experi- ences, deja vu (familiarity with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read- ings of the late edgar cayce, and even supporting statements from the christian bible including matthew 17:11-13 (john the baptist was the reincarnation of elias.) and john 9:1-2 (how can a person possibly sin before he is born, unless he lived before?!). [ always use the "king james version". later versions are per-versions! ] strong interests, innate talents, strong phobias, etc., typically originate from a person's past lives. for example, a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having drowned at the end of a previous life. and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to another person being met for the first time in this life, because of a bad encounter with him during a previous incarnation. the teaching of reincarnation also includes the law of karma (galatians 6:7, revelation 13:10, etc.). people would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future, or in a future incarnation! "2nd comings" if a divine master physically dies ("translates") before a particular initiate of his does, then when that initiate physically dies ("translates"), the master will meet him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul plane. this is the one and only correct meaning of a 2nd coming. it is an individual experience, not something that happens for everyone all at once. people who are still waiting for jesus' "2nd coming" are waiting in vain. planes of existence the physical universe is the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of existence. above the physical plane is the astral plane, the causal plane, the mental plane, the etheric plane (often counted as the upper part of the mental plane), the soul plane, and several higher spiritual planes. the soul plane is the first true heaven, (counting upward from the physical). the planes between (but not including) the physical and soul planes are called the psychic planes. it is likely that esp, telepathy, astrological influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [see the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without an apparent physical origin, result from interactions between the psychic planes and the physical plane. the major planes are also sub-divided. for example, a sub-plane of the astral plane is called "hades", and the christian hell occupies a small part of it, created there less than 2000 years ago by the early catholic church by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a threatening manner. the christian "heaven" is located elsewhere on the astral plane. good christians will go there for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth. sound current vs. blind faith the christian religion demands of its followers an extraordinary amount of blind faith backed up by little more than good feeling (which is totally deceiving). if a person is not hearing some form of the "sound current" ("the word", "the bani", "the audible life stream"), then his cycles of reincarnation in this miserable world will continue. the "sound current" manifests differently for different initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds. in eckankar, members start hearing it near the end of their first year as a member. this and other experiences (such as "soul travel") replace blind faith. for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (3 books, 2 addresses). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important information is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine 2nd initiate in eckankar, (but not an agent thereof)

there were some recent developments in the dispute about masonry among southern baptists. i posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and i suppose that it might be useful here. note that i do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows: i present it as information. * for a short summary: a southern baptist named larry holly wrote a book claiming that freemasonry is a religion incompatible with christianity. (mr holly's father rejects christianity, and mr holly blames that on the masons.) the sbc's home missions board includes an interfaith witness department, which studies other religions and how to teach them about christ. a few years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on masonry: they concluded that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality. however, mr holly led a movement of people who oppose masonry, and last year the convention again ordered the hmb to study masonry. (i got the feeling that they were saying "you got the wrong answer last time, try to do better and get the answer we want.") anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but the dust has settled and the report is in. nobody is entirely happy with it, but everybody seems willing to live with it. both sides are saying things such as: "this was the best we were going to get in the current environment." the report commends the masons for the charity work they do, such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse. the report acknowledges that many well- known christians are and have been masons, and notes that many teachings of masonry are "supportive of christian faith and practice". examples of the latter include belief in god, emphases on honesty and integrity, and that some masonic lodges incorporate explicit christian beliefs. on the other hand, they note that some aspects of masonry are incompatible with southern baptist principles. these included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they are not meant seriously), the "undeniably pagan and/or occultic" writings of some masonic leaders, the implication in some masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many masonic lodges. (i note with some chagrin that baptist churches as a whole aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.) the report concludes that masonry is not a religion, and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals. this was in part because there is variation among different masonic lodges, and while one may include elements strongly against christianity, another may not. many southern baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably influenced how the report came out. * the information above was gleaned from "the religious herald", a publication of the baptist general association of virginia, and "baptists today", which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation. (autonomy is a big issue among some baptists. 8-) because i have neither the report itself, nor whatever masonic documents are relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee. your mileage may vary. void where prohibited. darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu milton: "we use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose." praline: "that's as may be, it's still a frog."

suppose you prove he wasn't. ref: encyclopedia of religion, mircea eliade magi: [sneak preview: later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_, a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era, probably the second century ce (widengren, 1968). the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future (saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ (2:1-12).] the old persian word magu, rendered in greek by magos, is of uncertain etymology. it may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the avestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). this meaning would have been further resticted, among the medes, to "member of the priestly tribe" and perhaps to "priest" (benveniste, 1938; boyce, 1982). the term is probably of median origin, given that herodotus mentions the "magoi" as one of the six tribes of the medes. for a variety of reasons we can consider the magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of median origin in western iran. among the persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. most likely, the supremacy of the median priesthood in western iran became established during the time of the median monarchy that dominated the persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus the great (550 bce). the persians were indebted to the medes for their political and civil institutions as well. even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid period (boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of median origin. this is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian, mentioned by darius i (522-486 bce) in the inscription at bisutun (iran), as well as by greek sources. indeed, herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the medes against the persians through the conspiracy of the magi. the fact that the magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. this seems to be attested by the elamite tablets at persepolis. there is a theses, put forth by giuseppe messina, that denies that the magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin. this thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the avestan term magavan, derived from the gathic maga (vedic, magha, "gift"), is not without foundation (mole, 1963). the meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. the maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from the root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. in any case, though there may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and the avestan priesthood. the avesta ignores the median or old persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by h.w. bailey; old persian inscriptions ignore the avestan term for "priest," athravan (vedic, athravan), even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablets of persepolis (gershevitch, 1964). the term magu has been present in zoroastrianism throughout its history; the pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. the latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the magi"). during the sasanid period (third to seventh centuries ce), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of high priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. the magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (av.; pahl., khwedodah). they also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. the corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among the parsis in india. stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the magi; the persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. the practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of central asia. the magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a magus. during the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the magus sang of the theogony (the magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. the magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or "ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. they dressed in the median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. they wore a characteristic head covering of felt (gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (boyce, 1982). the color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of indo-european origin, according to georges dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white. in all likelihood, during the achaemenid period the magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of zorastrian traditions. by virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. the wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the "magic of zarathushtra, son of horomazes" and thus the "cult of the gods." magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself. during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of gaumata the magian - in which, according to herodotus (who calls himself smerdis), the persians killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation - the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in media, in persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration. no priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the magi. they were renowned as followers of zarathushtra (zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest greek thinkers (pythagoras, democritus, plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in india. but they were also known as the chaldeans, the priesthood of babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in greek, like "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (bidez and cumont, 1938). indeed, the chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge. to understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the so-called western magi, who were later hellenized. in the achaemenid period both must have been at least in part zoroastrian, but the western magi (those of the iranian diaspora in asia minor, syria, mesopotamia, and armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts. the greeks were familiar with both kinds of magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. classical historians and geographers, including herodotus and strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. those sources most interested in the doctrines of the magi even speak of zarathushtra as a magus. in doing so they are repeating what the magi themselves said from the median and achaemenid periods, when they adopted zoroastrianism. at that time they embraced zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name. zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. it has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in the zoroastrian tradition, that the vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring daivas"), part of the avesta, should be attributed to them. (this collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by ahura mazda, the supreme god of zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by ahriman (pahl.; gathic-avestan, angra mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western iran, persia, or media (the land of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median raghiana). furthermore, it has been noted (gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange. the magi were above all the means by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium bce on. this has been their principal merit. we can attribute directly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from greek sources and, in part, from the pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries ce. according to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the gathas, spenta mainyu ("beneficent spirit") and angra mainyu ("hostile spirit") but ahura mazda himself and angra mainyu (gershevitch, 1964). [see ahura mazda and angra mainyu.] this trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with the mesopotamian religious world. in this new dualism - which was that later known to the greeks (aristotle, eudemus of rhodes, theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism, to which we give the name zurvanism. [see zurvanism.] thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism, the magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the iranian diaspora. the greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (xanthus of lydia, hermodorus, aristotle, theopompus, hermippus, dinon), even writing treatises on the persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. in the hellenistic period, the magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as zarathushtra, ostanes, and hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (bidez and cumont, 1938). later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo-christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_, a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era, probably the second century ce (widengren, 1968). the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future (saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ (2:1-12). [see saoshyant.] the sasanid period saw the magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of iran. concerned to win back the western magi (de menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate zoroastrianism as the national religion of iran, the priests of iranian sanctuaries in media and persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. the leading figures in the development of a state religion and of zoroastrian orthodoxy were tosar and kerder, the persecutors of mani in the third century. saoshyant: the avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; mpers., soshans) designates the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind. the concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of zoro- astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the gathas. zarathushtra (zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a sao- shyant, one who performs his works for the frashokereti, the end of the present state of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid." [see frashokereti] later zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of saoshyants from one to three. all the saviors are born from the seed of zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in lake kansaoya (identified with present-day lake helmand, in seistan, iran), protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. the greatest of the awaited saoshyants, the victorious astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son of the vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will make existence splendid; he appears in yashts 19. upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted unlimited power. at that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will be immortal and indestructable. brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and of asha), astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable. he and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil, which will be destroyed. the name astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation (kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, ukhshyatereta, "he who makes truth grow," and ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of the three virgins (yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of zarathushtra when they bathe in lake kansaoya and give birth to the saoshyants, are equally speculative. each of these saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind. the doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the archaemenid period (sixth to fourth century bce). it was not, perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining factor, one that enjoyed great success in the hellenistic period beyond the confines of the iranian world. a similar concept, that of the future buddha, maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source.

kermit tensmeyer quoted from a few sources and then wrote something. i will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and then address kermit's offering. john redelfs originally wrote... jr> i learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse. it jr> requires faith in christ proven by following him, by keeping his jr> commandments. such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed. tom albrecht responded... ta> so jesus must have lied to the thief on the cross. john redelfs wrote back that... jr> paradise and salvation are not the same thing. salvation is better. jr> refer to john 14:2. i responded to john that... rw> i don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise. rw> rw> rather, i see implied the fact that only those who are saved rw> may enter paradise. to which kermit wrote... kt> incomplete reference: kt> kt> see also the discussion: did jesus go into hell in the biblestudy group kt> for the arguments that paradise and hell(sheol) are places after death kt> the discussion (no lds were involved as far as i could see) argued using kt> standard christian argument from the bible that pretty much support the kt> lds position. kt> kt> christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt> he taught the prisoners and freed them from darkness. kt> kt> when he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> the arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places. i respond. the question that was raised was not if jesus went to infernal paradise before entering into heaven. no one has made a point for or against that issue, nor have they compared the lds position against orthodox belief. the infernal paradise is held to be abraham's bosom (luke 16), the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades). the point that was raised by john was that someone could not repent on their death bed. tom albrecht pointed to a biblical example that was contradictory to what john's position put forward. the thief on the cross was promised by christ to be with him in paradise, the abode of the righteous dead. john's position possibly needs to be reworked. kermit needs to address the topic at hand. ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

droplet vol 1, no 11, part 3 d r o p l e t from the vast ocean of the miraculous qur'an translations from the arabic and turkish writings of bediuzzaman said nursi, the risale-i noor vol 1, no 11, part 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------ 		 nineteenth letter 		 mu'jizat-i ahmediye risalesi a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw, part 3 (continued from droplet vol 1, no 11, part 2) third sign: the miracles of muhammad (saw) are extremely varied. because his messengership is universal, he has been distinguished by miracles that relate to almost all species of creation. just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so, too, when the supreme messenger of the monarch of pre- and post-eternity (ezel and ebed sultani) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe, each species of creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and each bearing one of his miracles. now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles. as the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of his prophethood, here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports. the evidences of the prophethood of muhammad (saw) fall into two main categories: the first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his declaration of prophethood. the second group pertains to all the remaining evidences of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: 1) those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood, and 	2) those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood. the latter has also two parts: 	2.1) the evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfection, and 2.2) the miracles that: related to substantial matters. the last part again has two branches: 	2.2.1) those concerning the qur'an and spirituality, and 	2.2.2) those relating to matter and creation. this last branch is again divided into two categories: 	2.2.2.1) the first involves the paranormal happenings that occured during his mission either to break the stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the faith of the belivers. this category has twenty different sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals each of these sons has also many instances, and thus has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by consensus. 	2.2.2.2) as for the second category, this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon allah (swt)'s instructions. now starting from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1) (1) unfonunately, i could not write as i had intended without choice, i wrote as my head dictated, and i could not completely conform to the order of this classification. ----------------------------------------------------------------- to be continued allah willing. irfan alan, a servant of islam.

so we have this highly christian religious order that put fire on their house, killing most of the people inside. i'm not that annoyed about the adults, they knew supposedly what they were doing, and it's their own actions. what i mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside, including mothers, let the children suffer and die during awful conditions. if this is considered religious following to the end, i'm proud that i don't follow such fanatical and non-compassionate religions. you might want to die for whatever purpose, but please spare the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all. i have a hard time just now understanding that christianity knows about the word compassion. christians, do you think the actions today would produce a good picture of your religion? kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com. alink: ksand -- private activities on the net.

dear rob, >when i read brian k.'s postings, i find someone who is honestly seeking >the truth. when i read your response here, i see condescension. when you >reply to a post, reply to the post you quote. this statement undermines >any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading). sometimes i do come across condesending, and i am sorry i come across that way at times. thank you for the reproach, i really do appreciate it. i'll try to get better. rob, at the same time, i have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke. brian k., so far, only responds to the latter. and i am glad he responds at all. in both cases of approach, my intention is to be loving. i am making no excuse for myself if i am coming across condesending. i apologize for that. rob, sometimes brian k. comes across as honest. i know this. but brian k. vasillates back and forth. one post looks honest; the next is an excuse. now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less. i think brian kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses. i just want brian k. to be honest with himself. if he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my god. i wish brian would read the bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock god. from my perspective rob, when i look at brian kendig, i see a man standing out in the middle of a highway. off into the distance i see a mack truck heading right for him, but brian k. is faced away from the oncoming truck. he doesn't see it. here's is how i see the dialog: me: "brian k, please step aside before you get run over." bk: "there is no truck." me: "turn around at look." bk: "no." me: "look! you will be healthier if you do take a look at the oncoming truck." bk: "no. explain to me why trucks exist." me: "turn around or you will run over." bk: "no. i won't because i like hiking and tomorrow is tuesday." me: "you blind fool! why do you choose ignorance? you have nothing to lose if you look. but if do not look, you will certainly lose your life." i do not want to see you squashed all over the road. bk: "it is my life to lose. i rather not look. besides, a truck running over me will not harm me." and by the way, i really have an open mind." so is my motivation to belittle brian, or to love brian the best i know how? i do not wish to single brian kendig out. because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category. perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives. i have. i can now see the truck behind brian. my hope is that brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him. my hope is that brian will want to step out of the way. my fear, though, is that brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over. but if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing i can do beyond that to change his mind. for it is his choice. but at this very moment, brian hasn't gotten even that far. he is still at the point where he does not want to look. sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture. so far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. thank you again rob for your reproach. i really do appreciate it. (my wife tells me the same thing at times.) :-) i will try to do better.

(just a note: i really don't know your views on homosexuality, i am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.) the moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered. the sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. > in support for the first assumption: > > the christian scriptures say this: 	(evidence deleted) i'm not going to accept your evidence for this. you ask us to accept "the word of god" that everything good comes from god. this is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs. still, i must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part. > > ************************************** > > now then what are some of the major themes/motifs in the > pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

. it should be remembered that all of the first reports came from the fbi, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not allowed to get close and see things for themselves. official communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue them. people in general tend to believe first reports, as these get the most and the biggest headlines. corrections are often overlooked. an example is the fbi report that several of the bodies found in the rubble had bullet wounds. the local coroner, who is independent of the fbi, has so far found no bullet wounds! .

"feelings" have nothing to do with guilt. feelings arise from the state of being guilty. feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive. feelings are a reaction from guilt. jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the reaction. let me give you an example: have you ever made a mistake? have you ever lied to someone? even a little white lie? have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know? have you ever hated someone? have you ever been selfish? are you guilty of any one of these? the answer is of course, yes. you are guilty. period. that is it what jesus is getting at. no big surprise. feelings do not even enter the picture. consider jesus's use of the word "guilt" as how a court uses it. jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect. the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners. we all do bad things. even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners. it is it in our nature to do bad things. we are sinners, therefore we do bad things. being a sinner is fact. it is not a pleasant fact. but it is just a fact. we are not perfect. calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being. guilty as charged. > and then there's this single personality that will save you from this > universal guilt feeling. you can handle your guilt in one of two ways: acknowledge you made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in the meantime, not punishing yourself for it: which is the way jesus wants you to handle or it. this is the healthy way. or two, the destructive way: put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to say a thousand hail marys . . . even to suicide. this the way jesus does not want us to deal with it. all people fall into this category to some extent in their lives. jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling. jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt. jesus knows we are guilty. that isn't new to him. it is no big deal to him. he just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him. that is what he wants you to know. why, because he wants to have your company. you are immensely valuable to him. jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship. god is perfect. we are not. you cannot fit a square peg into a round hole. however, god has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him. god has provided jesus, so that whosoever just believes in jesus, will have their nature changed. the holy spirit will move it. and now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and god communicate with each through his unifying holy spirit. the benefits of this are endless. for with the divine nature living within us, we can now see our imperfections better. we can now head them off at the pass. with the power of the holy spirit living in us, we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings. because the divine nature lives within us, we can now understand profound bible passages that never before we could understand. because the divine nature now lives within us, we now have authority over demonic forces. and lastly, because the divine nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the holy spirit is eternal. the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance. because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living god. remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he separated the "goats from the sheep". many people in the last day will ask him, "didn't i prophesy in your name and do miracles, and do good things in your name?" and what did jesus say? "depart from me, for i never *knew* you." that is the cornerstone of christianity, kent. jesus must know you as his friend. it is your relationship to jesus. if he is your friend and you are his, you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven. > brian, i will tell you a secret, i don't feel guilty at all, > i do mistakes, and i regret them, however i've never had this > huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder. good. it shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself. that is the second greatest commandment jesus taught. if only more people could do as you do. as i said before, in the common english venacular, "feeling guilty" has a different meaning than the state of guilt. > this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain > personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain > religious doctrines. and if your personality type is > opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain > world view system. i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love. > there are humans that subscribe to the same notion. the nice > thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden, > the shoulders feel far more relaxed! yes. you have stated what jesus said. remember? "come to me, take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light." a yoke is used to direct oxen to do work. once you have a relationship with jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life. having god at your side is of great advantage.
robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things like "it is held that..." (cf. "kermit" thread). on what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?" who is that "holds that" luke meant what you said he meant? whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to "look at the bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those who see biblical things differently from you? are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it? just curious, -- rick anderson librba@byuvm.bitnet
rick anderson writes: > are we to simply assume that you [referring to robert weiss] are the only > one who really understands it [biblical scriptures]? no. i also understand it. i have read the bible from cover to cover, examining each book within, cross-comparing them, etc. and i have come to same conclusions as robert weiss. so rick, why not read the bible for yourself? it is written in plain english. decide for yourself.

this discussion on "objective" seems to be falling into solipsism (eg: the recent challenge from frank dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena). someones even made the statement that science is "subjective" and that even atom are "subjective." this is getting a bit silly and the word "objective" is losing all meaning. lets start by remembering the definition of "objective" which has been already presented: objective adj. 1. of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept. 2. having actual existence. 3.a. unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. based on observable phenomenon. the objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though that observation can change the outcome). nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people). thus to say that science is not objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science. now i will agree that science is not objectively "good;" i will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. now some examples things which are "objective": a d-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox. chlorophyll is green. seawater contains salt. there exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently). ozone blocks ultraviolet light. ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin cancer. "good" on the other hand is a value judgement. it doesn't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined "good"). we cannot quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: i have a bag full of "good"). now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" an objective meaning, e.g. "good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc. that though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see "strength" and etc, as necessarily "good" (eg: strength inspired by naziism is not generally viewed as "good"). as to a morality, i cannot say that i have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon. the closest i have seen is some form of the "golden rule," which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a manner you won't like. this is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face," they will often retaliate. another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can at times, ignore that form of the "golden rule" without fear of reprisal. now as to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quite subjective. by the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical existence unto itself. also note that i have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality, or that i could not accept any such a morality; i have simply stated that i have seen no evidence of any such morality. one other thing to notice, "objective" is many times used as synonymous with "true" and/or "absolute," and "subjective" sometimes has the connotation of "false" and/or "relative." tain't necessarily so. for instance, when a conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be both objective and false. as to "absolute," it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that tnt is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean that all tnt will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either. on the other hand, something subjective can also be either "absolutist," or "true." for instance, there are some theists who are specifically "absolutist" in their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up. further, many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a "gut feeling" or "hunch"), to investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis. on the whole though, i would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence. 				later, 				dave butler in starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be simple and dignified. 				diogenes

(1) you have no evidence that david koresh or his followers were "packing" that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that recreational and self-defense purposes. (2) your statement that "the public also has rights" is correct only is parsed as "the individuals who comprise the public also have rights." there is no separate rights-bearing entity known as "the public". (3) since the "rights of the public" of which you spoke are in fact only rights of individuals, the statement that the rights of the public should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning. (4) you have artificially created an illusionary conflict of individuals' rights when you speak of "my right to rape your daughter." no person has the right to rape another person, therefore there is no conflict. (5) how do you define "society?" do you hold that this "society" is a rights-bearing entity which is separate from any individual people? how do you define a "threat to society?" to what extent do you believe that a person loses his rights when he is declared (by whom?) to be such a threat? -- william december starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>
jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe: the *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured in the past. these *facts* exist with or without a theory. the *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions. the *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why. a theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. a theory is a mental construct, a speculation, a model. if it is a good model, it may be useful. in science a theory is something that is supported by the evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. a *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it. when a new hypothesis is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts. it is so simple.... i'm surprised that this subject gets beat to death about once a month. a quick glance in a dictionary would clear up 99% of the confusion and bandwidth in this newsgroup. then we could talk about really important things like, why do men have nipples? -david utidjian- utidjian@remarque.berkeley.edu -

(this includes your favorite author's history of whatever.) every text is a historical fact. every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose. hence, every text can serve as historical evidence. the question is: what can we learn from a text? of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence? the diaries of the followers of the maharishi, formerly of oregon, are historical evidence. the gospels are historical evidence. the letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in eastern europe are historical evidence. the modern american history textbooks that whitewash "great american figures" are historical evidence. these are all historical evidence of various things. they are *not* much evidence at all that the maharishi, formerly of oregon, could levitate; that jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "great american figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. they are better evidence that some people "saw" the maharishi, late of oregon, levitate; that some of the early christians thought jesus was resurrected; that many people in eastern europe "saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history. how does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces? this is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. there are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject. i enjoy david hackett fischer's "historian's fallacies" as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history. it's relatively cheap. it's easy to read. give it a try. russell
hello ceci: my name is tony and i have a few comments on your "rosicrucian" adventure. i hereby state that i am not claiming or denying membership in any order, fraternity etc. with or without the word "rosicrucian" in the name of the organization. i only claim having done some "homework" :-) this is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. heck, english may be my second language! (and then again maybe not by now :-) i proceed: > >i had an ehum, interesting experience with the rosicrucians, or at >least rosicrucians of some sort last sunday. > let's start with the name "rosicrucian". i took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a "rosicrucian" body and being *a* rosicrucian. so when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". at least that is what your observation suggests :-) i'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in san jose, ca; this being the rc org with the most members (last time i looked). of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best". anyway, the lectorium rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the "gold-und-rosenkreuz" (golden and rosy cross), from the 18th century. there were two "golden and rosy cross", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-). "you'll have to trust me" when i tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by amorc, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, imho. >the first guy also said that the r:s are a mystical christian order, and >that they base their teachings on the teachings of the kathars >(english?) from the thirteenth century. > again, instead of r:s, it should be "lectorium rosicrucianum" :-). it is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be *non- sectarian*. the cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. they flourished during the 12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. it was largely in response to the church's unseemly pomp and splendor that catharism took root, first in northern italy, then throughout the south of france. >what made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all >contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, >then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently, >but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. i don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing something divine"... and yes i don't like phrases like "eternal bliss" either! :-) >how to robotize people and brainwash... > for a moment i thought you were referring to madison ave :-) (madison avenue in new york city is where the most influential (read $$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the usa :-) peace, tony btw, i have read the intro letters of the lrc which they will mail you free of charge.

if you would like to understand better the sort of behavior that we saw in connection with the waco tragedy, i'd strongly recommend reading _when prophecy fails_, by leon festinger, henry riecken, and stanley schachter (available as a harper torchbook). it goes a long way towards explaining how a belief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming disconfirmatory evidence. at least, read the first chapter. interestingly, just as the branch davidians had roots in the seventh-day adventist movement, the sdas themselves had their roots in the millerite movement of the first half of the 19th century--a movement that expected the end of the world in 1843, was disappointed when it did not take place, and wound up as a church. bill -- if you meet the buddha on the net, put him in your kill file 	--robert firth
/(emery) /the one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the /world over the centuries is the resurrection of jesus. this is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about christ. the majority of the rest of the world have decided that he is not who emery thinks he is. /(emery) /why were the writers of the new testament documents so convinced that /jesus really did rise from the dead? /we have four gospel accounts. i am leaving out all "proofs" of emery's which rely on quoting the bible as proof. circular reasoning, etc. there have been occasions already stated many times for later generations of xtians to change, edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel. and if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it is true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the bhagavad-gita and the koran, both of which contradict the bible. enough said. /(emery) /yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest. /we have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that /these people were not god-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly /believed that the resurrection of their lord jesus was a real event. /and for what gain would they lie? to make a stand at that time meant /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death. again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof of any of this happening. it just isn't there. besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not make your faith correct. there are muslims dying in bosnia right now; does the fact that they are willing to die for islam mean that islam is the correct religion? (emery) /history bears out the persecution of christians. roman historian, cornelius /tacitus, govenor of asia, in a.d. 112, writing of nero's reign, alluded to /the torture of christians in rome: all you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith. that does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they were sincere in their beliefs. being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth. it's not that easy. and minority religions have always suffered torture; muslims suffer torture and harassment in india and bosnia today. all religions are harassed in china today. you haven't proven anything so far. /(emery) /with all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it /would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy /would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax. not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax. /(emery) /yet not one did. it seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make /up the resurrection but sincerely believed that jesus had actually risen /from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those /who believed. the followers of muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the koran says muhammad performed. they were attacked and slaughtered for their beliefs. they didn't denounce muhammad or islam. if you are correct, then that means islam is the true faith. you see how stupid your proofs are?

i told some friends of mine two weeks ago that koresh was dead. the fbi and the batf could not let a man like that live. he was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies. now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that koresh was crazy as a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us. they told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time. yet, whoever was watching the place failed to see that koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis. everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn't pick him up then. there are two possible answers. first, they didn't see him. what kind of survaillance is that? second, they didn't care. they wanted a confrontation. they wanted publicity and they got it. after the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming. they also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway. did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige? according to them they did, but according to the hartford courant, the woman that raised koresh (his grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him. the fbi agent who she spoke with was bob ricks and according to the paper he said: "a lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. his grandmother raised vernon howell; (koresh's real name) she didn't raise david koresh." someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level. there is also an emotional level on which they can reach you. here's another one. all during this operation the fbi has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done. now they claim they never thought he would do it? i knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing. that was the start of the "justification" part part of the plan. that's when i knew it would come soon. but, back to the plan. it is considered "cruel and unusal punishment" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable. they knew the parents (adults) had gas masks. they did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them. so the plan was to pour the gas into the compound. the mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with. i spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran i went through cbr (chemical, biological radiological) warfare training. part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to. to make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin. you think its on fire. i have no doubts the children would become hysterical. its not the kind of thing you never want to do again. this was the plan, the final solution. we waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from iran. we gave these people 51 days. i stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success. well, fbi agent ricks changed my mind. again a newclip from the hartford courant: "and while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt." it took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success. one more thought. the government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises. he had a license for the 50 caliber machine gun! they knew damn well he had one. they also knew he had it legally! still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. for all of this my president takes full responsibility. what a guy! i hope he gets it. in article <exuptr.1431.0@exu.ericsson.se>, exuptr@exu.ericsson.se (patrick taylor, the sounding board) writes: > in article <11974@prijat.cs.uofs.edu> bill@triangle.cs.uofs.edu (bill gunshannon) writes: > >>before you go absolving the batf & fbi of all blame in this incident, you should >>probably be aware of two important facts. >>1. there is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas. tear gas is non-breathable >> remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually >> by siezures and death. did the fbi know the physical health of all the people >> they exposed?? any potential heart problems among the b-d's?? > > no doubt it is dangerous stuff when concentrated. > >>2. have you ever seen a tear gas canister?? tear gas is produced by burning a >> chemical in the can. the fumes produced are tear gas. the canister has a >> warning printed on the side of it.

is it wrong now? did jesus change that? : if anything, he clarified the law such as in that quote you made. in the : following verses, jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon : the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended. sure he does this. however, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification. are you going to deny that deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?

i'll agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible from end to end and don't believe in it. depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary. they can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the bible. such pharisees include david koresh and adolph hitler. i will qualify this by saying *i don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening. however, just as scary are those that don't know much of the bible, but believe every word. in fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what i've seen. in addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people. : christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct. and it demands obedience to god's will. no, it demands obedience to a book. if god came down and personally told me how i should behave, then i would say that i would be doing god's will by doing it. however, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the ot), even if i follow everything in it with my heart, i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying i'm doing the will of god. : some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not. that is : their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too. well, if god respects it so much, how come there is talk in the bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?

why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to christians, why do *we*) want to find "commandments" in the books regarded as scripture? what's going on? i will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved? and it has been quoted "at" me often enough by those who don't believe i take it seriously, that jesus (is said to have) said, "if you love me, you will obey my commands." [john 14:15] i am, like any christian, the slave of christ, and it is my will that i should do as he wills me to do. i am (also, or instead) his younger brother, but still under his direction, though we both call god "abba." christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as "slaves of christ") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as "inspired" or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations. this practice ranges from "devotional" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as "the word of god." and at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as "absolute" guidance for our actions. the problem is in finding out just *what* it is our lord commands. i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians have looked for these commands, namely christian tradition. that is not because *i* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of scripture. the question i want to deal with is, what commandments can we find from our lord in scripture? and that turns out to be a hard question. [ if any of my protestant inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, i can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* protestants, episcopalians admit claims from a) scripture b) reason and c) tradition on roughly equal standing. ] earlier in john than my quote above, we read [john 13:34] "i give you a new commandment: love one another." this is the only place in the nt where christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus. at the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in john, but in the synoptics] jesus says, "take this [bread]; this is my body." [mark 14:22, cf. matthew 26:26, luke 22:19, 1 corinthians 11:24] the mode is imperative (greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a "commandment." in *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord. in the case of communion, paul's mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to "bind" christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the christian community. i am entirely comfortable with this inference, but i *must* point out that it is there, between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command. i take it as a clear inference, at the very least the evangelist's notion, that *all* christians are called to love one another, in jesus' command directed at the disciples. but i have to call attention to the inference. the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a "disciple" of christ. all reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever. this is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when english misleads us.) i am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ i don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ] i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in. questions at that level only introduce more reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done. among the reasons we have for seeing john's _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the synoptic "great commandment" is that we have criticism, from jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with. in matthew 5:43ff we read, "you have learnt how it was said: 'you must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. but i say to you: love your enemies." in fact, the leviticus context quoted does not say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (and leviticus is at pains to say that the "love" should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel.) luke, in expanding on this same q context, goes on to have jesus say. "even sinners love those who love them." [6:27] all of this suggests [quite strongly, i'd say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the "new commandment" is not quite what jesus has in mind. in short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is "in force" on christians, and with objects not limited to other christians. trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or institution of communion, there is the case of the "great commission" where (matthew 10, mark 6) the twelve are sent out to evangelize, "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand." the verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in "do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any samaritan town" -- the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus' final journey to jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples. that hasn't prevented christians from making such an inference; what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases i cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader. still, paul seems to have felt obliged to "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand" even (contrary to jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth. so, christians after him have also taken this as a "commandment" in the sense of john 14:15. do i "accept" this? i don't know. it is surely rather speculative. but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion. i do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but i *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture. there are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to "justify" their assumptions by other references to scripture -- which simply adds more inference into the mix!) let's move on to the "great commandment" -- that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls. this is, perhaps, the synoptic "equivalent" of john's _agapate allelou_. and yet, it is not presented as a commandment, in our texts. rather, the context is controversy with the pharisees. to cite matthew [22:34ff] 	"but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees 	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, 	"master, which is the greatest commandment of the law?" it is by no means obvious here (though i accept it as such) that jesus' answer is meant to be a commandment *to christians*. he is answering a polemic from his enemies. [ mark's account, in 12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the "scribe" in this version says) "far more important than any holocaust (i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the nazis for this) or sacrifice." luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question "to disconcert" jesus, and gets the good samarian parable for his pains [ luke 10:25-37 ]. the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-) in *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians -- though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so. the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do, by jesus. and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus' use of the torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*. the different contexts among the synoptics are curious. it should be noted that only in luke do we get the "fixing" of this command by the parable of the good samaritan. we may look for an analogous *intent* in matthew, where 7:12 gives the "golden rule" as "the meaning of the law and the prophets" (and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same, a generation before jesus.) if we make these associations (which i think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference. the texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship. current literary theory calls this "intertextuality." my discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ "has" to apply beyond the community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a "commandment" to christians. few christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but i *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts, themselves. the contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as commandments. and we get some really hard cases. take divorce. mark is pretty clear, "the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her." [ 10:11, cf. luke 16:18 ] -- except that matthew has an escape clause [ "except in the case of fornication", 5:31 ]. this seems to be a rather clear "commandment" (whether or not we take matthew's reservation); and some christians, to this day, take it so. but some don't, at least in practice. this is rather peculiar; it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this (whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.) how is it possible, if the commands of christ are clear, that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition? i'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with. the theme is: "finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by our assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases." i have, so far, identified a very few "commandments" that are generally accepted by all christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface. it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic. the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that us law refuse to allow it, or refuse "unrepentant divorcees" places in their churches. [ that is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most "liberal" church circles. for example, a (wildly) liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a "private" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the "public" ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing "examination" by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as christians. this, in a church that was effectively created by a famous divorce! ] -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7

	would someone be kind enought to document the exact nature of the evidence against the bd's without reference to hearsay or newsreports. i would also like to know more about their past record etc. but again based on solid not media reports. 	my reason for asking for such evidence is that last night on larry king live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed from australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the original raid. this admission, if true, raises the nasty possibility that the government acted in good faith, which i believe they did, on faulty evidence. it also raises the possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising them and giving ver poor advice. 	a few years ago anson shupe and david bromley published strange gods: the great american cult scare (beacon, boston, 1981 - and the new vigilantes: anti-cultists and new religions -sage, beverly hills, 1980. both books suggested the possibility of tragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever taken seriously. perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movement needs investigating in light of the waco tragedy.

[that may also be true of non- christians -- i am not claimng otherwise]. in the "moment of silence" it would still be difficult for the jews to gather and daven, for the muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to mecca and engage in the prescribed forms. but *of course* christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that. luckily, there *is* a strong jewish presence in this country (and i, as a christian, revere some of the jewish teachers i had in public schools), and a growing muslim presence as well. i can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will prevent the imposition of christian forms on non-christians. as far as i can see (as a christian) there is nothing in this "moment of silence" campaign but an attempt to use public social pressure to force children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards christianity. and as a christian, i *must* protest such coercion. for what it's worth, i suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-christians -- it is yet another case of failure amongst christian parents in "making" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what they cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so. if you have taught your children to pray, they do not need a moment of silence in school. if you have not managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you. give it up. -- michael l. siemon		i say "you are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com			most high, all of you; nevertheless - or -			you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com		like any prince." psalm 82:6-7

however, this is even more confusing because >i even admit that i don't like the situation where i'm not >informed. black and white. a spade is a spade. there is no hidden agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one. it is an easy and as straight forward as it reads. kent, i am not accusing you of evil things. jesus is accusing you. and it is not only you that he is accusing. he is accusing everyone. me, you and everyone in the world is guilty. whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil things. we do them regardless. jesus uses the word "men". i am included. jesus is not soloing you out. jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. christians are not immuned from doing evil things. a christian is just a person in whom the holy spirit indwells. a christian can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light. jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the christian will stop doing evil. if you haven't seen jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the his light. you may shed some light on your own. your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela. but the holy spirit shines at a megacandela. the holy spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know existed. so do you see jesus's point? christians are not perfect. nonchristians are not perfect. nonchristians do not want to come into the light of jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight. it is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from jesus's perspective. do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are? do you think brian kendig wants to know? do you think i want to know? ego verses the truth, which do you choose? >i'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made >sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight >into the light. i don't think the world is that simple. and if >you act in such ways when you are enlighted, then i'm a happy >man and i pray i will never receive such 'light'. and i watched koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion. it is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death. and kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up koresh--as if koresh actually had truth in him. david koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real jesus christ. david koresh, who claimed to be jesus, was a fraud. it was obvious. david koresh was born in america. jesus was born in bethlehem. koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that. jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times. david koresh wasn't anything new to jesus. jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago. so the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be jesus. ask the obvious. where were you born? was your mother's name mary? if the branch davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled koresh a liar right from the start. the wouldn't have followed koresh. they wouldn't have died. but look what happened. their ignorance cost them their lives. their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot. kent, since you studied the bible under lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic satan used to try to tempt jesus? did not satan quote the bible out of context? do you remember what tactic the serpent of genesis used to tempt eve? did he not misquote god? what satan used on eve and succeeded, was the same ploy he tried on jesus. but in jesus's case, jesus rebuked satan back with the bible _in_ context. it didn't work with jesus. does what satan did to eve in the garden and what satan tried to do with jesus in the desert remind you of what koresh did to his followers? who did koresh emulate? who was koresh's teacher? koresh did to his followers what satan did to eve. did not koresh kill his followersr? did not satan cause adam and eve to die as well? did not the cult followers believe koresh even though they knew the real christ was born in bethlehem? did not eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death? god held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller. none of them had an excuse. as opposed to the branch davidians, we have a second chance. follow jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life. don't follow jesus, and you stand condemned already, for like the branch davidian complex, your house is already on fire. satan, adam and eve have already set it ablaze. it is just a slow burn, but it is burning nevertheless.

as far as utah is concerned, what i pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have brought death, disease, (i.e. the "downwinders") and environmental contami- nation. i am hardly "paranoid," i am just not "expecting" too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed (as gov. boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us. as a matter of fact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global) persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that (paraphrasing) "all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to zion." zion (the "pure in heart") will be re-established in those days, and it ain't our current secular authorities who will rule over it... #>... david koresh did not pose a great #>threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with #>john, i too wonder who or what's next... # #i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the #life of even one person. sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of #this nation. but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers. that #much is definite. hmmm.

welcome to the peace run you're invited to join in a global relay run... and help light the way. ---- why the peace run ---- there's a new spirit in the nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing belief in the possibility of true global peace. the goal of the sri chinmoy oneness-home peace run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives. every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming peace torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind. each person who holds or runs with the peace torch lights a path for those who follow. each time the peace torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth. 		 ---- making history ---- the three peace runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the middle east, a landmark run crossed the egyptian- israeli border; in europe, a precedent-setting run linked eastern and western europe with russia; in the united states, mexico and canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in poland, the peace torch was blessed by pope john paul ii. 		 ---- speaking as one: world ---- ---- leaders, celebrities - and you ---- the peace run has won the support of leaders the world over - presidents, prime ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities. its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and tv broadcasts, including specials on pbs, mtv and nbc's today show. > "i am happy to support your peace run for justice, peace and reconciliation. the world must know that god wants us to live amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human family, god's family." - archbishop desmond tutu, 			 nobel peace prize winner 		 ---- how it all works ---- peace run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in new york city on saturday april 17, converging at various points to lead up to the opening ceremony outside the united nations dag hammarskjold building. there, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the peace torch. from there, peace torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the united states, canada, japan, australia, russia and eastern and western europe. smaller runs will take place in the philippines, mexico, israel, south america, egypt and elsewhere in africa. distance to be covered: 31,000 miles. >"the peace run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear about the event." - carl lewis, six-time olympic gold medalist ---- who's behind it ---- the peace run is sponsored by the sri chinmoy marathon team, an international running organization that believes sports can be a powerful instrument for promoting world peace. each year the team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries. the peace run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador sri chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony. the run is managed by peace runs international, a non-profit organization based in the united states. ---- take a step for peace ---- the peace runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. we're expecting even more people to join peace run '93. you can also join the run - carrying the peace torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the torch through your community. you can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the 70-nation route. your inner support is important too. if you're a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace. 		 ---- the next step is yours ---- 		 ---- make it one for peace ---- for information contact: peace runs international 161-44 normal road jamaica, ny 11432 usa tel. 718/291-6637 fax: 718/291-6978 peace run canada 2456 agricola street halifax, nova scotia b3k 4c2 tel. 902/425-1174 fax: 902/420-0773 or for the phone number or address of a peace run office in your town or country, reply to this message by e-mail.

[emphasis mine]". scholars sometimes do not even mention the two josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus. so far as i can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. i don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?). biblical scholars as i defined them include theologians and historians. the former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology. so the distinction is blurred. i didn't elaborate on that. sorry. (in turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology). can't say about the number of copies. these were, however, bg times (before gutenburg). a hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one hand seems more reasonable. perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed. such a practice is certainly not foreign to religions. anyway, all we have are mss. which have the two entries. lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an arabic ms. but here the ms. date is critical. :-) rich fox, anthro, usouthdakota

(b) 60mph to someone stationary next to the train. the reference frame makes the speed relative. but what's interesting here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet. every person off, a bullet moving 60mph. i know of no train where all the people on it, every time it is filled, will see a moral problem in exactly the same way. -- jim halat halat@bear.com bear-stearns --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you-- nyc i speak only for myself

there has been a lot of discussion about tyre. in sum, ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that ezekiel was not literally correct. this doesn't bother me at all, because i understand the language ezekiel used differently than do so-called biblical literalists. for example, it sometimes happens that someone says "my grandson is the cutest baby!" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says "oh! isn't she the cutest thing!?" this person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first. rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented. because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true. for those people, the existence of tyre is a problem; for me, it is not. turning to the latest person trying to defend ezekiel, we read this from john e king: > the prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the > area[.] no, it implies nothing of the kind. if you had nothing but the prophecy from ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say "oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that." you would read "i will make you a bare rock" and "you will never be rebuilt", and you'd conclude that tyre would be a bare rock. the only way to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population' is if you know that all that latter stuff is there. in other words, your answer means that ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written. there is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude "medium-size city". you seem to feel that "never be rebuilt" means "be rebuilt" -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication'. mr king also writes: > so far i've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000. > let's assume the latter one is correct. by modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town. well, no. that's only a bit less than the population of annapolis, where i'm from. you know, the naval acadamy, the state capital, george washington resigned his commission in the statehouse? annapolis may not be new york, but it's at least a two-horse town. but supposing 22,000 people is a "small town" -- it's still 22,000 people more than ezekiel predicted. and you've said nothing about the other problem. in chapter 26, ezekiel predicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all their valuables. however, nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre, and in chapter 29 ezekiel even quotes god as saying "he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against tyre." let's ignore alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. ezekiel says n. would destroy tyre, and n. did not destroy tyre. ezekiel says that n. would plunder their valuables, but n. did not plunder their valuables. regardless of what you think about tyre _now_, the fact is that n. died before the place was destroyed. ezekiel said n. was going to do it, and n. did not. * this post is, of course, pointless. inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say. for example, i expect mr king to respond to the comments about ezekiel 26 by pulling some "clear implications" out of hat. when ezekiel said that n. would "demolish your towers", that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be. and when ezekiel said that n. would "demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea", that clearly implied that n. would never set foot on the island. and when ezekiel wrote that n. would "build a ramp up to your walls", that clearly implies that n. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls. see? a few "clear implications" that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu "[do] you know why i'm the enabler? because you demand it!" -- cliff claven

[24] therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ, that we may be justified by faith. [25] but now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. [26] for you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus. i believe this says that after christ was revealed, the law had served it's purpose, i.e. "our tutor to lead us to christ," and now, "we are no longer under a tutor." the law has been "fulfilled" as christ said he would do. god, the author of the old law, and the christ/man, jesus, are the same personality. therefore, the old law and the new testament (the "last will and testament" of jesus) are based on the same moral principles. it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are re-expressed in christianity. on the other hand, now that the law has fulfilled it's purpose and christians relate to god through christ, not the law, it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the "mysteries" of this new relationship. i.e. baptism representing christ's death, burial, and resurrection (rom. 6:3-8), the lord's supper as a memorial to his sacrifice (i cor. 11:26), and sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection (matt 28:1ff, acts 20:7) ok, that's one christian's explanation. i don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome other christians to offer other alternatives. please excuse the long posting. thanks for your interest if you have read this far... john nunnally nunnally@acs.harding.edu

my theory is that koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle and died on day 9 of the siege. on day 11 of the siege he rose from the dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the fbi over the next 40 days. living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy, as timmy baterman's father in *pet*sematary* could attest, so after 40 days they did what baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place to the ground. consistent with the facts, isn't it? did anyone actually *see* koresh between day 9 and day 11? -- david w. ash | "what profits a man if he keeps his eternal soul ash@sumex-aim.stanford.edu | when he could have lived life to the full and home: (415) 853-6860 | been forgiven at the end of it all anyway?" | --david merritt, a.k.a. the red shark

"christ" is greek for "messiah". "messiah" means "annointed one". "annoint" means "to rub with oil, i.e. to anoint; by impl. to consecrate" the major prophet daniel uses the word "messiah" in daniel chapter 9. how "closely" did you analyze the bible? looks as if you didn't get past the first word. so was the catalyst to break your faith the "priests" who interpreted the bible for you? did you ever do what the bereans did to paul's teachings in acts 17?
can a theist be truly objective? can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning? i've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about god and his scriptures. i've seen it in the christian, the jew, the muslim, and the other theists alike. all assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists, and with that belief search for their god. occasionally, the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion, but overall the majority keep to the belief that some "creator" was behind the universe's existence. i've known muslims who were once christians and vice versa, i've known christians who were once jewish and vice versa, and i've even known christians who become hindu. yet, throughout their transition from one faith to another, they've kept this belief in some form of higher "being." why? it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up. from the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the bible, the torah, the qur'an, & etc. he is told of this wondrous god who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophets talked about in the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc. he is also told that to question this (as children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against god, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture's truth is to damn one's soul to hell. thus, by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth" is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course. but it doesn't stop there. once the child is able to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the "right" readings of scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to explain away the unexplainable with "mystery." circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day. to doubt, of course, means wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns god. all of this has some considerable effect on the child, so that when he becomes an adult, the superstitions he's been taught are nearly impossible to remove. all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning god, hell, heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that god *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view? obviously, most theists can somewhat, especially when presented with "mythical gods" (homeric, roman, egyptian, & etc.). but can they put aside the assumption of god's existence and question it impartially? stephen _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ * atheist _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * libertarian _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ * pro-individuality _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * pro-responsibility _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ jr. * and all that jazz... --

(cf. "kermit" thread). on what ra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?" "orthodox" is a compound word. it comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). i use orthodox to refer to 'right teaching.' right teaching is derived from letting god speak to us through the bible. this can be from reading simple truths in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible. ra> who is that "holds that" luke meant what you said he meant? i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are pertinent. luke 23:43 records christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on an adjacent cross: "truly i say to you, today you will be with me in paradise." but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven? if christ himself was not in heaven until sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with him? the answer lies in the location of "paradise" when jesus died. apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day. jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and lazarus as "abraham's bosom," to which the godly beggar lazarus was carried by the angels after his decease (luke 16:19-31). thus "abraham's bosom" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed waited till the day of christ's resurrection. it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of hades (hebrew: sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary; or even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with the father. doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon. but on sunday, after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene (john 20:17) and her two companions (matthew 28:9), presumably he then took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise (including abraham, lazarus, and the repentant thief). we read in ephesians 4:8 concerning christ: "ascending on high, he led captivity captive; he gave gifts unto men." verse 9 continues: "but what does `he ascended' mean but that he also descended to the lowest parts of the earth?" -i.e., to hades. verse 10 adds: "he who descended is the same as he who ascended above all the heavens." presumably he led the whole band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven. ra> whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra> "look at the bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see biblical things differently from you? i think that this characterization is faulty. whenever my 'personal interpretation' is questioned, i usually give a reason. as for those that see things differently, please, put forward where there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one views the bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff that i glean from it. put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can have a discussion on that topic. but to decry something that i put forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious. ra> are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra> understands it? if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is wrong, then please, show me from scripture where it is wrong. simply stating that there are other views is not a proof. show it to me from scripture and then we can go on. ============================= robert weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

now some people happen not to like choice a. other people happen not to like choice c (paying for it, that is). c has been around and paid for for years. even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in conscience refuse to pay for it. now a has been around and is perfectly legal, but it hasn't been funded in the past. now a is going to be funded but some people object. they don't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice a. so we could refuse to fund a at all. then those women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice b or c, which will cost *all of us* more money. most of us don't see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some women. the alternative is to fund a if that is what the mother chooses. we will also still fund b and even c if *that* is what the mother chooses. however, some women will certainly choose a, and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend. your "taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your objections to it. (actually, your taxes are not really going to go down, as i'm sure you would point out. but the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another--like our massive debt.) >>if you disagree then give us some "reasons". given that abortion is >>*legal* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the >>population ... >>...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford >>them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you >>would force upon them. i refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice >>from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure. >what? >i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant. uncle bill doesn't pay for >breast augmentation, facelifts, etc... why abortions? it's elective >surgery! those other procedures you mention only cost money. there is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them.

"why do you call me good?" jesus answered. "no one is good-- except god alone." ken, the book of romans states that we are born sinners. we do not grow into being a sinner. we sin because we are sinners. the common mistake, even in christian circles, is to think the reverse true. so for as surely as you grew to look like you parents, you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature. it goes with being human. even though a new-born is innocent as can be, his sinful nature will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older. for as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth, he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling against mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation "no."

what an exciting thread (finally!) mitra is sanskrit for friend, as such he started out as an avatar of lord visnu mentioned first in the vedas. later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the persians. associated with the sun but not the sun, he is the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers. he was ordered by the sun to slay the bull of heaven and he reluct- antly agreed because of his obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life...then mitra and the sun sat down to eat. worship of lord mitra ended in persia with the ascension of the zoroastrians. hundreds of years later he was rediscovered and thrown into the official roman pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, i forget why. but all references of him ended abruptly when he was stricken from same, so apparently his worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership in the communist party was in the soviet bloc. the sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating! oh, his b-day was 25 dec. ahem. i am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after his was booted from the roman imperial god roster or what. it contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels of initiation. they worshipped underground in caverns in pews. the bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, i'm not sure that they had mithraic significance or not. i don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the christian masses. but eating deities goes way back to old kingdom egypt. someone mentioned bullfighting. did mithraists sacrifice bulls? i forget. more likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of cybele on the day of blood? cybele worship extended all throughout even up to france bigtime. ------- charles hope a54si@cunyvm a54si@cunyvm.cuny.edu government by reporters...media-ocracy.

burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go, given the waco bunch had other choices. but it reminded me of the russian old-believers who, thinking the antichrist was coming in 1666, grew frantic when peter the great started westernizing russia and reforming the russian church a few years later. they locked themselves in their churches and burned themselves alive by the thousands. are there other cases of apocalypse-obsessed christians resorting to self-imolation? is there a history of precedents? andrew.

actually if mr x had something to gain by his claims his account of the events would nmot be the most respected. case and point, the resurrection. by claiming that the resurrection actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many to christianity. however, if you read mathew 27:38 (?) and the case for the resurrected saints who walked around jerusalem and appeared to "many people" you would realize that other historians (josephus for one) would have reported on it all if it happened. the fact that the bible speaks of events of such great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only mean that the bible contains many made up stories.

russell turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues in his struggle with the christian texts and the christians. unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available. the lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity. also unfortunately (perhaps) i have a deadline in two weeks, the responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were. let me then say what i can, briefly. ----- >the two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are >so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning. this point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is pursued throughly in kaufmann, critique_of_religion_and_philosophy. >the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, >in part, as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if >he has "ultimate responsibility." this is a theological statement worthy of barth. dr turpin (dd) may wear the black robe of geneva yet! :-) >indeed, many traditions present >an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret >loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and >relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely >because it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimate >responsibility." once again, we are confronted with good sounding >goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. i wouldn't make that assumption; i don't think it is a reasonable assumption. >and who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"? there >are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward >reading show the christian god behaving in just this way. michael, and i, and others, read 'the bible' with christian glasses. among the things that this should imply is that the nt informs the ot, even to the point of dominanting it. some points in the ot (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly abrogated by the nt texts. to drive russell turpin's point with adequacy, one needs to begin with nt texts (probably from matthew, and probably about damnation) (just trying to help :-) ) this part is, i discover, what most moves me to post: mls> i am a "radical" christian *only* in that i take the gospel seriously. >no, michael, the conservative christians also take the gospel >seriously. what differentiates you is the way you interpret the >gospel. russell turpin's 'no' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. michael's self-description much govern. the equation of radical = liberal, which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong. radical conservatives are possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). thomas merton was a radical, even though conservative in some ways. st francis was a radical, similarly. how many examples are needed? mls> ... why don't i and the (myriads of) other christians like me mls> tell you something about christianity? ... michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) russell turpin (in an earlier post) had said that michael (michael's theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about christianity; dean simeon responds (this time gently): 'what do you mean?' more direct, perhaps, would have been: 'what could you possibly mean?' the implied rhetorical effort, to separate michael from the tradition, is a failure. michael is in the tradition. if your idea of the tradition doesn't include him, change your idea of the tradition! >the irony here is that there is *nothing* in christianity per >se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and >gays. how can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? i'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from michael) on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement. one verse is enough to refute it; i'll offer two, from paul (of all people): 'in jesus christ there is neither male nor female...'(galatians 3:28 {i don't quote single verses as a rule, and i don't carry them in my head}) and '*nothing* shall separate us from the glory of god...' (roughly, from romans). [if russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses, i'd promise to get the full context for any that he requires :-) :-)] >in short, it is the extra-christian principles that >make michael's christianity beneficial, and i suspect they would >be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by >christian interpretation. this conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the argument that goes before. a surprising logical ellipsis. dave davis, ddavis@ma30.bull.com these are my opinions & activities alone qotd: "wild beasts trapped in their cages are not so fierce as are the christians to each other." 					julian the apostate, c.361

petri and mathew, your discusion on the "reality" of atoms is interesting, but it would seem that you are verging on the question "is anything real": that is, since observation is not 100% reliable, how can we say that anything is "real". i don't think this was the intention of the original question, since you now define-out the word "real" so that nothing can meet its criteria. just a thought. brian /-|-\ ps rainbows and shadows are "real": they are not objects, they are phenomenon. an interesting question would be if atoms are objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo-quantum) or what?
recently, i've asked myself a rather interesting question: what right does god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ?? in his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live according to his rules, we will burn in hell. well, with what right can god make that desicion? let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). what then happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. well, i didn't ask to be created. let's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature (which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...? who is god to impose its rules on us ? who can tell if god is really so righteous as god likes us to believe? are all christians a flock of sheep, unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? hmmmmmmmmmmmm. i just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, i mean it. 		 	how should one deal with a man who is convinced that 		 	he is acting according to god's will, and who there- jokke		fore believes that he is doing you a favour by 		 	stabbing you in the back? 							-voltaire
930425 tony alicia writes: let's start with the name "rosicrucian". i took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a "rosicrucian" body and being *a* rosicrucian. so when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". at least that is what your observation suggests :-) response: this makes much sense to me. this is also true of most religions. there is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'hindus' or 'christians' or 'pagans' and actually *being* any of these. the social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'. i find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and huxley's 'perennial philosophy' is the great secret core of all mystical trads. :> tony: i'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in san jose, ca; this being the rc org with the most members (last time i looked). of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best". response: certainly true. i didn't know there were any groups which called themselves 'rosicrucians' that didn't associate with amorc. sure, i've heard all the hubbub about the golden dawn and rosae crucis in relation to all these western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'rosicrucians'. i'll admit my bias. i live in san jose. :> tony: "you'll have to trust me" when i tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by amorc, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, imho. response: this may be slightly off. i've met some of these rosicrucians and have a couple friends in amorc. the stories i've heard and the slight contact i've had with them does not give me the hope that i'd be received with any kind of warm welcome. i still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in deep pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'. tony: it is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be *non- sectarian*. response: i'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call themselves 'rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'. is this 'nonsectarian' like the masons, who require that a member 'believe in god by his/her definition'? tony: i don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing something divine"... and yes i don't like phrases like "eternal bliss" either! :-) response: let alone us *being* something divine. ;> tony: btw, i have read the intro letters of the lrc which they will mail you free of charge. response: addresses, phone numbers of groups? i'm into networking. thanks. | will \ | / love \\|// !! !! __\\|//__ \{}}}{{{}/ ____|___________|@@| "imagination is more important than knowledge." | | - albert einstein thyagi / \ nagasiva |(*)(*)| thyagi@houseofkaos.abyss.com \^^^^^^/ house of kaos -^^^^- 871 ironwood dr. ~~ san jose, ca 95125-2815 'fr.nigris' on divination web telnet seismo.soar.cs.cmu.edu 9393

"being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three-in-one god, it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah. some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten. as with their concept that god is a spirit, this misinformation about the gods of heaven is untrue. the fact is, and it too is attested by holy writ, that elohim is the father, and that jehovah is the son who was born into mortality as the lord jesus christ, the promised messiah. (promised messiah, p. 100) notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their "three-in-one god" and their belief that "god is a spirit" as they are in their understanding of who "elohim" and "jehovah" are. before examining mcconkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words "elohim" and "jehovah." mcconkie stated: "...the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in the old testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the exalted name-title jehovah. (promised messiah, p. 367) "_elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of god the eternal father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being god above all gods. (mormon doctrine, p. 224) agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who "elohim" and "jehovah" are, the apostle james e. talmage stated: "_elohim_, as understood and used in the restored church of jesus christ, is the name-title of god the eternal father, whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_ -- the only begotten in the flesh, jesus christ. (jesus the christ, p. 38) "a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve" apostles of the mormon church states that "god the eternal father...[is] designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'elohim'..." (articles of faith, p. 466) "...christ in his preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state...was known as jehovah..." (articles of faith, p. 471) today mormon leaders teach that "elohim" in the ot refers to god the father and "jehovah" refers to christ. mcconkie attacked christians for saying "jehovah" can refer to the father. he stressed that these two "name-titles" should not be changed around so that christ is called "elohim" and the father is called "jehovah." "...the father...is elohim, not jehovah.... jehovah is christ, and christ is jehovah; they are one and the same person." (promised messiah, p. 111) in the ot of the kjv of the bible, the hebrew word "elohim" is used to refer to the true god, false gods and goddesses, and the judges of israel. when referring to the true god, "elohim" is translated with a capital "g." when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel, it is translated with a small "g." it is translated four times as "judges" (exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as "judge" (1 sam. 2:25), twice as "mighty" (gen. 23:6; exod. 9:28), once as "angels" (ps. 8:5), once as "godly" (mal. 2:15), once as "great" (gen. 30:8), and once as "very great." (1 sam. 14:15) the word "jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word "adonai." many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh. however, since "jehovah" rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism, this section will also use "jehovah" instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name. "jehovah," unlike "elohim," is never used of false gods. it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible. in the kjv, "jehovah" is rendered primarily "lord," sometimes "god," and rarely "lord." now that we understand something about the words "elohim" and "jehovah" and their use by mormon leaders, we shall consider the apostle mcconkie's attack on christians for believing the father is "jehovah." in trying to prove that "jehovah" refers exclusively to christ, mcconkie cited several verses from the bible. some of these verses and mcconkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right. remember, mcconkie said the father is not "jehovah;" he is only "elohim." the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie's interpretation of ps. 110:1. of this verse he stated: "of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit and he testified, "the lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemies thy footstool?" (ps. 110:1.) two lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other. who are they and what message is contained in this messianic prophecy? "what think ye of christ?" our lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry. "whose son is he?" is christ the son of god or of someone else? is he to be born of a divine parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? that he was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the jews. and so they answered, "the son of david." david's son? truly he was. but he was more, much more. and so our lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture, asked, "how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemies thy footstool? if david then call him lord, how is he his son?" that is, if he is only the son of david, how is it that the great king, acting under inspiration, calls him lord and worships him as such? and we might add: _who is the other lord, the one who spake unto david's lord?_ can there be any question as to how jesus is interpreting the words of the psalm? he is saying that it means: '_the father said unto the son, elohim said unto jehovah_, sit thou on my right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever.' (promised messiah, pp. 101-102) (emphasis added) agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie, the following remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormons think of christ, p. 6 reads: "the lord [elohim, the father] said unto my lord [jehovah, the son]..." (brackets in original) mcconkie clearly stated that it is "elohim" the father who is speaking to "jehovah" the son in this psalm. however, when one looks at the hebrew word translated "lord," it becomes apparent that either the first "lord" is not the father or else the father is "jehovah." either way mcconkie is wrong. the psalm reads: "the lord [jehovah] said unto my lord [adon], sit thou at my right hand, until i make thine enemies thy footstool. (ps. 110:1) the first "lord" in this verse is "jehovah" who mormonism says is christ, not the father. the second "lord" is the hebrew word "adon" (singular for "adonai," meaning master or lord). if the first "lord" is the father and the second "lord" is the son, then the father is "jehovah" and the son is "adon." however, if the father is not "jehovah" as mcconkie claimed, then the first "lord" is "jehovah" the son, but who, then, is "adon?" obviously the father is "jehovah" in this psalm, and his son is "adon." another example involves isa. 42:6 about which mcconkie stated the following: "i the lord have called thee in righteousness," _isaiah quoted the father as saying of christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the gentiles." (isa. 42:6.) (promised messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added) mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads: "i the lord [jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the gentiles. (isa. 42:6) according to mcconkie, "i the lord" refers to the father, and "thine" and "thee" refer to christ. however, the "lord" who is speaking is "jehovah" which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is "jehovah." another example involves ps. 22:7-8. of these verses mcconkie stated: "the same psalm says: "all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him." (ps. 22:7-8.) _the fulfillment, as jesus hung on the cross_, is found in these words: "the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, he saved others; himself he cannot save. if he be the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. he trusted in god; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, i am the son of god. the thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (matt. 27:41-44.) (promised messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added) ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows: "all they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, he trusted on the lord [jehovah] that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as jesus hung on the cross." that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ. who, then, was the "lord" in whom he trusted? it was "jehovah" the father. another example involves ps. 31:13 and ps. 41:9. regarding them, mcconkie stated the following: "with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life." (ps. 31:13.) as to the role of judas in those conspiracies, the psalmist says: "mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (ps. 41:9.) (promised messiah, p. 532) apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ's "arrest and judicial trials." we shall first consider ps. 31 and then ps. 41. while mcconkie only quoted verse 13 of ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter. "for i have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. but i trusted in thee, o lord [jehovah]: i said, thou art my god [elohim]. (ps. 31:13-14) mcconkie said verse 13 referred to jesus christ. verse 14 goes on to tell that he (christ) trusted in the "lord" who is called his "god" or "elohim." mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is "elohim" the father. verse 14, however, reveals that the "elohim" of the man jesus is "jehovah" the father. in ps. 41, mcconkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses will be considered in this examination. "yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom i trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. but thou, o lord [jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that i may requite them. (ps. 41:9-10) mcconkie stated above that verse 9 referred to judas' role in christ's death. since it was judas who was the "familiar friend" who "lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "i," "my," and "me" in verse 9 must refer to christ. notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "lord" (jehovah). then the pronouns "me" and "i" which refer to christ are used again. that means christ was speaking to "jehovah" the father in these verses. another example involves mcconkie's following remark about ps. 110:4. "one of the great messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of david, says: "the lord hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek." (ps. 110:4.) (promised messiah, p. 450) mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ. the question is, what in this verse refers to christ? "the lord [jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek. (ps. 110:4) does the "lord," which is "jehovah," refer to christ? if mcconkie is right and jesus is "jehovah," but the father is not, then the "lord" would have to refer to christ. but who, then, is the one addressed as the "priest forever after the order of melchizedek?" the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ (heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the "lord" (jehovah) in ps. 110:4 is the father. another example involves isa. 53:4-12. of these verses mcconkie stated: "of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah, isaiah said... the _lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all.... it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him... (promised messiah, p. 234) (emphasis added) mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah." however, what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is "jehovah." verse 6 reads: "all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the lord [jehovah] hath laid on him [christ] the iniquity of us all," and verse 10 reads: "yet it pleased the lord [jehovah] to bruise him [christ]..." obviously the "lord" who laid on christ "the iniquity of us all" and who bruised him is god the father who is called "jehovah" in these verses. remember, mcconkie stated that "some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity," and that christ "came into mortality" as his "only begotten" son. he called this concept "misinformation" that is "untrue." to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth, two scriptural references (2 sam. 7:14; ps. 2:7) will be examined. mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures: "in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic, the lord says of the seed of david: "i will be his father, and he shall be my son." (2 sam. 7:14.) in the second psalm, the whole of which is also clearly messianic, occurs this statement: "thou art my son; this day have i begotten thee." (ps. 2:7.) paul quotes both of these statements in hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the son of god. (promised messiah, p. 143) mcconkie cited heb. 1:5 to show that 2 sam. 7:14 and ps. 2:7 refer to christ who "would come as the son of god." since mcconkie first referenced 2 sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. however, along with verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included. "and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. also the lord [jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house. and when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, i will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and i will establish his kingdom. he shall build an house for my name, and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. i will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2 sam. 7:11-14) these verses teach that the "lord" (jehovah) would have a son, the messiah. in the second example mcconkie cited ps. 2:7. this examination will include verse 8. notice that it is the "lord" (jehovah) who says, "thou art my son; this day have i begotten thee." "i will declare the decree: the lord [jehovah] hath said unto me, thou art my son; this day have i begotten thee. ask of me, and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. mcconkie said these verses of scripture are "clearly messianic," and he acknowledged they teach that "christ would come as the son of god." what he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these scriptures also teach that the father is "jehovah" and that the "sectarians" who believe "jehovah is the supreme deity whose son" is jesus christ, "the only begotten," are right in their belief. another example involves mic. 5:4. of this verse mcconkie stated the following: "and so, truly, did our lord act _during his mortal ministry! truly, this is he of whom it is written_: "he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord, in the majesty of the name of the lord his god... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." (mic. 5:4.) (promised messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added) according to mcconkie, the pronoun "he" at the beginning of mic. 5:4 refers to christ "during his mortal ministry." who, then, is the "lord his god?" mic. 5:4 reads: "and he [christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord [jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the lord [jehovah] his god [elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. obviously the "lord" of jesus christ is "jehovah" the father who is referred to as "jehovah his elohim." another example involves ps. 2:2 and isa. 61:1. of these verses mcconkie stated the following: "a number of messianic passages speak of "the lord, and...his anointed" (ps. 2:2), signifying that the chosen one was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting isaiah's prophecy. "the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (isa. 61:1), and then saying: "this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears" (luke 4:21). (promised messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added) the first source mcconkie quoted -- ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows: "the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the lord [jehovah], and against his anointed. mcconkie said the "anointed" one was christ. if that is true, who was "jehovah?" if "jehovah" is always christ, who was the "anointed" one? obviously "jehovah" is referring to god the father and the "anointed" is indeed referring to christ. the second source mcconkie cited is isa. 61:1 which states: "the spirit of the lord [adonai] god [jehovah] is upon me; because the lord [jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; the one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open was jesus christ. who, then, was the one who anointed him? this verse says the "lord" (jehovah) did the anointing. again, we face the same problem. if "jehovah" does not refer to the father, but only to christ, then jesus anointed someone, but who? as mcconkie pointed out, "jesus applied these passages to himself." therefore, the "jehovah" who anointed christ is god the father. other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not "jehovah." however, these should be enough to expose their error. now, what about mormonism's claim that jesus is "jehovah," but he is not "elohim?" it is true that jesus is "jehovah." the following scriptures prove this fact: "thus saith the lord [jehovah] the king of israel, and his redeemer the lord [jehovah] of hosts; i am the first, and i am the last; and beside me there is no god. (isa. 44:6) [jesus said] ...i am the first and the last: i am he that liveth, and was dead... (rev. 1:17-18) "...saith the lord [jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son... (zech. 12:1,10) behold, he [christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him... (rev. 1:7) "...i am the lord [jehovah] thy god, the holy one of israel... (isa. 43:3) ...ye denied the holy one [christ] and the just... (acts 3:14) "and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord [jehovah] shall be delivered... (joel 2:32) "...the name of jesus christ of nazareth...there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (acts 4:10,12) "behold, the lord god [jehovah] will come with strong hand...his reward is with him... (isa. 40:10) ...behold, i [christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (rev. 22:12) "...the lord [jehovah] my god shall come, and all the saints with thee. (zech. 14:5) "...at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints. (1 thess. 3:13) "the lord [jehovah] is my shepherd... (ps. 23:1) [jesus said] i am the good shepherd... (john 10:14) "...saith the lord god [jehovah]. i will seek that which was lost... (ezek. 34:15-16) ...the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. (luke 19:10) "for i am the lord [jehovah] thy god, the holy one of israel, thy saviour... (isa. 43:3) looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ. (tit. 2:13. see also jer. 42:5 and rev. 1:5; mal. 3:6 and heb. 13:8; 1 kin. 8:28,39 and john 2:24-25; isa. 25:8 and 2 tim. 1:10; ps. 107:24,29 and matt. 8:26; prov.3:12 and rev. 3:19) while mormons are right when they say jesus is "jehovah," they are wrong when they say he is not "elohim." the bible reveals that "jehovah" is the only true "elohim" there is; all others are false. remember, "jehovah" is the personal name of the triune god who has revealed himself in the bible. before we consider biblical quotes which show that "jehovah" and "elohim" are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as "jehovah" and "elohim" but so is the holy spirit. "whereof the _holy ghost_..._said_...this _is_ the covenant that i will make with them after those days, saith the lord, i will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will i write them; and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more. (heb. 10:15-17) (emphasis on "holy ghost" and "said" added) behold, the days come, _saith the lord_ [jehovah], that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel, and with the house of judah... i will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their god [elohim], and they shall be my people.... i will forgive their iniquity, and i will remember their sin no more. (jer. 31:31,33-34) (emphasis added) "for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the _holy ghost_. (2 pet. 1:21) (emphasis on "holy ghost" added) "the spirit of the lord [jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. (2 sam. 23:2. see also heb. 3:7-11 with ps. 95:6-11) let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that "jehovah" and "elohim" are not two separate gods as mormons claim. "and when the lord [jehovah] saw that he [moses] turned aside to see, god [elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, moses, moses. and he said, here am i.... [bruce r. mcconkie acknowledged that "it was" christ's "voice that spoke to moses in the burning bush..." promised messiah, p. 394] and the lord [jehovah] said... and moses said unto god [elohim], behold, when i come unto the children of israel, and shall say unto them, the god [elohim] of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, what is his name? what shall i say unto them? and god [elohim] said unto moses, i am that i am: and he said, thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel, i am hath sent me unto you. and god [elohim] said moreover unto moses, thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel, the lord [jehovah] god [elohim] of your fathers, the god [elohim] of abraham, the god [elohim] of isaac, and the god [elohim] of jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (exod. 3:4,7,13-15) "and god [elohim] spake unto moses, and said unto him, i am the lord [jehovah]. (exod. 6:2) "i am the lord [jehovah], and there is none else, there is no god [elohim] beside me: i girded thee, though thou hast not known me: (isa. 45:5) "but the lord [jehovah] is the true god [elohim], he is the living god [elohim], and an everlasting king... (jer. 10:10) "thus saith the lord [jehovah] the king of israel, and his redeemer the lord [jehovah] of hosts; i am the first, and i am the last; and beside me there is no god [elohim]. (isa. 44:6) "therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus, saith the lord [jehovah], whose name is the god [elohim] of hosts. (amos 5:27) "behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord's [jehovah's] thy god [elohim], the earth also, with all that therein is. (deut. 10:14) "wherefore thou art great, o lord [jehovah] god [elohim]: for there is none like thee, neither is there any god [elohim] beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 sam. 7:22) "and he said unto them, i am an hebrew; and i fear the lord [jehovah], the god [elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. (jon. 1:9) "for who is god [elohim] save the lord [jehovah]? or who is a rock save our god [elohim]? (ps. 18:31) "blessed is the nation whose god [elohim] is the lord [jehovah]... (ps. 33:12. see also ps. 144:15) "hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting god [elohim], the lord [jehovah], the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. (isa. 40:28) "the mighty god [elohim], even the lord [jehovah], hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. (ps. 50:1) "sing unto god [elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah, and rejoice before him. (ps. 68:4) [regarding the word "jah," bruce r. mcconkie stated: "jah (hebrew yah) is a contracted form of jehovah, jahveh, or yahweh -- all of which names have reference to christ, the god of israel." mormon doctrine, p. 391] "and david arose, and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah, to bring up from thence the ark of god [elohim], whose name is called by the name of the lord [jehovah] of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 sam. 6:2) "...the great the mighty god [elohim], the lord [jehovah] of hosts, is his name. (jer. 32:18) "o my god [elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.... fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, o lord [jehovah].... that men may know that thou, whose name alone is jehovah, art the most high over all the earth. (ps. 83:13,16,18) the bible clearly teaches that "jehovah" is "elohim." in fact, he is the only "elohim" there is. he is the "true," the "living," the "mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting elohim." he is the "elohim" of israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. he is the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon. "jehovah's" name is "elohim of hosts." (amos 5:27) not only is "jehovah," "elohim," but "elohim" is "jehovah." the bible reveals that "elohim's" name is "jah" (ps. 68:4), "jehovah" (ps. 83:18), and "jehovah of hosts." (2 sam. 6:2; jer. 32:18) the nation whose "elohim" is "jehovah" is blessed. (ps. 33:12) clearly, this is not the "jehovah" and "elohim" of the mormons. another mormon error regarding "elohim" and "jehovah" is the belief that "elohim," not "jehovah," is the father of all the spirits, including jesus. in the articles of faith by apostle james e. talmage, "a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve" apostles states that "god the eternal father...'elohim,' is the literal parent of...the spirits of the human race." (p. 466) this "doctrinal exposition" also states explicitly that "jesus christ is not the father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for he is one of them. he is the son, as they are sons and daughters of elohim." (p. 473) the apostle talmage stated that "_elohim_...is the name-title of god the eternal father, whose firstborn son in the spirit is _jehovah_--" (jesus the christ, p. 38) the apostle bruce r. mcconkie stated the following about this matter: "...jehovah-christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _but when it came to placing man on earth, there was a change in creators_. that is, the father himself became personally involved. all things were created by the son, using the power delegated by the father, except man. _in the spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the father_. there was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned." (promised messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added) mormon leaders claim that "jehovah-christ" did not create either man's spirit or his body. they maintain that the mormon "elohim," who is the father, created man both in spirit and body. the bible reveals the truth about who created man. "and moses spake unto the lord [jehovah], saying, let the lord [jehovah], the god [elohim] of the _spirits of all flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (num. 27:15-16. see also 16:20-23) (emphasis added) "...the lord [jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within him_. (zech. 12:1) (emphasis added) "...the lord [jehovah]...made us this soul... (jer. 38:16) "for i will not contend for ever, neither will i be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which i have made_.... ...saith the lord [jehovah]... (isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on "souls...i have made" added) "behold, i am the lord [jehovah], the god [elohim] _of all flesh_... (jer. 32:27) (emphasis added) "thus saith the lord [jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee from the womb_. i am the lord [jehovah] that maketh all things... (isa. 44:24) (emphasis added) "thus saith the lord [jehovah]... i have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (isa. 45:11-12) (emphasis added) "...god [elohim] created man upon the earth... unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the lord [jehovah] he is god [elohim]; there is none else beside him. (deut. 4:32,35) "thus saith god [el] the lord [jehovah]...he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (isa. 42:5) "...thus saith the lord [jehovah] of hosts, the god [elohim] of israel... i have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon the ground... (jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added) the bible reveals that it is "jehovah" who is the "elohim of the spirits of all flesh" and "of all flesh" itself, that it was he who "formed the spirit of man within him," that he "made us this soul" and "formed us from the womb." he did indeed "create man." if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is "jehovah," then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. if they are right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are wrong when they say he is not "jehovah." although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man, mormon scriptures teach that he did. the bom states the following: "behold, i am jesus christ. i am the father and the son.... and never have i showed myself unto _man whom i have created_, for never has man believed in me as thou hast.... behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and _man have i created_ after the body of my spirit... (eth. 3:14-16) (emphasis added) "for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _i that hath created them_... (mos. 26:23) (emphasis added) "...the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob...is that same god who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. behold _he created adam_... (mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added) d&c, 93:10 states that "the worlds were made by him [christ]; _men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him." (emphasis added) another error by bruce r. mcconkie involving "jehovah" and his creation is the belief that "jehovah" had "many" pre-mortal spirits helping him create. included in this alleged group was joseph smith, jr. "that he [christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by "many of the noble and great" spirit children of the father is evident from abraham's writings. unto those superior spirits christ said: "we will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (abra. 3:22-24.) michael or adam was one of these. enoch, noah, abraham, moses, peter, james, and john, joseph smith, and many other "noble and great" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (doctrines of salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (mormon doctrine, p. 169) the bible reveals the truth about this matter: "thus saith the lord [jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, i am the lord [jehovah] that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself. (isa. 44:24) "which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. (job 9:8) "jehovah," by himself, created all things. he had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting him. regarding the mormon 'elohim," the apostle mcconkie stated: "elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of god the eternal father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being god above all gods." (mormon doctrine, p. 224) he also stated that "jesus...is above all save the father only." (promised messiah, p. 363) the bible states that the one who is god above all so-called gods is the triune god "jehovah." "for the lord [jehovah] is a great god [el], and a great king above all gods [elohim]. (ps. 95:3) "for thou, lord [jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods [elohim]. (ps. 97:9) "now i know that the lord [jehovah] is greater than all gods [elohim]... (exod. 18:11. see also ps. 135:5; deut. 10:17) if mormon leaders are right when they say "jehovah" is god the son and "elohim" is god the father, these verses from the bible would be teaching that the mormon son is above his father. however, as mcconkie clearly stated, mormons believe "elohim" the father, not "jehovah" the son, is the "god above all gods" -- that jesus is above all except the father; yet the bible teaches that "jehovah" is above all "elohim." at a byu dev. on march 2, 1982, bruce r. mcconkie made the following remark about praying to jesus: "another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed.... this is plain sectarian nonsense. our prayers are addressed to the father, and to him only.... ...perfect prayer is addressed to the father, in the name of the son; it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost... (our relationship with the lord, pp. 19-20) mcconkie states on p. 335 of his book promised messiah that the mormons "pray to the father, not the son..." on p. 306 of the same book mcconkie states that "christ [the son] is jehovah." this is important to remember, because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to the mormon christ who is "jehovah," the bible states repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to "jehovah," and he not only heard those prayers, but he accepted them as valid requests. the following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to "jehovah." "in my distress i called upon the lord [jehovah], and cried unto my god [elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. (ps. 18:6) "and the lord [jehovah] said unto him, i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: i have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 kin. 9:3) "and said unto jeremiah the prophet, let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the lord [jehovah] thy god [elohim], even for all this remnant... (jer. 42:2) "o lord [jehovah], i beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name... (neh. 1:11) "and it was so, that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord [jehovah], he arose from before the altar of the lord [jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. (1 kin. 8:54) "he went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the lord [jehovah]. (2 kin. 4:33) "go, and say to hezekiah, thus saith the lord [jehovah], the god [elohim] of david thy father, i have heard thy prayer, i have seen thy tears: behold, i will add unto thy days fifteen years. (isa. 38:5) "i acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have i not hid. i said, i will confess my transgressions unto the lord [jehovah]; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found... (ps. 32:5-6) notice above in ps. 32:6 that the "godly" pray to "jehovah." according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders, that is christ the very one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray. the bible reveals there is only one true "elohim," and his name is "jehovah." all other "elohim" are false. they are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true "elohim" and idolatry. "for the lord [jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods [elohim]. for all the gods [elohim] of the nations are idols: but the lord [jehovah] made the heavens. (ps. 96:4-5) "thou shalt have no other gods [elohim] before me. (exod. 20:3) "now i know that the lord [jehovah] is greater than all gods [elohim]... (exod. 18:11) "and it shall be, if thou do at all forget the lord [jehovah] thy god [elohim], and walk after other gods [elohim], and serve them, and worship them, i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. (deut. 8:19) "thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [elohim]. they shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods [elohim], it will surely be a snare unto thee. (exod. 23:32- 33) "take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods [elohim], and worship them. (deut. 11:16) "that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods [elohim], nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them. (josh. 23:7) "...neither walk after other gods [elohim] to your hurt. (jer. 7:6) "but the lord [jehovah] is the true god [elohim], he is the living god [elohim]... (jer. 10:10) "and they forsook the lord [jehovah] god [elohim] of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of egypt, and followed other gods [elohim], of the gods [elohim] of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the lord [jehovah] to anger. (jud. 2:12) "shall a man make gods [elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods [elohim]? therefore, behold, i will this once cause them to know, i will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is the lord [jehovah]. ( jer. 16:20-21) "and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord [jehovah], choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [elohim] which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods [elohim] of the amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the lord [jehovah]. and the people answered and said, god [elohim] forbid that we should forsake the lord [jehovah], to serve other gods [elohim]. (josh. 24:15-16) these verses teach that the only true, living "elohim" in heaven and on earth is "jehovah" -- the triune god who made heaven and earth and all therein. "jehovah" is greater than any "elohim," because all other "elohim" are idols. the reality behind them is demonic. (deut. 32:17) "jehovah elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false "elohim." he told his people not to have any "elohim" but him. he told the people that if they left him for the false "elohim," those "elohim" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. he warned the people to "take heed" that their "heart be not deceived" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making covenants with false "elohim." "jehovah elohim" told his people he would eventually judge all false "elohim" and their followers. despite these warnings and guidelines, "elohim's" covenant people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false "elohim's" of the people they came in contact with. ju. 10:6 states that "the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord [jehovah] and served baalim, and ashtaroth, and the gods [elohim] of syria, and the gods [elohim] of zidon, and the gods [elohim] of moab, and the gods [elohim] of the children of ammon, and the gods [elohim] of the philistines, and forsook the lord [jehovah], and served not him." this examination has shown that the "elohim" of mormonism, like the "elohim" in ju. 10:6 is not the true "jehovah elohim." therefore, the people who leave the true "elohim" for the mormon "elohim" will do "evil...in the sight of the lord [jehovah]." although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father [jehovah] sent his son into the world, these beliefs are true. god is triune; he is spirit; he is "jehovah;" and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind. it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who "thrash around in...darkness" about who "elohim" and "jehovah" are. one wonders what "holy writ" mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that "elohim is the father, and that jehovah is the son." he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches that the father, son, and holy spirit are all the one "jehovah elohim." he apparently did not mean the d&c either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the father as "jehovah." summary obviously joseph fielding smith's statement that the mormons "have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god" (doctrines of salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. the mormon gods are not the true god as mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against god and idolatry. in answer to jesus' question, "but whom say ye that i am," mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in the bible and whom the apostles preached. therefore, anyone trusting in the mormon jesus is believing in "another jesus" whom paul warned about. bernard p. brockbank, of the first quorum of the seventy, admitted in the may 1977 issue of the ensign, a mormon publication, that the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus. he stated that "it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints." (p. 26) the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing adultery against god and idolatry. they do not have the son; therefore, they do not have the father, and they do not have eternal life. as the apostle bruce r. mcconkie rightly stated: "salvation comes only by worshiping the true god." (promised messiah, p. 163) mcconkie also rightly stated that "the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living god," because the "true names of deity" can be applied to "false concepts of god." (mormon doctrine, p. 270) remember that the apostle stephen l. richards admitted that joseph smith, jr., gave "a new conception of god and the godhead." (contributions of joseph smith, p. 1) it is important for the people who have left the true triune god revealed in the bible to repent and return to him. they must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism. the bible says: "...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the lord [jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (jer. 17:13) "and it shall be, if thou do at all forget the lord [jehovah] thy god [elohim], and walk after other gods [elohim], and serve them, and worship them, i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. (deut. 8:19) "thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [elohim]. (exod. 23:32) "...put away the strange gods [elohim] that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments. (gen. 35:2) "...flee from idolatry. (1 cor. 10:14) it is necessary that christians heed the warnings of the bible. if they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against god and idolatry. remember, to know the "only true god" is eternal life. (john 17:3) "...their gods [elohim] shall be a snare unto you." (ju. 2:3. see also exod. 23:32-33)

in article <1746.2bd37a66@paranet.fidonet.org> bill.carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.fidonet.org (bill carlson) writes: > since everywhere i look, zoroaster is suggested as being a probable > descendant of daniel; suppose you prove he wasn't. zoroaster is far older than daniel. if anything, one could claim that, in a sense, daniel is a descendant of zoroaster; as daniel, though being hebrew, has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism. [however, the majority of the book is in hellenistic aramaic (not babylonian aramaic) and only has kethuvim or writing status.] ref: encyclopedia of religion, mircea eliade: daniel, or, in hebrew, daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion's pit. he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy. as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (ez. 14:4,28:3). the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in hebrew, whereas daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in aramaic. the language division parallels the subject division (daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported (dn. 7-12). much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, daniel 4 speaks of nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus; belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon, although he was never king; and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia, although no such darius is known (the medes followed the persians, and darius is the name of several persian kings). presumably the episodes of daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century bce) in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith. the visions of daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii (but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine), were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 bce) that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment, with a "son of man" invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in daniel 9-12. the imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages. the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel, the scientist isaac newton, and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent. the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful. neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. the themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour. zarathushtra, founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism (from mazda or ahura mazda, the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra.) the etymology and history of zarathushtra, the avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in various iranian languages and in related forms else- where. there may have been an old persian form, zara-ushtra, from which the greek form, zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an old iranian form, zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht, several middle persian forms (such as zrtwsht), and the new persian zardusht. we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra, means "camel." the form zoroaster, derived from the greek zoroastres, was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century, when zarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta, the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in iranian philology. [see avesta.] notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra, even in western culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented, and heterogeneous. our principle sources are the five gathas ("songs"), attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta: gatha ahunavaiti (yasna 28-34), gatha ushtavaiti (yasna 43-46), gatha spentamainyu (yasna 47-50), gatha vokukhshathra (yasna 51), and gatha vashishtoishti (yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the prophet's death. other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce. although the achaemenid inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures bce) never mention zarathushtra, he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time (not, however, by herodotus, who seems unaware of him). the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra. but the text is useful in an indirect way, as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians. the greek sources, on the other hand, do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra, although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. some place him six thousand years before the trojan war (xanthus of lydia, eudoxus of cnidus, hermippus, hermodorus, aristotle, plutarch, diogenes laertius, and pliny). the account by xanthus of lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of xerxes against greece. this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius, who makes reference to xanthus, but although a few scholars (a. s. shabazi, helmut humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it is generally rejected. although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible, they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period, as the above account would seem to demonstrate. they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an extremely distant past. all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close to, that of the achaemenids. later zoroastrian sources, the pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono- logy for zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some arab authors. accord- ing to these sources, zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before alexander. again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification. the most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. the figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination. for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. in this context, zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos, converted vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and vishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium (thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before alexander). given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great, cambyses, and darius, as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce. nor is there any mention of the history of that period, which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance. at the same time, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be justified. consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate. as to zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern iran. some have held that he was a mede, largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language of the avesta. this hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on historical and linguistic grounds, that zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precisely from which region. there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia, or present-day khorezm, or from a wider chorasmian region, reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat. most likely, however, zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia (modern qandahar), as well as drangiana (the area of lake helmand). it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran. zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (yasna 33.6). he was a zaotar (cf. sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry. even in the so-called younger avesta he is described as an athravan (yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste. to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used to lend dignity (as in the gathas) to the contents of his new message, the product of a great and original ethical mind. zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking india to iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan, or "possessor of asha," that is, the one who, as in the vedic rtavan, seeks truth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death. any good follower of such teachings seeks the "vision of asha," just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the "vision of the sun," a manifestation of rta. behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of "aryan mysticism," that is, of indo-iranian mysticism. zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition. rather, it lies in the innovation and strength of his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic monotheism (the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the evil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (av., frashokereti; pahl., frashgird) of life and existence. [see frashokereti] both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra's teachings from the indo-iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing. they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil. because of his basic tenets, zarathushtra, who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures. another original facet of zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy to understand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas, is the doctrine of the amesha spentas, the "beneficent immortals." these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [see amesha spentas.] other than the names of his father, pourushaspa ("possessing gray horses"), and of his mother, dughdova ("one who has milked"), we know almost nothing of zarathushtra's life. a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers. according to tradition, zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision. only after ten years had passed, however, did he succeed in converting a cousin of his, maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices. this hostility caused him to leave his region (yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife, hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two years old. we also know the name of a son, isat vastra ("desiring pastures"), and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more sons, urvatatnara ("commanding men") and hvarecithra ("sun-faced"), born of his second wife, hvovi, a member of the influential hvogva ("possessing good cattle") family. two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned: frashaoshtra and jamaspa, the former as hvovi's father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, pouruchista ("very thoughtful"), whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas (yasna 53). again, according to tradition, zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. he was assassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres (his name is known only in the pahlavi form). the paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi- tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities. the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard, a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce, as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century, the zarathusht-nama (book of zarathushtra), written by zaratusht-i bahram-i pazhdu. mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man. zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment. during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an "alien wisdom," a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself, and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism. earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the biblical prophets, the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem. [see magi.] this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant, the savior of the future. [see saoshyant.] later, however, religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia (third to seventh centuries ce), which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire. zarathushtra's popularity in the christian world began to decline. the iranian prophet, who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture and heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. but during the renaiss- ance and the enlightenment, european cultures reverted to the image of zara- thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity. he was viewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _chaldean oracles_ and probably inventor of qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism, and, at times (as in voltaire), as a symbol of non-christian wisdom. after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, friedrich nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work _also sprach zarathustra_ (1883- 1892). nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between good and evil.

(to live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.) we believe that all of god's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn. one-third chose for lucifer's plan, most followed the firstborn (the pre-mortal jesus christ). lucifer's aspirations ("i will exalt my throne above the stars of god . . ." isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the firstborn and those who followed him, resulting in the casting out of lucifer (who became satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven ("and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . ." revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits). to get back on our choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to god and his plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually. (god speaking to job: "where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of god shouted for joy?" job 38:4-7). we lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "veil of forgetful- ness," somewhere in psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight. you may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of god. #who is god to impose its rules on us ? who can tell if god is really so #righteous as god likes us to believe? are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #hmmmmmmmmmmmm. (all christians, by definition, are a flock of sheep, following the shepherd as they understand him ;-) --but in any event, not all christians believe in the same theology, such as the one latter-day saints believe in. (they will cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines of the bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself bible-study manuals...) as for me, i have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with biblical doctrine, some dead sea scroll books, the pseudographion, other (jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject. #i just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, i mean it. # # how should one deal with a man who is convinced that # he is acting according to god's will, and who there- # jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by # stabbing you in the back? # # -voltaire casper c. knies isscck@byuvm.bitnet brigham young university isscck@vm.byu.edu ucs computer facilities

let me begin by saying i think this is the world's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium. therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common. the basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in genesis and exodus but assume that the bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct. for example, story of adam and eve: adam and eve are in garden of eden naked and ignorant. have unlimited supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge. god says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge. they do anyway, then try to hide in bushes. god finds them and forces them out of garden. (there are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered god.) traditional philosophy: 1. the only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat. if someone else will provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's ok. this is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades. 2. authority figures, such as god, whoever was behind the vietnam war, hitler and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves. interpretation of events based on traditional philosophy: they were not supposed to eat the fruit. they should have done whatever god told them to. like small children, they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their "father" said to. being forced to leave the garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment. lessons from traditional interpretation: 1. ignorance is good. knowledge is bad, but tempting. 2. having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is ideal. get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment. 3. public nudity is good. covering up is bad. 4. authority figures are intrinsically right. normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without question. they should not think for themselves. 5. people in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning. for example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read. 1990's philosophy: 1. people should seek education and employment outside the home, unless named "hillary clinton" or "murphy brown". 2. people should use common sense. they should not kill other people (binding of issac, wars, holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to. interpretation of events based on current philosophy: they were supposed to eat the fruit. god gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter. once they had gained knowledge and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were rewarded by being allowed into the "real world." lessons from new interpretation: 1. ignorance is bad. knowledge is good, but must be sought. 2. having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is at best a temporary measure. getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3. public nudity is bad. covering up is good. 4. authority figures are often wrong. normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and "alter or abolish" bad governments. they should think for themselves. 5. people in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway, and all the harder. for example, poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves). i have tentatively named this new philosophy "the church of eveism" because eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead of its first bad one, as traditionally believed. she is therefore clearly a protagonist. god at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist. as god rewarded the decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it until it was actively sought. ---end serious discussion. begin humor.-- save this post to disk (or file server). someday it will be considered the most important writing since the 10 commandments. you want an original copy. stay tuned for the rfd on soc.religion.eveism... can i get a tax deduction for money i donate to this organization? --return to serious discussion when posting follow-ups.-- stephen weinstein weinss@rpi.edu

i can point to > definite things she's done for me, and i can even just bring her to > you so you can ask her, face-to-face. > you say your deity loves you. how do you know, i ask? bingo. for god so loved the world, he gave his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life. i look what god *did*. he has given his son, even to his death, so that i can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has glorious purpose. > you can't even convince me that it exists! because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history. you choose to lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years. you sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the lazarus of jesus's story starting in luke 16:19. and the conclusion of that story is a bleak one. lazarus wound up in hell. the story ends like this: "for if lazarus doesn't even listen to moses and the prophets, he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead." > if any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold > pleasures to me if i'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my > rationality for just this once, then i would choose 'hell'. i can > *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful > it is. arrogance at its best. the fact is, you are not rational. several specific cases have already been cited. and again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven. jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven. jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him. jesus does not expect you to placate either. jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches. why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself. you maintain you have an open mind. see whether you are lying to yourself for yourself. >>why would you want to live a good life? >>to you, you die and that's it. don't contradict yourself. you have >>no reason to live a good life. it doesn't do you any good in the >>end. your life doesn't do anybody else any good either because >>everyone dies anyway. so you have no reason to lead a good life. leading >>a good life is meaningless. why do you do such a meaningless thing? >that paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word >i've said. i do understand what you said. but that's is not what i feel went amiss here. you missed the point. living a "good life" has no eternal consequences. once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end. to you, it is over. to you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. but then you contradict yourself. from a previous post, you said doing evil things is bad. to you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things. it is all meaningless in the end anyway. so go rob a bank. go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag. what's restraining you? life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant. > in the same way, i think life is fun. and i don't intend to leave the > amusement park of life until they close down for the night! :-d at which time, you are truly not the master of yourself. >>i'm sorry, i don't feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god >>i'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in >>which case it's not really all that important. > >has the resurrection sunk in? jesus is alive. jesus is not dead. so you (and your holy book) say. by the same token, therefore, santa claus delivers toys every xmas. don't you see? i have no reason to believe that what you say is true. please give me some reason that i can't similarly apply to santa claus. you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses of jesus say are true. but you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" the reasons. by definition, "ignorance". santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer. ever see a flying reindeer? has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer? has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red? on the other hand, are people born in bethlehem? was nebuchandezzar really a king? was daniel really one of his court officials? were david and solomon really kings of israel and judah? was their really a king called jehoachin? did sennecherib really attack jerusalem 600 years before christ? did sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly? was there really a caiaphas who interrogated jesus? yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies it. it is nonfiction. do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction? perhaps you can't evaluate the context of grimm's fairy tales apart from that of the scientific american. i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity. is this what you are telling me? or is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that it's not a fairy tale? >are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a >collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without >invoking them? get real. have you ever been to zaire? do you have to go there to be assured that there really is such a place? given your irrationality, i take it you have never used a map in your life. > why do you believe what you believe? given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living god, i'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i didn't follow jesus.
the law of retribution violent crime, racism, bigotry, domestic abuse, rape, police brutality and oppression, human rights violations, etc., etc., continue to get worse and worse in spite of more and more man-made laws on all levels from local ordinances to international law. the man-made laws are not working. "what we have here is failure to communicate!" perpetrators remain ignorant of the law--a universal, cosmic, and spiritual law--the "law of retribution" or "karma": "be not deceived; god is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." galatians 6:7, kjv. "he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. here is the patience and faith of the saints." revelation 13:10, kjv. "what goes around comes around." this law of the universe is just as real as the physical law that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. it is the enforcement, the teeth, behind the "golden rule": "do unto others as you would have others do unto you." all perpetrators in the present will become victims in the future, most likely in a future incarnation. most victims in the present were perpetrators in the past, usually during a previous life. what is needed is a massive worldwide program of education to teach all present and potential perpetrators, in a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), that what they do to others will be done to them, in this life or the next. anyone who doubts the fact of reincarnation, and the related "law of retribution", should read books such as "here and hereafter", by ruth montgomery, which describes several kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation, including hypnotic regression to past lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], spontaneous recall (especially by young children, some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), dream recall of past life experiences, deja vu (familiarity with a far off land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), the psychic readings of the late edgar cayce, and even supporting statements from the christian bible including matthew 17:11-13 (john the baptist was the reincarnation of elias.) and john 9:1-2 (how can a person possibly sin before he is born, unless he lived before?!). strong interests, innate talents, strong phobias, etc., typically originate from a person's past lives. for example, a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having drowned at the end of a previous life. and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to another person being met for the first time in their present life, because of a bad encounter with him during a previous incarnation. people would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future, or in a future incarnation! for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (books like "here and hereafter", by ruth montgomery). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important information is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine 2nd initiate in eckankar, (but not an agent thereof)

: in my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a : reach. science has its basis in observable fact. i'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. the myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense. bill : if one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. considering : the meaning of the word "objective" i doubt that this will ever happen. : so, back to the original question: : and objective morality is.....? this may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. the first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. the concept supposedly described may have meaning however. if there is a god as described by the christians (for instance), then he has existence apart from and independent of humankind; his existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). if this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since he has defined himself as omnipotent and, if his claims are to be believed, he is at least omnipotent relative to us. god is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever he says it is - in an objective sense. if god determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. if human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. the standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. this may be due as bill much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it or not, it's there.x

are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? what about homosexual writers who agree with the official history? don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexuals? i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism. no one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. >i challenge anyone to document this claim. if you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just irving), then the burden of proof is on you. track down the references. find out where the stories originate from. again, you are the one in germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not. >i *have* found a great >deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the >nazis. this seems to include all of the worst ones--hitler, himmler, >goebbels, goering, heydrich, eichmann, and many more. eh? what is your agenda here? to prove that the nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? does it bother you that some of the nazis might have been homosexuals? does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? of course not. and what about bisexuals? are they half-nazis? i don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazis were homosexuals. the german officer corps before ww1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. there were numerous scandals which rocked the german govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. many of the kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the kaiser was no homosexual, but the germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into prussian history - back to frederick the great at least, who was himself a homosexual. roehm was a product of this prussian officer tradition, and the old german army (like the english public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook roehm's homosexuality. in addition, some nazis complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth. the hitler youth swallowed up all pre-nazi youth groups, and some of the various pre-war vandervogel, bund, and volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. so it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazis, regardless of the official nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality. why should this suprise anyone? homosexuality has always existed, in all societies - it would be most unusual if the nazis were an exception. no, i don't have any sources for you, as i think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and i do not have access to these. nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazis and on modern homosexuality that i have ever read - i don't have the time. nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. until you prove otherwise, though, i will stick with the established histories. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ david matthew deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu) "...be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...let the gods speak softly of us in days hereafter..."

brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter, or we must discount every other book of antiquity: >>(1) peter died two millenia ago. the original letters he wrote have >>long since decayed into dust. if he were alive today and i could > > do you question the existence of alexander the great, tilgrath pilisar iii, > nero, caligula, josephus, cyrus the great, artexerxes? their documents > have decayed to dust too. brian, why another excuse? mr ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every "historical" document. somehow i doubt do that yourself that. thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document, i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter. i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which i am sure you reject; it dates from the time of ramses ii (this was first presented here by matthew wiener). these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were carved with the pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather than mere copies. this account records the the battle of kadesh (circa 1285 bc), which occurred on the river orontes, (about 100 miles south of aleppo). the egyptians won this battle with the hittites, and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place. a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form. it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeated the hittites, after being separated from his troops. note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. the following is from miriam lichtheim`s _ancient egyptian literature_ volume ii. 	my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall 	on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into 	the water of the orontes. i was after them like a griffin; 	i attacked all the countries, i alone. for my infantry and 	my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking 	back. as i live, as ra loves me, as my father atum favors 	me, everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth, 	in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry. (note: this paragraph records not only ramses "divine word," but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event. now from the heart of battle.) 	then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces 	of the foe from hitti, being alone by himself, none other 	with him. his majesty proceeded to look about him and 	found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ... 	no officer was with me, no charioteer, 	no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; 	my infantry, my chariotry yielded before them, 	not one of them stood firm to fight with them. 	his majesty spoke: "what is this, father amun? 	is it right for a father to ignore his son? 	are my deeds a matter for you to ignore? 	do i not walk and stand at your word? 	i have not neglected an order you gave. 	too great is he, the great lord of egypt, 	to allow aliens to step on his path! 	what are these asiatics to you, o amun, 	the wretches ignorant of god? 	have i not made for you many great monuments, 	... 	i call to you, my father amun, 	i am among a host of strangers; 	all countries are arrayed against me, 	i am alone, there's none with me! 	... 	the labors of many people are nothing, 	amun is more helpful than they; 	i came here by the command of your mouth, 	o amun, i have not transgressed your command!" 	now though i prayed in a distant land, 	my voice resounded in southern thebes. 	i found amun came when i called to him, 	he gave me his hand and i rejoiced. 	he called from behind as if near by: 	"forward, i am with you, 	i your father, my hand is with you, 	i prevail over a hundred thousand men, 	i am lord of victory, lover of valor!" 	i found my heart stout, my breast in joy, 	all i did succeeded, i was like mont. 	... 	i slaughtered among them at my will, 	not one looked behind him, 	not one turned around, 	whoever fell down did not rise. 	... 	one called out to the other saying: 	"no man is he who is among us, 	it is seth great-of-strength, baal in person; 	not deeds of man are these his doings, 	they are of one who is unique, 	who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots, 	come quick, flee before him, 	to seek life and breathe air; 	for he who attempts to get close to him, 	his hands, all his limbs grow limp. 	one cannot hold either bow or spears, 	when one sees him come racing along!" 	my majesty hunted them like a griffin, 	i slaughtered among them unceasingly. so you see brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittites. do you reject them as being *completely* true? i suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words: "question the existence of alexander the great, tilgrath pilisar iii, nero, caligula, josephus, cyrus the great, artexerxes?" do you also thereby question all their documents? that`s the problem with your "all or nothing" approach. many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts. so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter (and the rest of the new testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all, forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible. as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus, that he must be true: > are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? > are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from > shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer > programmers, fiction? with a scoff of your keyboard, with near > complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that > that is all complete hooey? would that not be the most audacious > display of arrogance? do you actually think you know better than > king solomon, king david, or even abraham lincoln? i have three points. first, this is "argumentum ad populum" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth. for instance, do the millions of hindu's past and present who testify to the reality of brahma, constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma? how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus: 	"with a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of 	 the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete 	 hooey?" if you do so "scoff," then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading? second, it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus. you can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. third, it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian, and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity. in fact there was much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a deist. oh my). i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i've previously done for tyre, jefferson and etc. 				later, 				dave butler "my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for thinking i shall ever change them." 					abraham lincoln 					to judge j s wakefield 					after the death of willie lincoln.

the following partial summary of a theory of the universe includes a little-known description of the creation of our solar system: larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a "unified field theory" in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations. but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years! the late physicist dewey b. larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, which he calls the "reciprocal system", is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time: (1) "the physical universe is composed entirely of one component, motion, existing in three dimensions, in discrete units, and in two reciprocal forms, space and time." (2) "the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics, its magnitudes are absolute, and its geometry is euclidean." from these two postulates, larson developed a complete theoretical universe, using various combinations of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotational motions, the concepts of in-ward and out-ward scalar motions, and speeds in relation to the speed of light (which larson called "unit velocity" and "the natural datum"). at each step in the development, larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles [incomplete atoms], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, etc.), even objects not yet discovered then (such as exploding galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts). and applying his theory to his new model of the atom, larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of matter. all of this is described in good detail, with-out fancy complex mathematics, in his books. books of dewey b. larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b. larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe. some of the early books are out of print now, but still available through inter-library loan. "the structure of the physical universe" (1959) "the case against the nuclear atom" (1963) "beyond newton" (1964) "new light on space and time" (1965) "quasars and pulsars" (1971) "nothing but motion" (1979) [a $9.50 substitute for the $8.3 billion "super collider".] [the last four chapters explain chemical bonding.] "the neglected facts of science" (1982) "the universe of motion" (1984) [final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries.] "basic properties of matter" (1988) all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers, p.o. box 13255, portland, or 97213, and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library doesn't have each of them. several of them, including the last one, are available from: the international society of unified science (isus), 1680 e. atkin ave., salt lake city, utah 84106. this is the organization that was started to promote larson's theory. they have other related publications, including the quarterly journal "reciprocity". physicist dewey b. larson's background physicist dewey b. larson was a retired engineer (chemical or electrical). he was about 91 years old when he died in may 1989. he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university. he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used. larson's lack of a fancy "ph.d." degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is not a valid reason. sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees. at the same time, it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their contradictions, ad hoc assumptions, principles of impotence, in-consistencies, etc.. larson did not have the funds, etc. to experimentally test his theory. and it was not necessary for him to do so. he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers' experimental and observational data. and in many cases, his explanation fit better. a self-consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have! they claim to be looking for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been ignoring one for over 30 years now! "modern physics" does not explain the physical universe so well. some parts of some of larson's books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree. and remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., also once seemed to explain it well, but were later proved conceptually wrong. prof. frank h. meyer, professor emeritus of uw-superior, was/is a strong proponent of larson's theory, and was (or still is) president of larson's organization, "the international society of unified science", and editor of their quarterly journal "reciprocity". he moved to minneapolis after retiring. "super collider" boondoggle! i am against contruction of the "superconducting super collider", in texas or anywhere else. it would be a gross waste of money, and contribute almost nothing of "scientific" value. most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b. larson, as described in his books, the strange goofy particles ("mesons", "hyperons", alleged "quarks", etc.) which they are finding in existing colliders (fermi lab, cern, etc.) are really just atoms of anti-matter, which are created by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment. a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not seen there before, and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now! are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 billion cost?!! don't we have much more important uses for this wasted money?! another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground cables. how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the "supercollider"?! naming the "super collider" after ronald reagon, as proposed, is totally absurd! if it is built, it should be named after a leading particle physicist. larsonian anti-matter in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, anti-matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles. it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made, in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, which larson calls "unit velocity" and the "natural datum". in larson's theory, a positron is actually a particle of matter, not anti-matter. when a positron and electron meet, the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each other. in larson's theory, the anti-matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time, and only one dimension of space, and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half. larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century. 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets (venus, earth, jupiter, etc.). the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help "prove" einstein's "general theory of relativity". but the late physicist dewey b. larson achieved results closer to the 43 seconds than "general relativity" can, by instead using "special relativity". in one or more of his books, he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury. larson totally rejected "general relativity" as another mathematical fantasy. he also rejected most of "special relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near the speed of light, and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts, (those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 really are moving faster than the speed of light, although most of that motion is away from us in time.). in larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, there are three dimensions of time instead of only one. but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe. the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time. at low relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are negligible; but at high speeds, they become significant, and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor. [larson often used the term "coordinate time" when writing about this.] in regard to "mass increases", it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light. but the formula for acceleration is acceleration = force / mass, (a = f/m). orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor: force. in larson's theory, mass stays constant and force drops toward zero. force is actually a motion, or combinations of motions, or relations between motions, including inward and outward scalar motions. the expansion of the universe, for example, is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so-called "big bang" (which is yet another mathematical fantasy). the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book "the universe of motion", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacific publishers, (p.o. box 13255, portland, oregon 97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover. it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author, an unrecognized genius, more than thirty years ago. it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries, including the formation of galaxies, binary and multiple star systems, and solar systems, the true origin of the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the true nature of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds! the following is an example of his theory's success: in his first book in 1959, "the structure of the physical universe", larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies, several years before astronomers started finding them. they are a necessary consequence of larson's comprehensive theory. and when quasars were discovered, he had an immediate related explanation for them also. gamma-ray bursts astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma-ray bursts. they were originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the disc of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly, and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence). gamma-ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson. according to page 386 of his book "the universe of motion", published in 1984, the gamma-ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti-matter half of the physical universe, which larson calls the "cosmic sector". because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at random. (this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects, and come from all directions uniformly.) i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on earth! there would be no way to predict one, nor to stop it! perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past, which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were actually caused by nearby gamma-ray bursts! larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double. but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson. i will try to summarize larsons explanation, which is detailed in chapter 7 of his book "the universe of motion" and in some of his other books. first of all, according to larson, stars do not generate energy by "fusion". a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse. the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements (heavier than iron). each element has a destructive temperature limit. the heavier the element is, the lower is this limit. a star's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements. when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron, there is a type i supernova explosion! this is because there is so much iron present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process, which larson explains in some of his books [better than i can]. when the star explodes, the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light. the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light, because of the high temperature. the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light, and it expands outward in time, which is equivalent to inward in space, and it often actually disappears for a while. over long periods of time, both masses start to fall back gravitationally. the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star. the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star. both stars then start moving back toward the "main sequence" from opposite directions on the h-r diagram. the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space, making a single lone star again, are near zero. they will instead form a binary system, orbiting each other. according to larson, a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient (is densest at its surface), because the material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown outward) in time. this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about "degenerate matter", "neutron stars", "black holes", etc.. larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small, then, instead of a single white dwarf star, there will be several "mini" white dwarf stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably still too far away in three-dimensional time to be affected by its heat, etc.). these will become planets! in chapter 7 of the universe of motion, larson used all this information, and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, to derive his own version of bode's law. "black hole" fantasy! i heard that physicist stephen w. hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two "black holes" merging together into a single "black hole", and concluded that the new "black hole" would have more mass than the sum of the two original "black holes". such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag, causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of "black holes", etc.! after reading physicist dewey b. larson's books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe, especially his book "the universe of motion", it is clear to me that "black holes" are nothing more than mathematical fantasies! the strange object at cygnus x-1 is just an unusually massive white dwarf star, not the "black hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to "prove" their theory. by the way, i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking. the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking's severe physical problem somehow makes him "wiser". it does not! i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b. larson while he was still alive. widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson's theory, books, and organization (the international society of unified science). electro-magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago, in connection with ufo's and unorthodox inventors, but i never was able to find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112-113 of the book "basic properties of matter", by the late physicist dewey b. larson, which describes part of larson's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe. i quote one paragraph: "as indicated in the preceding chapter, the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance. the electrons, we find, are derived from the environment. it was brought out in volume i [larson's book "nothing but motion"] that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited. it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged. in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, and the relation of space to space is not motion. in open space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system, in the manner of a photon. in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system. all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation. meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, whereby electrons are returned to the environment. the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." note that in larson's theory, uncharged electrons are also massless, and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate). ("unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, according to larson's theory.) [i might have the "above" and "below" labels mixed up.] larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass- less un-charged electrons flying around at the speed of light! if this is true, then the electro-magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps giving them a charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion. (in larson's theory, an electrical charge is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the rotation of the particle.) the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds. suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson has been available for more than 30 years, published in 1959 in his first book "the structure of the physical universe". it is totally un-scientific for hawking, wheeler, sagan, and the other sacred priests of the religion they call "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to totally ignore larson's theory has they have. larson's theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. larson's theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, in the u.s. and elsewhere. and at least the basic principles of larson's theory should be included in all related courses at uw-ec, uw-madison, cambridge, cornell university, and elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed. for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (especially larson's books). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important partial summary is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine b.s., physics and astronomy, uw-ec

>i'm curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique >on the religion, classical text such as "age of reason" by paine, >or "the myth maker" by jacobi. sometimes it is good to know your >enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand >both sides, and not solely the one and only right one. yes, one does. i examined a critique of the book of romans by i think, benjamin franklin once, a deist. i found it amazing that benjamin franklin missed the whole boat. i also have the writings on thomas jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how much he missed. i have studied plato's theory of forms and aristotelian hylomorphesism. what a pile of junk. jesus makes plato and aristotle look like kindergardeners. psychology, the id, ego, superego by freud? elements of truth, but jesus explained it far better and gave reasons. thomas paine, benjamin franklin, thomas jefferson are mere men. they can screw up the bible just as well as any man. i do not put these men on a pedestal. and if i remember t.j.'s autobiography correctly, he thought thomas paine was the most unread man he ever met. here's some more circular reasoning to you. paul says to the corinthians that "that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is spiritually discerned." and so, people without the spirit of god haven't a clue to what the bible is saying. from your point of view, that's incredibly circular and convenient. to me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre. i can see it, but you can't. this is not arrogance on my part. trust me. it is as bizarre to you as it is to me. but nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not. are any of you color blind to red and green? i am. remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's? they put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots? if your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots. they are a slightly different color and stand out from the background. but if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots. that is how a dot test appears to me. i do not see a pattern at all. a normal seeing person will see the patterns. and to him, i seem like a total anomaly. to him, i appear as if i am missing the universe or something. it is hard for him to understand why i can't see anything that to him is as plain as day. that it what it is like with the bible, the word of god, to the believer. the believer can see the meaning in the words. i can see how the patterns fit together. there is such depth. such consistency. but then, on the other hand, i notice the non-believer. he doesn't see it. he thinks i am weird because he thinks i am seeing things. i look at him, and say, "no, you are weird. you do not see." then it is time for a sanity check. i go to another christian and say, "do you see this." and they go, "yes. it is an "x"". and i say, "thank god, i see the "x" too." it is truly the strangest thing. it adds a little extra dimension to the phrase, "he will make the blind see, and the deaf hear." i am glad that jesus has enabled me to see. i wish every non-believer could see what they are missing.

i am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _the easy-to-read book of mormon_ (former title: _mormon's book_) by lynn matthews anderson is now available through anonymous ftp (see information below). in addition to the change in title, the revised etr bom has been shortened by several pages (eliminating many extraneous "that's" and "of's"), and many (minor) errors have been corrected. this release includes a simplified joseph smith story, testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a "words-to-know" glossary. as with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a not-for-profit endeavor. this is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. people can recuperate the actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book. see the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms. negotiations are currently underway with a mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books. (sorry, i'm out of the wire-bound "first editions.") i will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out. ftp information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then "cd pub" (you won't see anything at all until you do). "the easy-to-read book of mormon" is currently available in postscript and rtf (rich text format). (ascii, latex, and other versions can be made available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) you should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an apple laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (the postscript in the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work better.) rtf is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors, including microsoft word for both the macintosh and windows. if you don't have a postscript printer, you may be able to use the rtf file to print out a copy of the book. -r--r--r-- 1 dba 1984742 apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps -r--r--r-- 1 dba 1209071 apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf for more information about how this project came about, please refer to my article in the current issue of _sunstone_, entitled "delighting in plainness: issues surrounding a simple modern english book of mormon." send all inquiries and comments to: lynn matthews anderson 5806 hampton street pittsburgh, pa 15206 dba+lynn@cs.cmu.edu

in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words translated into the word "hell". these greek words have totally different meanings. the words are hades, tartaros, and gehenna. in bibical usage, the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the new testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol... meaning the grave or pit (compare acts 2:27 with psalms 16:10). hades may be likened to a hole in the ground. (in the bible it has nothing to do with fire!) most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice. why? because when seeing the word "hell" many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never remotely intended in the greek language or in old english! in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of "shadowy realm." hades is simply the abode we call the grave. all dead go to this hell. the second "hell" of the bible, tartaros, is mentioned only once in scripture, 2 pet.2:4; "for if god spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell (tartaros), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment..." following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne (isa.14:12-14; rev.12:4), the archangel lucifer (now satan) and a third of the created angels (now demons) were ejected from heaven (luke 10:18). they were cast down to tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (jude 6; 1 cor.6:3). tartaros, then, is a "hell" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans). nowhere in the bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular "hell". the the third word that is translated as "hell" in the bible is gehenna. it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom, meaning "valley of hinniom." hinnom is a deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem. in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including infant sacrifice (it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made their children "pass through the fire" to the god molech. the rites were specifically celebrated in tophet, the "place of abhorrence," one of the chief groves in the valley). king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations. he defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 kings 23:10). later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem; a repository for sewage, refuse and animal carcasses. the bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish. fires burned continuously, feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse. aceldama, the "field of blood", purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ (matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of hinnom. so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell? in rev.19:20: the satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure, the false prophet, working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming. their fate is revealed by the apostle john: "and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet... these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." where will this temporary lake of fire (this "hell") be? the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast: "for tophet (in the valley of hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (isa.30:33). one thousand years later, satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast! (rev.20:10). but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia? does the bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire? in the sequence of rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there! (rev.20:15). what will become of these wicked? will they writhe in flames for eternity? the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna fire on the earth. they wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed! this punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final). the bible calls it the "second death" (rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection. the bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing. the prophet malachi provides a graphic description. "for, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..." (4:1). to the righteous, god says that the wicked shall be "ashes under the soles of your feet..."(mal.4:3). gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living torture! jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or valley of hinnom. utter destruction by fire was complete. nothing was left, but ashes! every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)! the bible says, in romans 6:23, "the wages of sin is death", not eternal life in torture. the punishment revealed in the bible is death... the cessation of life. eternal life is the gift of god!

(obviously, only in > fencing practice with friends...) well, let me see if i can explain it. it's similar to collecting coins, or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about everything is collected). in all cases, you might consider it something of an aberration; i mean, what purpose does it serve? not much really; it's just a hobby. the collector yearns for diversity (not much use in having two of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first one to do it this way), rarity, and so on. some people use their collections, other people do not. as you state, you use your collection. in one sense, this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure. in another sense, it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection. some people collect firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect. it's just personal preference. oops, 'personal preference' ... i guess we're not supposed to have that any more, are we? j.baker.
