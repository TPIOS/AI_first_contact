people are going >to see gretzky. they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't >got a winner. they've had much better teams in their past history than >they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then. i don't think this is accurate. the *tickets* sell, but people don't go to the games. i think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in la don't always use their tickets. so in effect, after the kings initial success following gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much. whether or not the kings are a 'winner' is debatable. i claim that since gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...i also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynasty...but that's another story and included only because i don't like mcnall:-). anyway, mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky, and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc. but as i said, when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold. >i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky, the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power. for the short term, imo. although i think that it's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky, simply because they make people around them better. >but winning sure as hell helps. ;-) well, at least we are in full agreement here! >this does not make roger's point any more valid, but the jets aren't so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...> >getting a huge jump in productivity, yet they are getting a huge >jump in attendance. this is due to the emergence of teemu selanne. >they have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because >they are winning. yes, but they are doing no worse than last year. i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games. it's difficult to predict, but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels? i seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without selanne. i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the cfl...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the cfl? if that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then i'm curious to hear your explanation.

i can only comment on the kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik. he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). in fact, he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey. kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. but, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. a better choice would be tomas sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. other than that, the award goes to robert lang, an uninspiring czech. robitaille could easily be mvp, but i'd prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than hartford. honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel. jon

well, i gotta tell ya, last night's leafs game vs the devils was a nail-bitter let me tell you! it was a well played game by both teams (i thought) but according to the don and ron it was the an "off-night" for the leafs and the devils were outplaying toronto. well, i beg to differ.... imho, clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did. his fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the clark of old. (but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour). i think the leafs are playing great hockey. why? well first look at their injury list which includes, cullen, ellet, zezel, macoun. of course my question is this....how will the leafs fare when they are once again "healthy" if they are playing this well so far?? second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (btw, am i wrong or was this potvin's first shut-out? i can't remember him having any as of yet.) well, as of april 3 we see that the race for first in the norris has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto. and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?) coming to the stretch and still a roar'in!!!!! go leafs go!!!! -- ****************************************** * alfred (yong-jeh) yim * toronto wins the * 4b mathematics (actuarial science) * ( ? ) cup. * university of waterloo, canada. * i like "coca-cola" idea personally * e-mail: ayim@descartes.waterloo.edu * *****************************************************************************

hi. according to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver dollar being minted in canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the stanley cup. now, i know full well what coins are used every day in canada. i can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact. my question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that i know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what? is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated? if it is an uncirculated coin, what's the current cost and what's its potential value? just curious. if no one knows, i'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is). thanks again -- valerie hammerl			"some days i have to remind him he's not hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu	mario lemieux." herb brooks on claude acscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edu	lemieux, top scorer for the devils, but v085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu known for taking dumb penalties.

tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including vin damphousse and brian bellows to phillidelphia, phillie will send eric lindros to ottawa, and ottawa will give it's first round pick to montreal. if this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa gets to choose 1st overall. can ottawa afford lindros' salary? personally, i can't see philli giving up lindros -- for anything. they didn't give away that much to quebec just to trade him away again. not to mention that lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the franchise. ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from montreal for the pick. stephen legge slegge@kean.ucs.munc.ca

ten years ago, the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter of what it is now. going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of euros on nhl teams have escalated to the following stats: canadians: 400 americans: 100 europeans: 100 please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun. here's the point: there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let's say, the red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like "bure" "konstantinov" and "borshevshky". is this north america or isn't it? toronto, detriot, quebec, and edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well. i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about "pavel bure, the russian rocket" i will completely throw up. as it is now, every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross-check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way, i'm not a canucks fan to begin with ;-). okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. it's all hype. this "european mystique" is sickening, but until nhl owners get over it, canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league. with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse. i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league, and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent. i just don't want them on mine. -- richard j. rauser "you have no idea what you're doing." rauser@sfu.ca "oh, don't worry about that. we're professional wni outlaws - we do this for a living." ----------------- "remember, no matter where you go, there you are." -dr.banzai

i haven't seen anyone post this so i will do the honors. maine beat lssu 5-4 in milwaukee on saturday night. it was quite a game. maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it. maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. lssu came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1. lssu came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. the play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. lssu scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. now it looked like lssu might just walk away with the game. coach walsh, of maine, replaced the starting goalie dunham with snow, who won the game against michigan. snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. the third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind. maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. they were all scored by jim montgomery, the tournament mvp, and all assisted by paul kariya. the last minute of the game bears highlighting. the change to snow also proved the difference in the end. with one minute to go and with the lssu goalie pulled, snow dueled with a lssu forward in a amazing set of moves by both. snow won. it was a great way to end the game. this year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one month. the bradley center holds approximately 17,700. -- +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ douglas j. peterson have _--____ ____ peterson@pms860.pms.ford.com you ` / ---- / safety laboratories department driven -/- __ ____ _ / ford motor company a . / / \--/___/ \/ (313) 390-8089 \_/ ,\_/ / \_/_ lately?

the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night, and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout. tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack. injuries: pelle eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh. roster moves: jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game. jason was the flyers second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4", 210 lbs. in 62 games with the tri-city americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 pim. he plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well. andre faust was returned to hershey. he actually left after the second period of the kings game, flew to albany, got the game tying goal in a bears ot win, and played again for hershey sunday night. lines: fedyk-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy acton-brown galley-mcgill yushkevich-cronin carkner-hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal. acton replaced lomakin in the 3rd period. game summary: if the flyers played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. the flyers hit everything that moved. they created scoring chance after scoring chance. they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do. jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal. he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found brind'amour crashing the net on the other side. a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa's body should have been a goal, but puppa made a great save reading the play. garry galley gave the maple leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at 4:25. the flyers lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound. after the power play, the flyers got a goal on an ugly play. rod brind'amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a 1-0 flyers lead at 8:10. the flyers kept the pressure on, and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while. eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. bowen started giving some lindros-like checks in his own corners. then lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. he had foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards, and mike "mister" mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 the leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill. with time running out in the period, recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf's blue line. they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun, lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi, but then clark checked recchi off the puck. macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point. he drove it from just inside the blue line. macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. shots were 13-8 flyers in the period. the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone. during the power play, the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down, but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head. we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. as time was running out in the advantage, lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save. the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up, passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle, and eric one-timed past puppa at 7:55. with the assist, recchi moves past bobby clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a flyer at 117. eric moves up to 4th all time in flyers rookie scoring with 67 points. mike eastwood took down al conroy at 8:30 to give the flyers another chance on the power play. not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the leafs had most of the possession. the flyers smothered the leafs short power play. tempers flared a little at 13:14. bowen and pearson got roughing minors, keith acton got a bloody face. dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. the replay showed that hawgood's stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell. again the flyers smothered the leafs power play, led by dimitri yushkevich. bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson. berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. he had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to gilmour at the side of the net, but soderstrom stoned him. the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. shots were 13-10 flyers. the flyers were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little. the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past puppa. then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for doug gilmour and lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for glenn anderson and mcgill (roughing) all at 7:02. terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on gilmour. again the flyers smothered the leafs power play. at about the 12 minute mark, dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom. the puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). seconds later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12:24 to give the leafs another chance on the power play. on the advantage, after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down, andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. they kept the pressure on, but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout. recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. no punches thrown, recchi got the initial minor, krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors. at 17:02 rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck, and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill's face. the flyers were not happy with that at all. 5-8 al conroy paired up with 6-1 berehowski, and started throwing punches. upward. well, al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and al got a standing o! penalties: eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, clark, carkner 10 each. berehowski and conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49. so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers. the had no interest in stting on the lead. hawgood, galley and brind'amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at 18:39. that was all the fireworks, tommy soderstrom would not face another shot. puppa did, but kept the flyers off the board. 4-0 flyers, shots were 9-8 flyers in the 3rd. probably the strongest game i've seen from the flyers since the all star break. shutout number 4 for soderstrom, all since 1/10. tied for 2nd most in the nhl, but he's played fewer games than belfour (6) or the goalie i can't remember that he's tied with. next up it's the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg. the flyers cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end. flyers up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80). tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. the tragic number for 5th is 5 points, i watched the rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before i finished this up. why 5 points instead of 4? well, the flyers will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie. the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils, the pens twice, the flyers, and finish up with 2 games against the caps. so i guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on. flyers team record watch: eric lindros: 38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points (rookie records) club record goals:			club record points: eric lindros	38 1992-93		dave

well, here it is, nhl in the year 2000. i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun... you can see the league has already started to move to this direction. *the walt disney conference* anaheim mighty chipmunks -franchise name to be changed after each new la kings hockey movie la flames -we've seen some of that san jose sharks san diego bruins tijuana red wings -detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry... dallas stars houston oilers texas rangers seattle canucks *the norm green conference* alabama white hawks biloxi blues tampa bay lightning miami blades helsinki jets -you've heard them starting getting used to the anthem montreal quebecois (sp?) -there will be no 'canada' atlanta devils orlando penquins key west islanders hartford whalers the whalers will never move, huh? palm beach capitals now that the anahaim team is becomming real i'm really beginning to believe the rest of the 'message'. i'm sure the future will turn you into believers too. after 2000 the nhl will abandond ice-rinks. it's so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway. nhl will become a roller skating hockey league. that way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards ! i hope i'm just out of my mind. there won't really be a disney team in anaheim, will there? the stars aren't really moving...

mighty ones get mightier: tps, the finnish champions 1992/3, are getting still stronger! i just heard some news, according to which tps has acquired the next finnish hockey superstar(??) jere lehtinen from kiekko-espoo! there are also some rumours about erik kakko (reipas) and marko jantunen (kalpa) being traded to tps. both of this players are currently on the finnish olympic team. i think that jantunen is drafted to the nhl, too. btw. is juha yl|nen (centre, hpk) drafted by the jets?? during last year he has reached the top level among finnish centres. he had very good playoff games against tps! hannu >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>> go jets go ! >>>>>>>> teemu ! >>>>>>> teppo ! >>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>> tappara >>>>>> canadiens >>>>>>> blackhawks >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

i was playing this golf game and something interesting happened. on the 7th hole, i drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was in mid-flight, the game completely froze. a couple seconds later, the screen went completely black, with an error message in large "bubble" letters that said division by zero. i thought it was funny considering i am a computer programmer, and i had never seen an error like this on an actual video game system like sega or nintendo (or even atari or intellevision years ago). oh yeah, after the message, there was also what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. i forget the exact hex code that was given. has this happened to anyone else??? it must have, my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this. thanks randy psc r_turgeo@oz.plymouth.edu
on the lindros "trade": like ottawa would be stupid enough to get lindros. why do you think quebec traded him? lindros would go on personal strike again...maybe i should talk to ottawa mgmt. about arranging such a trade.... ;-) on that xenophobe: thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly. maybe we should look at baseball, the supposed "american" pasttime (sp?). look at all the damn latin americans playing there! they should all be deported! they aren't american! (add sarcasm to taste) to roger: wow, for once we agree. i hope this isn't a sign of things to come.... i'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the leafs being the best in the campbell. ;-) on the rangers: i told someone that nothing that happened in the patrick would surprise me anymore. i lied. how the hell can a team go into washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful hartford? the absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity. i can't stand it. from what i've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as beezer played pretty poorly. smith is talking about calling up corey hirsch from binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the same team which wanted to prove itself in washington. *now* nothing that happens in the patrick will surprise me.

i think that nhlpa' 93 is the best video game available now. of course many things could be done better, but i really appreciate that the names of players are the real ones, no matter if it lacks some logos... i am still playing it since november leading different teams to the finals and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring: yesterday i won the title using toronto against hartford (4 games to two), i played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and the best scorer and shooter was gilmour (116 shots if i remember well) -- _____________________________________________________ iskander ayari email : iskander.ayari@loria.fr ou ayari@loria.fr _____________________________________________________

for those leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for return on thursday's winnipeg-toronto game : peter zezel, john cullen mark osborne and dave ellett are questionable to return on thursday. all regular players who were injured (including dimitri mironov) should be back for saturday's home game against the flyers.

(oh yeah, and how many europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in north america? while there are some that play in the ahl, or the ihl where that's an nhl team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many europeans playing in the chl, the echl, or on the secondary farm teams in the ihl. (ie. the jets do have a few russian players in moncton, but i don't believe there are any europeans in ft. wayne.)) so with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in north america. > > with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating, the problem is clearly >only getting worse. > > i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league, and let the bures >and selannes of the world play on their own continent. > > i just don't want them on mine. i'm in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the world. i've grown up with europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world. from hedberg, nilsson, and sjoberg, to sel{nne, zhamnov, and olausson, and all those in between and to come, i wouldn't have it any other way. daryl turner : r.s.h contact for the winnipeg jets internet: umturne4@ccu.umanitoba.ca fidonet: 1:348/701 -or- 1:348/4 (please route through 348/700) tkachuk over to zhamnov, up to sel{nne, he shoots, he scores! the jets win the cup! the jets win the cup! essensa for vezina! housley for norris! sel{nne for calder!

(i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player) when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved. remember these: - lindros did not want to play in quebec (for more than $ reasons) - nicholls ... in edmonton. - r. courtnall wanted to be traded to la only. - c. lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year. i know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more: - some american players who played for the expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities. one players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal. anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved to london, spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?) i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe. myself i would like to see some european teams, but what would be the best way to do it? marc
ee0i+@andrew.cmu.edu ("ethan z. evans") writes: : : of course, penalties will have to be changed: : : roughing:	chauvanistic males being aggressive : slashing:	chauvanistic males venting frustration : fighting:	proof that males cannot cope with their feelings : no no no! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should only be three penalties: 1. foul (any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick). if you get 5 you are out for the game. 2. unsportsmanlike contact. (an intentional foul). this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. if you get two you are thrown out of the game, and fined. 3. technical foul. bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. penalty shot is awarded. two and you are thrown out of the game. besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured. this works well for several reasons. first, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? so, it follows that the more the better. next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (don meredith, dick vitale, john madden, pat summerall, and marv levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it. oh, one other rule. when a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it. this way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. then, once the pa announcer has told them who scored, the tv announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right. seriously, though, i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. i was amazed how boring it was. the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests during the period!. of course the 'laker girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. there is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. the game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours. the reason for this has to be tv. there is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. on tv, basketball is fairly entertaining, imho. but, it is better to watch it on tv than to be there. if this is the road the nhl is following, then it truly is a sad day. enough for now. dvb

questions: q: why are the montreal canadiens called the habs? a: most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in and around montreal. hence they were called "les habitants" (natives of montreal). this was then shortened to the habs. q: why is the montreal canadiens logo a large c with an h within it? a: in 1914-15, the canadiens logo consisted of c with an a within it to signify club athletique canadien (cac). the next year, cac no longer existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify club de hockey. q: what is the most informative hockey publication? a: the hockey news is preferred by most north american hockey fans. it is a weekly journal with up-to-date info. phone: 800-268-7793 (canada and us) phone/fax: 0483 776141 (uk and rest of europe) q: how does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in the nhl? a: if x goals are scored, then the team gets credit for x goals in x+1 chances. q: how is +/- computed in the nhl? a: first, +/- only applies to skaters. except for a power-play goal, when a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. short- handed goals do count for +/-. q: what is the five-hole? a: the space between a goalie's pads. there are five major scoring zones: (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower right, and (5) five-hole. q: what is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice? a: this tradition began in detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven series were required to win the stanley cup. every time detroit won a game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice. q: who was the first woman to play in an nhl game? a: manon rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever to play in an nhl game on september 23, 1992 when she started in net for the expansion tampa bay lightning in an exhibition against the st. louis blues. rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat expo hall on the florida state fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine shots. she left with the score tied 2-2, although the lightning ultimately lost the game, 6-4. q: what is the richest contract in nhl history? a: mario lemieux, the superstar center of the pittsburgh penguins, signed the richest contract in nhl history, a seven-year deal believed to be worth about $42 million. lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league. q: who is the new commissioner of the nhl? a: gary bettman, vice president and general counsel of the national basketball association, was named commissioner of the national hockey league, friday, december 11, 1992. bettman joined the nba in 1981 as assistant general counsel. he became the league's chief legal officer in september of 1984. a new york resident, bettman graduated from cornell university in 1974 and from new york university school of law in 1977. q: how many professional hockey leagues are there in north america? a: six: national, american, international, east coast, central and colonial hockey leagues.

after watching the pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), i've really noticed an increase in tom barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). i've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. just as examples last night, i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens (scott) and tocchet 2 minute minors. he also kicked john mclean. of course he wasn't called for that. isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest. there's no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall. he's also very good. how about that tocchet head-butt? is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? i can't remember anymore. oh, the playoffs should be fun, ralph

(that way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!) ralph

	well, the patrick division got a little more interesting last night. the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens. that means if the isles beat the devils on friday, the will meet the caps in the playoffs. 	however, i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest :). first of all, with the islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the whalers, one may think that the islanders are out of shape. these guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon. it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost. anyway, the games was pretty wide open. the isles still have tons of trouble scoring. the whalers played a golie in is 1st nhl start, i think his name was lenarduzzi (sp?). (his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles). like i mentioned before, this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot). i say it's because the isles don't shoot correctly. has anyone else noticed this? 	also, i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does. this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald (who did play hockey, i think). anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. and he's a defenseman. he's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. this guy gets beaten all the time. why the need for such "enforcers"? not only do fights slow the game down alot, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game. i'll be one of the few to admit, i do enjoy a good fight once in a while, but only when it's "called for". you know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard. in other words, a violation of "hockey ethics" might cause you to get puched. but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot? i mean come on already. i'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it. ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess. trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place. just my honest opinion, gary at hofstra accgsg@vaxb.hofstra.edu accgsg@hofstra.bitnet

you might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak. that pens streak is a playoff streak (tied by the chicago blackhawks, who had won 11 in a row until they met the pens in the finals last year) the 18 game unbeaten, so far, is a regular season unbeaten streak. but hey, don't take it personally. i'm a flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch. but with a healthy lindros, recchi, brind'amour and tommy soderstrom, they'll be there next year! by the way, since the flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade would anybody suggest from the existing flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that terry carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook paper would be better defense. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- matt weaver (properly found at ajs147@psuvm.psu.edu). hey, at least we're not the whalers!

well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs. let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps st.louis. that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting none. for the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again. then bring pitt. and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go. brian

1st round: ---------- pitt vs nyi: pitt in 4. it looks like a safe bet. nyi has been bagging it of late. nyi and njd have a showdown friday night for the honour of pittsburg anyway. pigsburg in 4. wash vs njd: wash in 6. i think that njd have a solid team and will compete with wash. i agree though with wash in 6. bos vs buf: bos in 5. the b's have been playing awesome hockey in the last two weeks. the only question is how long will it last? fuhr is a dud. bos in 4. que vs mon: mon in 7. it seems to me that mon is much like the van - no chemistry. the habs seem to be not in stride. que in 5. chi vs stl: chi in 4. stl should not be in the playoffs. chi in 4. det vs tor: det in 6. i am a diehard leaf fan but ... it seems that the leafs offense is shutting down in the last week. can they turn it around against detroit. as i recall, the last couple of time these two teams met, the leafs were pummelled. i don't know if bobbie is allowed in canada yet. if he is, det in 5. if not, det in 6. van vs win: win in 6. upset in the making here. another team with bad chemistry. there is something gone foul among linden, momesso and bure. win in 6. cal vs la: cal in 5. anybody that says that la could possibly beet cal does not watch the smythe a whole lot. la is a bunch of geritols. cal in 4. 2nd round: ---------- pitt vs wash: pitt in 4. it seems to me that pigsburg has some egos on their team. their saving grace though is bowman. he can put anybody in their place. however, if pigs have a quick first round, they may be a little too high. wash could be there for a surprise. having said that, i will say pitt in 6. bos vs mon: bos in 6. mon will not be there. bos is surprising me of late. cam is great. the couple of wins against que last week have sold me with the b's. b's in 6. chi vs det: chi in 7. yikes. this will not be pretty. but det is running like a machine of late. they've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played like killers. det in 6. win vs cal: cal in 5. cal has a solid team, a little weak in the nets. cal will out muscle win. cal in 5. 3rd round: ---------- pitt vs bos: pitt in 5. i hate pitt. my logic eludes me. the dark side will take over and give bos the extra push it needs to dump pitt. there may be something to this - if you think of the rivalry. bos in 7. chi vs cal: chi in 5. finals: ------ pitt vs chi: pitt in 5. no, no, no. we have bos vs det. i don't know what to say here. both teams will be flying and overdue. i will go with goaltending and muscle and say det in 7. -jake.

derian hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the nhl, allowing the minnesota defenseman to play in the north stars' last two regular-season games. hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at st. louis on sunday, april 11. but the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty shane churla received. the stars recalled center cal mcgowan from their top minor league club in kalamazoo, mich., to replace churla. the above is courtesy of the washington times on-line service. now, here's where i need help. if anyone out there has a tape of tuesday's chicago-minnesota game, please contact me. terms will be favorable. also, if anyone can tape tonight's minnesota-detroit game, please contact me. this could be quite important. once again, i will make it worth your trouble. thanks to all. -- rec.sport.hockey contact for minnesota north stars and maintainer of the r.s.h faq file mitch mcgowan a.k.a. | kalamazoo wings | minnesota north stars | hamlet@u.washington.edu | st. kilda saints | toronto blue jays |

everybody. please send me your predictions for the stanley cup playoffs! i want to see who people think will win.!!!!!!! please send them in this format, or something comparable: 1. winner of buffalo-boston 2. winner of montreal-quebec 3. winner of pittsburgh-new york 4. winner of new jersey-washington 5. winner of chicago-(minnesota/st.louis) 6. winner of toronto-detroit 7. winner of vancouver-winnipeg 8. winner of calgary-los angeles 9. winner of adams division (1-2 above) 10. winner of patrick division (3-4 above) 11. winner of norris division (5-6 above) 12. winner of smythe division (7-8 above) 13. winner of wales conference (9-10 above) 14. winner of campbell conference (11-12 above) 15. winner of stanley cup (13-14 above) i will summarize the predictions, and see who is the biggest internet guru predicting guy/gal. send entries to richard madison rrmadiso@napier.uwaterloo.ca ps: i will send my entries to one of you folks so you know when i say i won, that i won!!!!! :)
the hawks won the norris div, and sealed their fate. it's bad luck to win the norris. the hawks will sweep the blues in their dreams but will lose in 6 in reality. i predict that in the 6 game with the blues belfour will go down on his knees 7000 time s and will spend the rest of the time looking behind him self. butcher will pound roenick and the warthawks have no one tough enough to prevent it bye bye wart hawks
smythe division --------------- vancouver vs. winnipeg - jets in 7 the jets have played the canucks tough the last three games. everyone is healthy for the jets. i'm biased. :) calgary vs. los angeles - flames in 6 from what i have seen, the kings have looked flat lately. i just can't see them getting by the flames. final- jets in 6. the jets haven't lost to the flames in '93. they will, but it will be a close series that will come down to how well roberts has recovered. i don't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough. norris division --------------- chicago vs. st. louis/minnesota chicago in 6 against the blues, 7 against the stars. detroit vs. toronto - wings in 6. the wings should be able to shutdown gilmour and andreychuk. chelvadae is more experienced than potvin. final - hawks in 7. brutal series. probert and chelios will go at it. belfour is better than chelvadae, imho. conference final - hawks in 6. it hurts, but the hawks are more experienced, and that will carry them through to the final. prince of wales conference -------------------------- adams division -------------- boston vs. buffalo - bruins in 6. b's can check, juneau is darn good, and neely. the sabres rely too much on lafontaine and mogilny. quebec vs. montreal - montreal in 7. classic battle, the inexperience will hurt the nords, this year. final - bruins in 5. habs will be hurting from their series with the nords, and boston has been able to control the scorers on the habs. patrick division ---------------- pittsburgh vs islanders/devils - pens in 5. one word. mario. washington vs. devils/islanders - caps in 6 / devils in 7. i think the caps can beat the isles, but not the devils. tabaracci has been strong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team. it doesn't matter, though. final - pens in 5. two more words. stevens. jagr. cup final - pens in 6. three last words. tocchet. murphy. barrasso. the only thing i don't like about this is that the pens woofers are going to be out in full force again. (i don't mean the regular penguin fans...it's just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post like nuts while the jets are winning, but we won't hear from again when they lose.)

the flyers closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 ot winner over the hartford whalers. the ot game winner came from dimitri yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. the flyers never led up until that point in the game. for the whalers, the loss marked an nhl record 9th ot loss this season. roster move: gord hynes was called to to play in place of ryan mcgill injuries: ryan mcgill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched. lines: eklund-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy faust-acton-brown galley-bowen yushkevich-hawgood carkner-hynes dominic roussel game summary: i didn't get tv coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts i didn't have the best radio coverage either. here's the box score followed by a few things i did pick up: first period: 	hartford, nylander 10, 8:51 	philadelphia, recchi 53 (lindros, brind'amour), 19:59.8 (pp) penalties - verbeek, har (holding), :55; carkner, phi (roughing), 13:53; houda, har (interference) 18:43 second period: 	hartford, burt 6 (cunneyworth, kron), 2:00 	philadelphia, bowen 1 (eklund, recchi), 7:09 	hartford, nylander 11 (zalapski, sanderson), 9:38 penalties - galley, phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; verbeek, har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; brown, phi (tripping), 3:22; zalapski, har (tripping), 15:51; brind'amour, phi (slashing), 19:50 third period: 	hartford, kron 14 (sanderson, cassels), 1:24 (pp) 	philadelphia, beranek 15 (lomakin, yushkevich), 3:11 	philadelphia, faust 2 (brind'amour, roussel), 3:38 penalties - houda, har (tripping), 4:20; hawgood, phi (holding), 5:30 overtime: 	philadelphia, yushkevich 5 (faust), 1:15. penalties - none power play: 	philadelphia 1 of 4, hartford 1 of 4 goalies: 	philadelphia, roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) 	hartford, lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33) on the first hartford goal, gord hynes misplayed the puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off. the recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with lindros. the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie. on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense. take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. don't give them another chance. carkner, galley and mcgill are all terrible about this, i'll bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play. that's all i have, my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how. from what i heard, roussel had a very strong game. after the game, gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. it was garry galley #3 for his career high point total (i'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), tommy soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, mark recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. but here's the odd part. he couldn't decide between lindros and recchi for number 1. if he picks recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros, doesn't that make lindros #2???? what? you wanna know my three stars of the season? well, since you asked... #1 eric lindros. eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. the difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi. there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it, and i think that he will deservedly wear the 'c' on his jersey next season. #2 tommy soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour, and tommy didn't have a chris chelios (booo) in front of him. he also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). there's no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years. #3 mark recchi. again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. there are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. plus, mark is the only flyer to play the entire season. not a tough choice. honorable mentions: rod brind'amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. the difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either. dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. i have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and i suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come. garry galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. again, there are some things you just can't argue with. and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. a little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year. brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. but consistency became a problem for him. a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members: tom misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange e-mail addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer. if you're interested, you can send him mail at: att!acr.org!tmisnik the flyers end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in patrick), 23-14-5 at home. they finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (quebec had the 1st rounder, though). they scored as many goals as they allowed, 319. the 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985. i will be sending out final stats as soon as i get the issue of the hockey news that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to i have no other way of getting them. i hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as i have. knowing the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time almost bearable. flyers team record watch: eric lindros: 41 goals, 34 assists, 75 points (rookie records) club record goals:			club record points: eric lindros	40 1992-93		dave poulin	76 1983-84 brian propp	34 1979-80		brian propp	75 1979-80 ron flockhart	33 1981-82		eric lindros	75 1992-93 dave poulin	31 1983-84		ron flockhart	72 1981-82 bill barber	30 1972-73		pelle eklund	66 1985-86 mark recchi: 53 goals, 70 assists, 123 points. club record goals:			club record points: reggie leach	61 1975-76		mark recchi	123 1992-93* tim kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	bobby clarke	119 1975-76 tim kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	bobby clarke	116 1974-75 mark recchi	53 1992-93*		bill barber	112 1975-76 rick macliesh	50 1972-73		bobby clarke	104 1972-73 bill barber	50 1975-76		rick macliesh	100 1972-73 reggie leach	50 1979-80 *more than 80 games. flyers career years: player		points	best prior season mark recchi	123	113 (90-91 penguins) rod brind'amour	86	77 (91-92 flyers) garry galley	62	38 (84-85 kings) brent fedyk	59	35 (90-91 red wings) that's all for now... pete clark jr - rsh flyers contact and mailing list owner

i found this press release from trial lawyers for public justice on another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses where the administration or the athletics department wants to eliminate the women's ice hockey team. women athletes, tlp win sex discrimination ruling: brown university ordered to restore two women's varsity teams to: national desk, sports writer contact: lynette labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or ray marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of trial lawyers for public justice washington, april 16 -- the u.s. court of appeals for the first circuit in boston has upheld a u.s. district court order requiring brown university to immediately reinstate its women's gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. the ruling in cohen et al. v. brown university is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying title ix to intercollegiate athletics. trial lawyers for public justice (tlpj), is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes. "this ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams," said tlpj executive director arthur bryant, co-counsel in the case. the class action, filed april, 1992, charged brown with violating title ix of the education amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds. brown terminated the two women's teams as university-funded sports in may 1991, allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses. they had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members. "this is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights," said tlpj lead counsel lynette labinger of providence's roney & labinger. "universities across america need to reevaluate their programs quickly. title ix is the law and it's going to be enforced." three similar title ix appeals await decision. colorado state university, indiana university of pennsylvania (iup), and colgate university are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity teams. continuing its cutting-edge title ix activities, tlpj is representing women athletes at iup. in addition to labinger and bryant, tlpj's legal team included: ray marcaccio of blish & cavanagh and amato deluca of mandell, deluca & schwartz in providence; and sandra duggan of philadelphia. the national women's law center, women's sports foundation, and national association for girls and women in sports filed an amicus brief in support of tlpj's appeal. -30-

un, you better add at least another plus to the pederson for neely trade, the bruins also received a number 1 round draft pick, didn't play great this year but wesley's still a decent defenseman.... and the bruins got pederson back eventually anyway..... pat ellis p.s. go bruins go umaine black bears 42-1-2 number 1...... hockey east regulars season champions..... hockey east tournament champions>...... paul kariya, hobey baker award winner....... ncaa div. 1 hockey tournament champions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! m-a-i-n-e ggggooooooo bbbllluueeee!
well i just read in the boston globe that while not confirming (or denying) anything, walsh may end up with the rangers organizations as an (assistant coach?). keenan has talked with walsh in the past (he came up to see kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds, funny i guess he got to watch the ferraro brothers as well.....) i'm not sure if walsh will go, but if keenan is getting 700,000 and walsh even gets 100,000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention a nice career move....) anyone from new york hear anything about this???????? pat ellis p.s. go bruins go umaine black bears 42-1-2 number 1...... hockey east regulars season champions..... hockey east tournament champions>...... paul kariya, hobey baker award winner....... ncaa div. 1 hockey tournament champions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! m-a-i-n-e ggggooooooo bbbllluueeee!

i got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown away. i am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between april 5 and april 17. it looks like about 200 entries got lost. *sigh*. therefore, i would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend it asap. i am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the deadline today. thanks in advance, and i apologize for the problem. -- andrew scott | andrew@idacom.hp.com hp idacom telecom operation | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253 during the roman era, 28 was considered old...

the blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the chicago blackhawks 4-3 sunday afternoon at chicago stadium. brendan shanahan tied the game 3-3 and brett hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. jeff brown and denny felsner scored the other blues goals. brian noonan had the hat trick for the hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from ed belfour. blues goalie curtis joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the blues lead. the hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on noonan's first goal. right after an interference penalty on rick zombo had expired, keith brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to steve larmer in the right circle. larmer fired a long slap shot, and noonan deflected the puck between joseph's pads. after the goal, the blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the hawks 10-9 in the first period. jeff brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. nelson emerson broke in on the left side, got by craig muni and pushed the puck across the slot. belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where brown collected it and slapped it in before belfour could get back to the goal. two minutes later on a hawks power play, belfour stopped rich sutter on a short-handed break-in. chris chelios picked up the puck and passed it to jeremy roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open noonan with a nice pass across the slot. noonan fired it past joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead. noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the hawks' lead to 3-1. stephane matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to noonan who beat stephane quintal by driving to the net. joseph had no chance as noonan deflected the puck in the net. denny felsner reduced the blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of basil mcrae's slap shot from the slot. janney set up mcrae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to felsner. felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. the blues outshot the hawks 10-5 in the second period. with the blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, stephane matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. just 53 seconds into the power play, steve smith was called for slashing, giving the blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07. the blues didn't waste time as brendan shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. janney found hull in the slot, and hull fired a rocket at belfour. jeff brown collected the rebound and passed it to shanahan in the left circle. shanahan beat belfour from a sharp angle. just 17 seconds later, hull scored the game winner for the blues. nelson emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two hawks defensemen. emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked hull in the slot, and hull beat belfour to put the blues up 4-3. the hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the hawks from scoring. he stopped troy murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. the blues killed off a late hawks power play, with rich sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. the blues held on to win the game. the hawks oushot the blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. the blues special teams were excellent in the game. the blues killed 6 of 7 hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. the blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. they rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play. the game was carried live on abc, the first time an nhl game other than an all-star game has been shown on network television since may 24, 1980, when cbs carried game 6 of the stanley cup finals. the best-of-seven series continues wednesday in chicago and friday and sunday in st. louis. box score --------- blues 4, blackhawks 3 blues 0 2 2 -- 4 chicago 1 2 0 -- 3 first period chi -- noonan 1 (larmer, k.brown), 8:17. penalties -- shanahan, stl (holding), 2:28;

i hear daigle will eb the first pick next year. what is the word on kariya??? anybody ever seen him play on tv???? is he also entering the draft???
the mission to revive hockey at umass is now underway. at the 4 pm saturday afternoon press conference held at the new mullins center arena - former boston college asst. coach joe mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year contract as head coach for the umass minutemen. mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind jeff jackson (lake superior) and second behind shawn walsh (umaine). previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of brown, rpi and the head coach of the ahl springfield indians. umass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team's position over a period of years. in late november of last year, the $52 million mullins sports center was opened following its one year construction deadline. the minutemen are slated to play an independent div ii/div iii schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering hockey east for the winter 1994 season. mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within new england, the bay state and europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the university. umass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as i hear more from my sources. .... j.d. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ jim doyle 	univ. of massachusetts - dept. of computer science staff programmer	puma/dcc/cnet	 email:	doyle@gaia.cs.umass.edu office:		lederle grc room a203	 tel. 413-545-3179 home :		91 blackberry ln tel. 413-549-1409 		amherst,ma 01002-1516

well put, jason. i am not from wisconsin, but i have close relatives who live in port washington (about 30 minutes north of milwaukee), i visit the city regularly, and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals play and the ncaa hockey championships. it is a beautiful building. the pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in north america. as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown county arena. once again, the admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of milwaukee have been supporting them well. the games i have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some nhl teams (i.e. the islanders, hartford, new jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city. sincerely, martin hill, rt. 2, box 155b, sault ste. marie, mi (home of lssu: go lakers!) p.s. anybody know what the attendance figures are for the ihl and how milwaukee stacks up against other ihl cities such as atlanta, phoenix, san diego, cleveland, and cincinnati? if so, please reply.

(oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so i can say "the opponent".) a team gets two points for a win. so, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties. another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties. the first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points. the second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points. wow! they *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different! how did they do that??!?!?!?! that's amazing. so, rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means. in our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams had the same number of points. if you didn't understand this post, rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) -- keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 						let's go quakers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!!

well, it's not that bad. but i am still pretty pissed of at the local abc coverage. they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing david brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. i don't even understand their problem. if they didnt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? and if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play david brinkley at its regular time? they dont have any decent programming before noon anyway. i called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine. i called gain and someone picked it up. when i asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the stanley cup playoffs, he seemed a bit confused. when i explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto to our programming dept. call back on monday. weel, i understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption. but i can't understand how someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for. anyway, i am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again. i urge all atlanta hockey fans to call wsb 2 and ask them not to do the same thing for the next 4 weeks. -pravin ratnam(oh by the way, pens rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon, dropping a 6-3 decision to the la kings. most of the flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the kings hit at least five posts! the flames best line was probably skrudland-paslawski-berube (which tells how bad the flames were). gary suter scored a great goal (in fact all three flame goals were scored by d-men - yawney and dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. for the kings, pat conacher was especially impressive. the games was very chippy, as dan mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out warren rychel from behind. flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (i don't think vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). calgary went with 7 d-men, as roger johansson played lw; he looked lost imho - i hope king inserts chris lindbergh, paul kruse, or sergei makarov for wednesday's game. gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return. i still think the flames should win this series, but they better buckle down. - vlad the impaler
well, i have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool. there are unofficially 52 entrants. here are the stats on what teams were picked to win it all: pittsburgh:	34 (1 sweep, 14 in 5, 15 in 6, 4 in 7) boston:		6 (1 in 5, 5 in 6) detroit:	4 (3 in 6, 1 in 7) montreal:	2 (1 in 5, 1 in 7) toronto:	2 (1 in 6, 1 in 7) (no, this wasn't roger) calgary:	1 (in 6) quebec:		1 (in 6) vancouver:	1 (in 7) washington:	1 (in 6) why the hell hasn't anybody picked chicago??? nobody! quebec got a pick, detroit got 4, but absolutely no chicago! how odd. here are the "losers": detroit:	20 chicago:	16	(so there they are!) pittsburgh:	6 vancouver:	4 boston:		2 calgary:	2 los angeles:	1	what?!? toronto:	1 los angeles??????? are you out of your mind?!?!? good luck to you, you'll need it! so pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the stanley cup. they'll statistically beat detroit in 6 games. haha that's happening! not! as i said, every one of my picks will come true, and i picked chicago to lose to pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket detroit. well, tough luck to all of ya! i am a genius!!! ;-) -- keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 						let's go quakers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!!

in detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. in the era of the original 6, four teams made the playoffs. to win the cup, a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8 playoff wins to win the cup. the octopus (8 legs) has become a common detroit symbol. every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus (octopi?) into the joe louis arena and throwing them onto the ice. j. old e-mail: jold@vma.cc.nd.edu
here is a summary of don cherry's coach's corner from april 18, 1993. it took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the montreal-quebec series. pre-game comments ----------------- don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... the goalie who gets back his all-star form (roy or hextall) can win the series for his team. eposode summary --------------- this episode took place rinkside. don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand. ron maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the toronto sun. it featured a picture of don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed "will you look at dat, eh? means another 6 weeks of me. beauty." next, don talked about the hot dog he was holding. according to him, the hot dogs at the quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the nhl. from there, don commented on the quebec-montreal game. the game had great flow, because referee paul stewart calls the best game in the nhl. in contrast, the calgary-la game was terrible... all stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against calgary by dan marouelli. its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals. next, ron showed an old picture of don, when he was playing for the rochester americans of the ahl. don recalled some of the wins that he had in the quebec arena... during the memorial cup and the ahl championships. finally, don and ron discussed keenan becoming coach of the rangers. the rangers were a talented team who underachieved. don feels sorry for temporary coach ron smith, who had several key injuries (to leetch and patrick) and goalies who went cold. don had some criticism for the rangers team... the party's over, adolf (keenan) is there. the rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... "ny should be achamed of themselves... if they go in the tank with adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs." rating ------ nothing too special in this episode. i'll give it a 5.5 out of 10. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \ \ |allan sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca) \ \ |department of computing science, \ \_______ |university of alberta, edmonton, alberta, canada. \ ### \ _ |--------------------------------------------------- \___###___\ (_) |my opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "it is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit..." - u. of a. golden bears hockey motto (c. drake) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

everyone keeps talking about european expansion by 2010 thinking wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball. the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe.

(we don't need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa's record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)). if hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to europe, maybe teams like the rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth division). we'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like halifax or adirondack....ok, so halifax isn't a good example) would eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division (unlike ottawa, sj, edmonton, etc.). fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams (and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup...i can dream, can't i??) look at british (or any european) soccer as an example (they never have fan problems). just someone who thinks our system really sucks barfly (feel free to flame me, my account ends today...hahahaha) 1940!!

well, the tentative rules, anyway. and, of course, since the season is not entirely over, tentative entry form. but who cares? the real hockey season is starting!!!!! here's the deal: you email (preferably) or post your predictions, and the number of games you think each series will go. each round will be weighted, so that the stanley cup finals will be very important, but the early rounds will still be important. here is the scoring: pick 1st round winner, way off on games: 2 points pick 1st round winner, within one game: 3 points pick 1st round winner, pick # of games: 5 points pick 2nd round winner, way off on games: 3 points pick 2nd round winner, within one game: 4 points pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games: 6 points pick conference champ, way off on games: 5 points pick conference champ, within one game: 6 points pick conference champ, pick # of games: 9 points pick stanley cup champ, way off on games: 8 points pick stanley cup champ, within one game: 10 points pick stanley cup champ, pick # of games: 14 points pick loser in 7, series goes 7: 2 points pick loser in 7, series decided in game 7, ot: 4 points (these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway) obviously, picking the stanley cup champion is important. i will do some tests to see if the format is fair, but probably i will be too lazy to modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this. as for entry forms, well, this post is getting too long, so see next post. -- keith keller				let's go rangers!!!!! 						let's go quakers!!!!! 	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		ivy league champs!!!!

here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the ahl this year. st john's maple leafs problems the st john's maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. on-ice, the leafs won the atlantic division title but off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-jan). they have played "home" games in places like montreal, cornwall and charlottetown. their playoff "home" games will be played in the metro center in halifax, ns. one demostration got violent. workers attacked a leafs' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the st john's memorial stadium. despite the problems, toronto officials insist that the leafs will return to st john's once the strike ends. =================================================== senators sold the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to the ottawa senators nhl organization. they are the only canadian nhl team with an american ahl affiliate, and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic provinces. this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in may. the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership, rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the ahl in new haven. the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown new brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== dallas helps hawks stay in moncton after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of moncton, the winnipeg jets changed their mind. the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise. enter the dallas lone stars. dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the moncton franchise. thus keeping the hawks in the new brunswick city. the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. the hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ saint john flames official the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of saint john, nb. the saint john blue flames will play in the 6200 exhibition center. the flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= caps follow jacks to maine despite rumors to the contrary, the capitals will follow the baltimore skipjacks to maine. the caps' current farm team, the baltimore skipjacks, announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates. there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with portland. they would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. they become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders. ====================================================== ahl game of the week in early january, the ahl started a game of the week. the game, produced by, i believe, pyman productions, was televised across the canadian maritimes and northeastern us. the first few weeks saw two games of the week, one in canada and another in the us but since then, there has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and, i believe, atlantic sports network in canada (but i'm not sure about that). i am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== utica gone? syracuse added? there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next season. there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them. ===================================================== what the ahl might look like next year one option				another option 			 northern division			southern division adirondack red wings			adirondack springfield indians			springfield providence bruins			providence cd islanders				cdi portland pirates			hershey 					binghamton southern division			rochester hershey bears				hamilton binghamton rangers			utica rochester americans hamilton canucks			atlantic division utica (?) devils			portland 					st john's atlantic division			saint john st john's maple leafs			moncton moncton hawks				halifax halifax citadels			fredericton cape breton oilers			cape breton fredericton canadiens			charlottetown saint john blue flames charlottetown senators (move is unofficial as yet) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + bri farenell			farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu + + ahl and ecac contact for rec.sport.hockey		go usa hockey!	 +	 + adirondack red wings, calder cup champs: '81 '86 '89 '92	 + + clarkson hockey, ecac tournament champ: '66 '91 '93		 + + glens falls high school, division ii ny state champs: '90 '91 	 + + join the ahl mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu 	 + + congrats to clarkson golden knights hockey: 1993 ecac champions!!! + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

i live in the desolate midwest (as far as hockey is concerned) and our "sports" stores around here carry very little hockey stuff, except for san jose, tampa bay, l.a., pittsburgh, and if you're lucky chicago. i would like to know if anyone knows of any m,ail order, phone order stores that i might be able to get in contact with. i am dying for some real hockey stuff (hats, shirts, key chains, etc.) for some other teams (edmonton, montreal, etc.) so if you have any information, please e-mail me directly. most appreciated! good luck to your teams in the stanley cup playoffs! go edmonton (likely...not!!) maybe next year... -- 	"if you assult someone you get 5 years--in hockey, 5 minutes. 			is this a great sport or what?!" kevin d. frank					kfrank@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

well bruins fans it's playoff time again. it looks like the b's have peaked at the right time. getting out of the adams is going to be a cat fight to the end. after what they did to montreal and quebec, these teams will be out for revenge. if neely can stay healthy, and both bourque and moog stay sharp, we should get to see neely finally take out two years of frustration on ulf (i don't fight) samuelson. i don't agree with fighting in the nhl, but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him. this is going to be a good series, go bruins!!!! rchard richard@amc.com

as the sharks' season came to a close tonight, i will start a series of posts, trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through for the sharks for the past season. if you are uninterested, since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them. i will first try to evaluate how the players did. these ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible. i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and/or did not play for another nhl team this season. thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders... #1	brian hayward		season:	11th acquired:	'91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		p (d) it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies (with patrick roy, in '87, '88, and '89). it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie. but hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the sharks' first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames. as he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was. #30	jeff hackett		season: 3rd acquired:	'91-92, from n. y. islanders in expansion draft grade:		c hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team mvp honors last season, simply wasted the year. other than a few good spots (57 saves against los angeles, almost-shutout against tampa bay, etc.), hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 gaa, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season. he was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task. he may not return next year. #31	wade flaherty		season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent grade:		i (a-) it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the calgary flames), flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods. he started the season poorly in kansas city, but finished strong, prompting the blades' owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors. the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl; last year, he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year, because with prospects dan ryder, trevor robins, and scott cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he may not ever. #32	arturs irbe		season:	1st acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		b+ i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide nhl goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender. he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had, getting the team's first ever shut-out against the los angeles kings on december 26. he has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young ron hextall (except, of course, the goonism). yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts. =============================================================================== go calgary flames! al macinnis for norris! gary roberts for hart and smythe! go edmonton oilers! go for playoffs next year! stay in edmonton! =============================================================================== nelson lu (claudius@leland.stanford.edu) rec.sport.hockey contact for the san jose sharks

played in scandinavium, gothenburg, april 15 1993: ================================================== sweden - finland 6-6 (1-2,3-1,2-3) 1st: swe 1-0 peter popovic (markus naslund) 6:10 fin 1-1 ville siren (keijo sailynoja) 8:44 (pp) fin 1-2 juha riihijarvi (timo saarikoski,vesa viitakoski) 13:12 (pp) 2nd: fin 1-3 jari korpisalo (kari harila,rauli raitanen) 6:48 swe 2-3 jan larsson (mikael renberg,stefan nilsson) 7:25 swe 3-3 hakan ahlund (thomas rundqvist) 8:56 swe 4-3 roger akerstrom (roger hansson) 9:13 3rd: swe 5-3 stefan nilsson (patrik juhlin,charles berglund) 2:20 fin 5-4 keijo sailynoja 9:23 fin 5-5 keijo sailynoja 9:44 (ps) swe 6-5 mikael renberg (hakan ahlund,thomas rundqvist) 17:16 fin 6-6 jari korpisalo 17:44 shots on goal: penalties: attendance: referee: sweden 8 10 10 - 28 5*2min 6,799 peter andersson finland 12 10 11 - 33 6*2min,1*10min (sweden) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- sweden opened the scoring as markus naslund made a drop pass at the finnish blue line, popovic picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and shot a nice hard wrist shot in ketterer's top corner. ville siren's slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and juha riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over aslin, 1-2 after the first period. the finns started the second period with really good pressure. korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over aslin. then, during the finnish pressure, sweden turned the game around in 1:47. mikael renberg worked hard behind the finnish goal, and passed the puck to jan larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. rundqvist entered the finnish zone and passed to ahlund, and the finnish defense let ahlund skate in and take a shot that ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3. next, roger hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where roger akerstrom took a slap shot and ketterer didn't see the puck since there was traffic in front, 4-3. third period started with a nice goal by stefan "the shadow" nilsson. stefan and patrik juhlin entered the finnish zone, patrik passed the puck back to stefan who alone with ketterer made no mistake, 5-3. then, keijo sailynoja show started. he reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds! first he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone with aslin but was tripped by aslin to get a penalty shot. sailynoja made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. the swedes seemed to head for a win when mikael renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. renberg waited in the slot, showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, ahlund passed the puck and renberg took a turnaround shot low in ketterer's goal's far side. but jari korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game's final goal to make it 6-6. korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- aslin should have saved. all in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best. both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations. renberg and rundqvist plays well together in the swedish team. larsson- nilsson-juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working wc line. stillman good on defense. some players aren't good enough for the wc though. hakan ahlund (faell ner hjaelmen och jobba!), roger hansson, challe berglund, kenny jonsson will likely have to leave for nhl pros. two-goal scorers jari korpisalo and keijo sailynoja played well in the finnish team. markus ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him a lot better, so lindfors is probably finland's starting goalie in the wc. i heard that esa tikkanen will join the finnish team. it would be inter- resting to know which other pros coach matikainen counts on for the wc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- starting lines: 	sweden					finland 35. peter aslin			30. markus ketterer 8. kenneth kennholt			 2. mikko haapakoski 14. fredrik stillman			 3. ville siren 10. hakan ahlund			28. jarkko varvio 9. thomas rundqvist			40. mika nieminen 29. mikael renberg 			18. keijo sailynoja 27. roger akerstrom			 4. erik hamalainen 7. arto blomsten			 8. kari harila 20. jan larsson 	 		25. rauli raitanen 4. stefan nilsson 			26. petri varis 5. patrik juhlin			14. jari korpisalo 3. peter popovic			 5. timo jutila 32. stefan larsson			44. harri laurila 11. roger hansson			24. juha riihijarvi 33. fredrik nilsson			22. timo saarikoski 24. peter ottosson			11. vesa viitakoski 					 6. pasi sormunen 					12. janne laukkanen 19. markus naslund			29. juha ylonen 21. peter forsberg			27. timo peltomaa 18. jonas bergqvist			17. marko palo played parts of the game: 22. charles berglund			15. mika alatalo 6. kenny jonsson			16. saku koivu 					20. marko palo ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- ((\\ //| staffan axelsson \\ //|| etxonss@ufsa.ericsson.se \\_))//-|| r.s.h. contact for swedish hockey

"deeply rooted rivalry?" ahem, jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early '70s. helsingfors ifk have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so i think you're exagerating here. > however, it's been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team > - that's "the finnish national team". maybe that's how you could set up a > huge franchise in finland. no one has ever said that the team must be > called after one city or play all its games on one arena. just one team > finland and team sweden in the nhl just wouldn't make any sense - we have > way more talent than 1/24th of the total of north american talent. after a > couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the > nordic (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting > local talent, as prooposed). that's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the canadian & american olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. the 1992 olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. canada had eric lindros, sean burke, joe juneau and chris kontos. another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl. as for the yanks, keith tkachuk, scott lachance, bret hedican, shawn mceachern, steve heintze, ted donato, joe sacco and bill guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the nhl, while robb stauber has done well for the kings in goal. nothing more. in fact, i'm sure that an all-star team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently are doing. --- but what happens if _all_ top-class finnish & swedish players gradually end up with helsinki & stockholm as the north american-based ones gradually retire and no canadian/american team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia? here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhl-based players: (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=nhl regular+) (13-17=nhl regular) ( 8-12=role player) finland: d-jyrki lumme.......20 d-teppo numminen....20 d-peter ahola.......13 c-jari kurri........25 c-christian ruuttu..16 r-teemu selanne.....27 l-esa tikkanen......20 (obviously, selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in january) sweden: d-ulf samuelsson....21 d-fredrik olausson..20 d-niklas lidstrom...18 d-calle johansson...18 d-kjell samuelsson..17 d-tommy sjodin......13 d-tommy albelin......7 c-mats sundin.......26 c-thomas steen......18 r-thomas sandstrom..22 r-ulf dahlen........18 r-michael nylander..13 l-per-erik eklund...18 l-johan garpenlov...16 l-mikael andersson..15 l-jan erixon........14 this would be interesting. clearly, finland's top five players (winnipeg's selanne & numminen, vancouver's lumme, los angeles' jari kurri and new york's tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit pittsburgh & co. have. but i have my doubts about the home-based finnish players - the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. there's presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl. --- sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america. their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than ottawa's 22 top players combined! if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in sweden, an all-swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. deducting some points from pittsburgh, ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players, the swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as boston, vancouver, calgary and montreal on paper! so, the "dynasty" talk isn't completely unfounded here. an all-finnish/all-swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game. however, if free agency becomes a factor the top scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way edmonton's "dynasty" crumbled in the late '80s. some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. i'd settle for a compromise, prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. after this, the amateur draft should be open to anyone. > ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- > j o o j o o j o k e r i t ! ! ! finland over czech in the final > b r u i n p o w e r ! ! ! bruins over blackhawks in 6 > ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- marcu$

a fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the minnesota north stars, or norm's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of 5-3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen, who netted two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to play. tonight, on the air on the stars tv telecast, announcer al shaver, the voice of the north stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to dallas. shaver, when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him), "what will you do now?" responded, "first i'm going to get me a new pair of slippers. then i'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by." thank you north stars, and thank you al shaver, for 26 years of minnesota memories. joel alvstad

the new name is florida panthers. the panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the everglades. a couple of years ago, there were license plates made with panthers on them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund). the name of the new president of the panthers should be announced today. as of yesterday's paper, huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at the miami arena this fall. the team has a guaranteed two-year lease with the arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999. "it's not our choice", james blosser, a lawyer and huizenga aid said about ruling out the arena as a long term option. "the nhl told us we can't stay there. it's not economically feasible." one reason is because the miami heat basketball team controls skybox and advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit potential. the hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from broward, dade, and palm beach counties. a leading site is vacant land near joe robbie stadium, where residents 10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending an eight-year battle of wills. compliments of the news/sun-sentinel. jim g. "fitz...sanchez...castranova..."
as i promised, i would give you the name of the panther's president. after huizenga announced the team name, he announced that bill torrey is named the first president of the panthers. a little bio from _sun-sentinel_ torrey, the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as persident and general manager of the new york islanders. throughout his 27 years in the nhl, bill torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as andre agassi's hair. the panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price information in early next month. in the meantime, huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke, the vp and gm. the florida panthers was chosen as the name of south florida's nhl team to focus attention on an endangered species. there are 30 to 50 florida panthers in the everglades national park, the big cypress national preserve and other parts of southwestern florida. "the panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," torrey said. "hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice." more bio: in torrey, huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the islanders to four consecutive stanley cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons. as executive vice president of the california golden seals, torrey watched the seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second nhl season. "i guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said torrey, 58, a native of montreal but a resident of bear lakes country club in palm beach. jim g. other accounts: gorycki@sol.cse.fau.edu jimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu -------------------------------------------------------------------- "i repeat myself when under stress. i repeat myself when under stress. i repeat myself when under stress. i repeat myself when under stress. i repeat..." adrian belew, "indicipline" ---------------------------------------------------------------------

so what's the deal with bill wirtz? apparently, the blackhawks - st. louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the hawks reported the attendace as 16,199. gee, i wonder if wirtz is planning to use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv? what a schmuck. in other tv news, the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3 fewer broadcast tv games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of subscription / pay-per-view system. yuck. ralph

(detroit, april 19) in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the detroit redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the nhl, the toronto maple leafs. the leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. only the biased officiating of andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the wings by the league's best team. 							 alan p.s. this is sweet, roger. so sweet. i look forward to the next installment on wednesday night. i trust you do, too.

and now, i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics: i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season.

	there was apparently a 30 minute special here on the penguins' season on abc (wtae - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening game against the devils on sunday. i only turned it on in time to watch the credits. if anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow it to dub it, i would appreciate it. i would be willing to come pick it up, and i'll return it the next day and buy you a beer. please respond via e-mail. thanks a lot. 	oh yeah. was it any good? 						-billy

us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition. i (and i'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away. basically, all we need are goal scorers and assists, don't bother with times, penalties, shots etc... this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very happy. i guess with the senators out golfing now, the local papers have lost interest. ;-) thanks. kd. --

1992-93 los angeles kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- kings 6 @ calgary flames 3 - 04/18/93 the third place kings opened the 1993 stanley cup playoffs in calgary, against the second place flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the saddledome in calgary. symthe division playoff hockey this was. both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the kings scored off the opening face-off. the kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the flames as they played out- standing team defense. it took the flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal. the kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the flames. the flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities. the kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries. the kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the flames up at the blue line, allowing the kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the flames. rob blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on wednesday. wayne gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg. he took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game. interviewed on the radio this morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on wednesday. 1st period: 1-0. the kings got things started right off the opening face-off. gretzky won the draw with the puck going to sydor. he crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the flames zone and behind the net. the puck carried around to the far side where robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to sandstrom. he put the puck behind the flames net where gretzky picked it up. gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where sydor had moved in. sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark, shot off the pass, beating vernon low and between the legs. millen and fleury went off at 4:57. skrudland went off at 12:25 but the kings failed to convert. carson went off at 14:53 and the flames failed to convert. dahlquist went off at 18:34 and dahl went off at 19:30, giving the kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert. the kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period. 2nd period: the kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on. with 6 seconds left in the 5on4, vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game. 1-1. calgary evened the score on the ensuing kings power play. kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the flames zone but it hit the stick of fleury and bounced to suter at the flames blue line. suter skated down the near wing and into the kings zone. he faked a shot at the circle and skated around kurri. as he cut thorugh the crease, he got hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander. 2-1. the kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. shuchuk, in the far circle passed to sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net. sydors shot hit shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 kings (shuchuk and granato) were being checked by 3 flames. carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of vernon from 5 feet above the crease. 3-1. the kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later. rychel was checked off the puck at the flames blue line. taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to huddy. huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving vernon on the glove side. 4-1. 2:59 later, the kings had a 3 goal lead. mcsorley took a shot form the near point that hit a flame and deflected towards the boards. marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of vernon. skrudland went off at 10:53 but the kings could not convert. sydor went off at 12:35 and watters went off at 14:40, giving the flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert. mcsorley went off at 17:19 and the flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the flames killed it themselves when suter went off for high sticking at 17:31. sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period. the kings hit 3 goal post in the period. 3rd period: the kings used the phrase "initiate, not retaliate" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the kings continued to pound the body and the flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game. 5-1. the kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark. the kings shot the puck into the near corner of the flames zone. vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it. donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot. as vernon slid back in to the crease, granato got a shot that hit a flame and bounced to the left of the net where millen fired the rebound behind vernon. sydor went off at 1:24; nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4. 5-2. otto, skating down the far side, stepped around mcsorley, cut to the net and passed to dahlquist in the low slot. dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving hrudey. carson and rychel came in on a 2-1. when carson passed across to rychel, fleury tripped rychel with no call. the puck got shoveled into the far corner where fleury knocked rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark. unfortunately, the kings squandered the 5 minute power play when granato (at 6:44) and watters (at 8:19) took penalties. 5-3. the flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark. macinnis, at the near point, passed to yawney at the far point. he took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of hrudey. the play started on another faceoff that the kings lost. timeout - la. 6-3. macinnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the kings converted on the power play to seal the victory. sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the flames zone cut towards the back of the net. just as he crossed the goal line, he passed the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to carson who shot off the pass, beating vernon on the ice, stick side. at the 16:17 mark, skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he went after shuchuk. stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the flames right out of the game. on the plus side: the kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let calgary retaliate. the kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing. on the minus side: the kings lost almost every face-off. this must improve or the flames will surely get that power play back on track. notes: ------ the kings recalled guy leveque, brandy semchuk and jim thomson from phoenix. wayne gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point. the kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game. flames goaltender mike vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon games. the flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games. the teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

(i'd love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso.) mom.

apparently, part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when i posted it; to make things worse, i lost my own copy. i have asked on the sharks mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy back. if someone responds, i will repost it when i get it; otherwise, i will re-write it in a day or two and post it. sorry about that. #8	larry depalma		season:	3rd acquired:	'91-92, free agent from minnesota grade:		i (c-/d+) no netter/fan watching the sharks, including me, knows where depalma was at the end of the season; the sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in san jose, he wasn't in kansas city, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire. and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma. after being called up october 30 against the tampa bay lightning, depalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense. unfortunately, the 27-year-old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice. he then was sent down to kansas city, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes (as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials) faithful, and neither the sharks nor we miss him. #10	johan garpenlov		season: 3rd acquired:	'91-92, trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 8th round 		pick in '92 entry draft from vancouver grade:		a/a- after an early slump, garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau. kisio got most of the credit, but garpenlov, finishing second in the mvp voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals. contrary to his previous rep, garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet. he also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season. he will be a major key to the offense next year. #15	david bruce		season: 5th acquired:	'91-92, from st. louis in expansion draft grade:		i (?) after a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season. of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well. the injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the sharks next season appears clouded. #18	mark pederson		season:	3rd acquired:	'92-93, trade with philadelphia for c/lw dave snuggerud grade:		i (b) it is difficult for me to understand the flyers' decision to unload pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the flyers and the sharks. he was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points). but when healthy, pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed. he also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, pederson can do. #20	john carter		season: 4th acquired:	'91-92, free agent from boston grade:		i (b+/b) carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice. however, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about 20 games left in the season. carter, who will turn 30 on may 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties. he is very unlikely to be back next season. #28	jean-francois quintin	season: 1st acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		i (b+/b) i don't understand why the sharks didn't let quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season. he was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular nhl duty, at least for a team like the sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability. shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the sharks and the blades that season, but he looked impressive. he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season. #41	mark beaufait		season: 1st acquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft grade:		i (?) after a all-star season at kansas city, beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far. despite small size (5' 9", 165 lbs.), beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 nhl games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city. #42	jaroslav otevrel	season: 1st acquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft grade:		i (?) like beaufait, otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season. he was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games. he may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready. #44	michel picard		season: 1st acquired:	'92-93, trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade:		i (b-/c+) the 23-year-old picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city. he was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the nhl, although he has been given limited opportunities. he may be the sharks' bait in the expansion draft. #45	dody wood		season: 1st acquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft grade:		i (d+/d, although perhaps i shouldn't give a grade at all) i have been accused of knocking on wood too much. :-) then, it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example. he was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season. he's not ready, and needs at least another season at kc, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else. his relatively small size (5' 11", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer. =============================================================================== go calgary flames! al macinnis for norris! gary roberts

i finally got it back, with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it. #2	rob zettler		season:	4th acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		c/c- zettler gave the sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler, if that. he works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games). he would be hardpressed to make the team next year. #3	david williams		season: 2nd acquired:	'91-92, free agent from new jersey grade:		c/c- imo, williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense. but he, playing the first part of this season in kansas city, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke. although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year. he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year. #4	jayson more		season: 2nd acquired:	'91-92, from montreal in expansion draft grade:		b+ after being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, more had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games. he, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously. he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman. #5	neil wilkinson		season: 4th acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		b- wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92. however, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing. he, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all. but he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force. #6	sandis ozolinsh		season: 1st acquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft grade:		i (a) at the time of his injury (december 30, against the philadelphia flyers), ozolinsh was well on track to be, imo, the team's mvp. a serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of ozolinsh's abilities. at the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called "rookie mistakes," but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran. if he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star. #19	doug zmolek		season: 1st acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		b zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two sharks to play in all 84 games of the season. he was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). he was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically. but to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents. =============================================================================== go calgary flames! al macinnis for norris! gary roberts for hart and smythe! go edmonton oilers! go for playoffs next year! stay in edmonton! =============================================================================== nelson lu (claudius@leland.stanford.edu) rec.sport.hockey contact for the san jose sharks

what are the leafs to do? i am a leaf supporter and i say the leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits pat burns. if you were pat burns what would you do? living in the bay area, i do not get enough leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag, (i would appreciate comments on the leaf/detroit 3rd line match-ups) but here is the basic idea... andreychuck and borchevsky have no business playing against the wings. they are too small. the key to any leafs success will have to be clark. he is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot. where the hell is anderson? anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin. put a little more bluntly, anderson has to be an asshole. he used to be good at it. we need him now. perhaps, perhaps the leafs can shut down detroit's second line. i was dissappointed to see shepard and yserbeart flying last night. these guys are the "swing" players for the wings. last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the wings. **this has to happen again**. clark-anderson-gilmour should be able to out hustle this line. anderson should do a nasty on yserbeart. clark should bang the hell out of sheppard. score gilmour score! suggestions: clarke-anderson-gilmour vs. sheppard-yserbeart-?? 	 andreychuck-borchevsy-?? vs. detroit checking line 	 toronto's checking line vs. yzerman-fedorov-probert (pray lots) * as suggested - i would bench andreychuck and borchevsky to stir things up 		 and through a monkey wrench into detroits game plan. however, 		if the detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their 		checking line against these "finesse" players - well then 		let them play. ** potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** van hellamond can not be faulted for the leafs demise either. ** the wings defense shut down the leafs (especially in the slot). i hope pat burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on monday night. this was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating. this calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next monday. -jake. go leafs !!!

i should have guessed. it's time for the annual pittsburgh penguins whine-a-thon. bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the devils in game 1. i'm sorry, mr. bowman, you're a great coach, but those "cheap shots" were nothing compared to what's going to come. also, i guess you were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white. it's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do. ps - nice dive on that high stick mario. everyone knew it was a high stick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent for later. just stirring it up a bit, ralph

here is a press release from the white house. remarks by president clinton to ncaa division i champion hockey team april 19; q&a following to: national desk contact: white house office of the press secretary, 202-456-2100 washington, april 19 -- following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine "black bears" ncaa division i hockey champions: the rose garden 9:58 a.m. edt the president: good morning ladies and gentlemen. it's an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears, the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house. i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship. and we're glad to have them here. i'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory. coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears. in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978. i'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today. you know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey. we don't have a lot of ice. (laughter.) but after spending three months getting banged around in this town, i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here. hockey is a tough game. it's a hard-hitting sport. it does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game. i wish we had that rule in the senate. (laughter.) in government as in hockey, leadership is important. in the united states senate, our team has a great captain, the majority leader and the senior senator from maine, george mitchell; junior senator -- cohen looks so young, i can't imagine. (laughter.) i'm actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me. on your hockey team, the captain jim montgomery has done a great job. he scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else i know a little bit about. sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities. i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind. i think it's important, as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives. we now have another role model, and i'm glad to have them here today. (applause.) (the president is presented with team jersey.) (applause.) the president: that's great. i love it. it's beautiful. (applause.) (the president is presented with an autographed stick.) the president: thank you. that's great. (applause.) * * * * * * q mr. president, did you authorize the move on waco this morning, sir? the president: i was aware of it. i think the attorney general made the decision. and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi. q did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed? the president: no, they made the tactical decisions. that was their judgment, the fbi. q is this a raid? the president: and i will -- i want to refer you to -- talk to the attorney general and the fbi. i knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions. q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning? q any chance for that stimulus package? the president: senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter. (laughter.) i was in there -- (laughter). senator mitchell: you have to pay that quarter. the president: i was ready. (laughter.) senator mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day. q any chance for your bill, sir? the president: we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week. we only had about five minutes to talk. and we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more. q senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise. the president: well, i know he did, but, look, senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when reagan and bush were president, in those administrations. and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work. i don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you can do it. you can look at the research there. so this position they're taking is not credible. we have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan. all these costs are covered during that time and then some. and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position. they've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work. so i think we've got a chance to work it out, and i'm hopeful. we'll see what happens today and tomorrow. i'm feeling pretty good about it. the press: thank you end 10:10 a.m. edt -30- -- canada remote systems - toronto, ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

how long can the leafs play short-handed and still be expected to score? they did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up. they spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're penalized again! sheesh -- like gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling every little push an shove in a game like that. and if you're going to, you have to do it for both teams. pearson (one of my four favorite leafs) played like a bonehead -- i saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty. cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of games ago and he played a good game. if the other players on his line can smarten up, that line should do okay. clark's got to get tough -- he's got to intimidate and go for the net. send clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board... and pearson... heck, maybe he should be benched. i hate to repeat grapes, but where the heck was foligno? zezel can't do all the checking himself -- and get macllwain on the move... we need some speed out there! keep potvin in net, he did okay considering... although (like i said a couple weeks ago) potvin messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year -- he can easily do it again. my prediction last week was toronto in 7 -- that the games det wins will be blow-outs and the game tor wins will be close -- i still stand by that. don't fret, leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to win 3! :-) burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines. match the wings line-per-line. he'll have his team checking hard, and he'll never let them get out-numbered in their own end. the leafs will win wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the first one). stephen leaf legge slegge@kean.ucs.mun.ca

early saturday morning and sunday afternoon. many people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies back from me. if your team name is not on this list, please resend your team to me and i'll see what i can do. any kind of "proof" you sent it on the weekend will help your case. :-) seriously, this is only a fun pool and i trust each person to be honest. again, sorry for any

to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota: from what i have seen in the local news (tv and newspaper), various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team. a columnist for the st. paul "pioneer press" wrote an article giving the "inside scoop" on the issue. there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin cities. first the sites: target center, civic center (st. paul), and yes, even the met center. the columnist was pretty confident that minnesota will get a team, and that the target center will ultimately win out. he argued, however, that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably. without the inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, i can't remember his name) believes that minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season. also, because of the situation with the timberwolves, things will be delayed until (unless) the city of minneapolis takes over the target center. however, they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed, because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at target). to add to this mess, a study (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the met center, which obviously delays the process even further. i hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging minneapolis to take over the target center sooner. the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met, which may happen. 	regarding possible candidates, the three teams are hartford, tampa bay, and new jersey. i would prefer the devils (minnesota " ice demons?") although the lightning may have potential. although it hasn't been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the target center next year. apparently the devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible, and i wouldn't be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either.	so, minnesota may end up getting another team, but it may take a few years. 	 	go sabres! 	 	robert andolina (former buffalonian living in minneapolis) 	randolin@polisci.umn.edu

i agree. it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game. (my roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (thanks for explaining the significance of that btw)) the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music. especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. other then that, hats off to espn. now if they'll only make a habit of this. yeah right! baseball seasons started (zzzzzz.....) =) koz lets go caps!!

this is a general question for us readers: how extensive is the playoff coverage down there? in canada, it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv (ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are wash-nyi and chi-stl, the latter because i'm in the wrong time zone!). we (in canada) are basically swamped with coverage, and i wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if the games go into double-ot. email me so as not to waste bandwidth, please. my news feed is kind of slow anyways. l8tr
game two of the detroit - toronto series will be a rougher game. i believe that clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars. i believe that probert will take exception to this and a fight between clark and probert will result. i know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but i know game two toronto will come out hitting. any takers on this issue?
hi all, due to living in the bay area, i as unable to see vancouver's victory over the jets last night. i know the score, but that rarely describes the game. could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened. how well did each team play? were the cannucks deserving of the victory? also, could some kind soul please email me the end of season, individual player stats? greg -- vancouver for the cup (in a virtual reality)--

by dave luecking of the post-dispatch staff at 9:11 thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer. their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 oakland avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound blues. the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit -- red wings 5, stars 3. with the north stars' loss, the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division. good thing, because the blues quit playing. they held a 5-1 lead over tampa bay when the detroit-minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. tampa's bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers, but officiating supervisor john d'amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired. ``i'm glad i didn't see it go in at the end," blues coach bob berry said. if the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berry's anger. ``it wasn't pretty at the end," he said. ``we played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. it slipped away at the end. it shouldn't have, but it did." still, the blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the blues still made the playoffs. they'll meet the chicago blackhawks in a best-of-seven norris division semifinal, beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium. the blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. tampa bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the blues 2-2 at tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points. the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room. instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment. ``it's a shame we let down," said kevin miller, one of three blues to score two goals. brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others. ``there was no need for a letdown. if we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy." instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``we won, and that's all that matters," said brett hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play." some players didn't have a problem. ``just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit," said rich sutter, who played with bassen and miller. ``we still had a game to play. you can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right. ``it was disappointing to see what was going on." bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues' effort. somehow, he missed the announcement of minnesota's loss. ``i didn't know it was final," he said. ``i was kind of looking around on the bench. i didn't realize it was a final for some reason. we're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end." the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesota-detroit score off of the board. the score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. the blues already led 4-0 at the time. ``i told them i didn't want to see the score, i didn't want to know the score," berry said. ``i felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took." if minnesota took a lead, berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the blues. if detroit led, he worried, the blues might quit. until the announcement, the blues played splendidly. shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. then, miller and bassen took charge late in the period. with the teams playing four on four, miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period. then, just 10.5 seconds later, bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone. bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of bret hedican's shot. the goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend. last year, bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on feb. 23. ``i was thinking of my buddy oliver," bassen said. ``he's in heaven now, and i know he was watching. i know he's happy." miller increased the blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by zombo at 11:09. then, steve maltais broke curtis joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1. less than a minute after the north stars' final was announced, tim bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. but shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from nelson emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the second period. then, it was all lightning. adam creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph. guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span

i've heard that you can score on belfour by shooting high because he goes down a lot, and on potvin by shooting high on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so deep in the net. any truth to these? 			brad a wings fan, but no predictions.

farewell, minnesota fans. get stuffed, dallas stars. as the north stars fade to black, i hope that minneapolis/st. paul are not long without an nhl team. it just seems "right" that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well. the loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the 1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while). i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in 1980. (i got it to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up.) what a glorious season that was for the north stars! dwarf -- w. jim jordan "i don't mean to tell you how to live dwarf@x400gate.bnr.ca (internet) your life--that's what the tv's for-- i work for bnr; i do not speak for it. but if i didn't believe in jesus, i'd be going to hell." - peter heath

detroit is a very disciplined team. there's a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast, so toronto would have to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last resort anyway. toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players. toronto is just an average team, detroit isn't ballard screwed toronto when he was owner. everyone knows that. and it's going to take time for toronto to become a real force. i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year. he can't pull the whole team forever. patrick walker university of new brunswick

1992-93 los angeles kings notes. -------------------------------- playoffs: --------- *stauber disturbed by third-man theme by rick sadowski, daily news barry melrose's decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender. "i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most fun time of the year, and i'm not," stauber said with some emotion monday. "i think i have worked hard enough for that." stauber said he accepts melrose's choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames. hrudey made 21 saves in sundays 6-3 opening victory. but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no. 3 man behind rick knickle. stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no. 1 job from hrudey. knickle? he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since march 29. yet, when the series resumes wednesday, knickle will serve as hrudey's backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn. "if i'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...i dropped too. 3. what happened to no. 2?" stauber wondered. "not that i'd be happy with no. 2, but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs." perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance, but melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure. while insisting he is the kings' "goalie of the future," melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season. they were, according to melrose: a 7-2 loss to san jose on dec. 26; an 8-3 loss to the new york rangers on jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with detroit on feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to vancouver on thursday. "four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey, and he didn't do it," melrose said. "an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him. the mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup." "i'm not blaming robb for the losses, but if you're going to be no. 1, you've got to be able to walk your talk. you've got to be able to play when everything is on the line. robb stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe i expect more from him than he does." ouch. that remark stung stauber. he began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster, then came on at the end. "i expect more from myself than anybody, including barry melrose," said stauber, a three-year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989, only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries. "what i've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can i go through? i obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise i wouldn't be here." "anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me. i'm not saying barry doesn't know me, but don't say i've been without expectations. if anything, i'm a perfectionist." stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned. "but even though i didn't play well, i get knocked down from maybe on to three? it's a bit of a jump," he said. "you're almost no. 1, or if you play a good game you're no. 1 and if you don't you're no. 3? why does jack nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75? can you explain that? that's what barry wanted me to explain to him, why i didn't come through when he counted on me. i don't know. what i do know is, it's a sport. i'll be there." melrose's "goalie of the future" statement doesn't mean much to stauber. "before you know it, i'll be 30 and there will be no future," he said. ------ *game 1 of the kings @ flames playoff series drew a 4.2 nielsen rating on abc channel 7 here in la. the kings averaged a 2.1 nielsen rating in the 10 regular season games aired on channel 5. around the nhl: --------------- *san jose fired coach george kingston, who lead the team to a 11-71-2 mark in their 2nd nhl season. kingston was 28-129-7 over the past 2 years with the sharks. ------ *former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers. bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager. *last nights games: ------------------- win 2 @ van 4 (van leads 1-0) tor 3 @ det 6 (det leads 1-0) =============================================================================== stan willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com) net contact: l.a. kings >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> talk with the l.a. kings mailing list ...... kings@cs.stanford.edu to subscribe or unsubscribe: ....... kings-request@cs.stanford.edu <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ===============================================================================

37 4*2min 6,500 rob hearn (usa) canada 10 13 6 - 29 6*2min bill ranford stopped 36 shots to lead canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well played game. the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding ranford. later on, kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom played very well too. stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up jan larsson but again ranford came up big. period ended scoreless but the edge to sweden in creating more opportunities. second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save. mark recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros, eric one timed the puck but soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. at the 7-minute mark, canada started applying pressure on the swedes. sanderson-dineen-brind'amour worked hard and kept the puck in the swedes' zone. dineen gave the puck to sanderson who skated around a screened swedish defenseman, came in on soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom's far post, 1-0 canada. the swedes picked up their game after that, and peter forsberg had a shot that hit ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out. then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play. jan larsson took a shot from the slot, ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by the far post, passed the puck and ranford was beat, 1-1. third period started as the other periods, swedes having most of the pressure but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal. at 5:54, canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it. that resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in the goal crease. geoff sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he explained afterwards), and he put it low on soderstrom's stick side, close to the post. excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal. canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it 3-1. the swedes ran out of gas then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods. the 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, rod brind'amour scoring on a rebound from soderstrom, where the swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room. a very good game (the best in the wc so far?), with both goalies playing great. soderstrom best player in sweden, but ranford even played better than soderstrom, that tells you something about ranford. probably the best goalie in the world, were some comments after the game. canada played a very disciplined defense, ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense. lindros played a lot and played well, sanderson naturally game hero with two goals. the forsberg-naslund-bergqvist line sweden's best along with larsson-juhlin- nilsson. swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg peter popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg eric lindros, and managed this very well. ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc, and considering that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game, he played very well. swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because of the swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake on the 1-3 goal. lines information follows further below. -

	relying on canadian tourists and transplanted northeasterners to support a team in miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving cities without a team such as san diego & milwaukee. i wish the panthers or whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to hispanics, they're in deep doo-doo. already, there are rumors that tampa may move to milwaukee.
	i loved the abc coverage. the production was excellent. the appearance was excellent. it had a sleek modern look. this was the first time i heard thorne & clement & i thought they were great. my only request is to leave al micheals out of this. he annoys me. 	i'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. my guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb.-april and then the playoffs. i envy you canadians with your tsn & cbc. maybe i'll get a dish to pick up canadian tv. how much are those things, btw?

	on tuesday, when it was raining in chicago, espn provided bonus hockey coverage. now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the ny-wash ot was replaced with the angels-?? game. people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the u.s the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they can't skip the baseball game. why don't you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get. geoff filinuk
quebec dominated habs for first 2 periods and only roy kept this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal. canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump & pull back most of the time. hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 & could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. canadians are dead meat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. tee it up jacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st place, welcome to the adams division. dennis

'nuff said. and did somebody say dale hunter was a playoff choker? i'd rethink that position :-)
come on boston, where the hell are you? seven wins in a row and what, choke? i'd much rather see the bruins in the wales conference finals vs. pitt than buffalo or quebec, if only because it would be more interesting. not that buffalo or quebec can't put up a good fight, but i'd much more enjoy a 7-0 pasteing of the bruins than the devils. you have to feel for terrerri(sp?). ah, well, maybe the devils will pull it out, or maybe the pens will lose in the second round, but if not, i hope the bruins are there to meet them.

while watching the penguins/devils game last night, i saw the "slash" that barrasso took on the neck. this brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre, but i'm not positive. does anyone remember/know his name? what has happened to him since? what about the player whose skate cut the goalie? name? info? has this ever happened before in a hockey game? thanks, carol go pens!

just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in buffalo. i still don't understand why buffalo, but maybe it's lucky. :-) btw, they shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice. although blue did give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his stick. -- valerie hammerl 	 john sr. would lift pat over the boards, grab hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu his hand, and start running around the outside, v085pwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu faster and faster.

i don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey game, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying "sorry we can't show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not even a game. a friggin highlight show). gee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime. i live in pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot of coverage. i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in texas must feel.

tom barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season. he unveiled it at a game in boston. it was all black, with pgh city scenes on it. the "golden triangle" (pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena (i think) on the other. on the back of the helmet was the old pens' logo (the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) pens logo, and a space for the "new" (now current) logo. tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it for him. but while wearing the mask, the pens got thumped by the bruins. the very next game, tommy was back to the old paint job. a great mask done in by a goalie's superstition. lori

(by the way, don't get me wrong -- i like jagr. he may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). -- roland dreier dreier@math.berkeley.edu

after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that milwaukee should have an nhl team, i thought i'd pass along a story i heard recently. this is second hand, so i don't know how true it is, but i have no reason to doubt it either. bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge hockey team. the owner of the admirals (sorry, i can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the bradley center. supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise, but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high. like i said, i don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if it's true, don't look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon. the admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an nhl club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the nba's milwaukee bucks play there as well. charlie betz cray research, inc. chippewa falls, wi cbetz@romulus.cray.com

it was unlikely, improbable. for the bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the sabres, it was a taste of heaven. for the first time since 1983, the sabres have won the first three games of a series. last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the canadiens. it takes a little more work this time. the sabres seem ready to put in the extra work. on the heels of a shutout, one that took away boston's home ice advantage, the sabres came back with a four to three overtime win. it wasn't easy. it wasn't always pretty. it still worked. john blue got the nod for boston, supplanting andy moog as starting goaltender. moog was pulled midway through game 2 on tuesday. buffalo started with a goal by mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with boston's don sweeney and gord roberts in the box. lafontaine and hawerchuk had the assists. goal number two was khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting khmylev. smehlik and hannan assisted. determined not to be shut out, boston tallied on a shot by ray bourque on the powerplay, with colin patterson and bob sweeney both in the box. period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs. the third saw boston's smolinski get his first, courtesy of oates. buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former bruin bob sweeney (khmylev and carney). neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. last year overtime meant a bruin win. last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as buffalo scored with ray bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by khmylev (hawerchuk and lafontaine) a minute into overtime. both teams finished with 34 shots. power-play conversions--boston 5-1. buffalo 7-2. referee--rob shick. comments: shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing. buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again. mogilny was checking. granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to mogilny. the crowd was unbelievable. i don't think i've ever heard a crowd that loud in the aud for a sabres game (remember, i was only five when they played for the cup. i don't remember it and no one took me to the games). doug bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting. it didn't seem to matter, as most of the sabres and even muckler said it was great. yuri khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called. sweeney (2) and fuhr (1) each were out before yuri made his appearance, sans jersey. when asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but i digress). the interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak english, he must not understand playoffs. uh-huh. -- valerie hammerl 	 john sr. would lift pat over the boards, grab hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu his hand, and start running around the outside, v085pwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu faster and faster.

during the first three games of the pens-devils series, i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens. jagr, maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch. but, one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman. despite brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the devils' line changing adantage in last night's game, bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark. granted, the hell-dwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night, but bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done. his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible. bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis. last night, for instance, he realized that the speed of jagr, straka, and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance. as a result, straka received many more shifts than average; jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and maceachern scored a goal, while complementing jagr many times throughout the night. his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about success. while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson, bowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly seen, mark in pittsburgh.
i really feel the need for a knowledgable hockey observer to explain this year's playoffs to me. i mean, the obviously superior toronto team with the best center and the best goalie in the league keeps losing. what gives? -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i stand by all the misstatements that i've made. 		-- vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson, 8/17/89 me too -- nick duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>

the isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci. the isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like flatley, doesn't work against the caps. i hope al realizes this!! they have too many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? if last night's game is any omen, the isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; coming from behind late in a game. my advice to the caps is to pounce on those healy rebounds. flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of dale hunter. ray ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an italian from the past; john tonelli!!! it was tonelli who won a similar game against the pens in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. the isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into ot tied at 3. in ot, tonelli scored the game winner to send the isles to the next round. the isles have lacked this tenacity for years, but perhaps its back! it was good to see the coliseum packed just like the ole days!!! good luck to the isles the rest of the way!!!!! john scialdone scialdone@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov """and the home of the brave""" jerry garcia, bob weir, vince welnick april 12, 1993: opening day, candlestick park

(and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good). the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans. the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team. then, even his coaching began to degrade. >so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm. >quinn is one example of a better gm than murray. there are a number of reasons why detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc. was when quinn took over, some of which i outlined above, but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn, with the exception of yzerman. and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender, as i'm sure everyone reading this will agree. we'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out, like last year). >gregmeister --randy

the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules. overtime time games that are not shown? what the hell kind of shit is this? if that would have happened to the flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin with) while i was watching, i would have gone throught the roof! however, everybody is getting pissed off at espn, but they are not the ones to blame. they have prior contracts that they just can't simply break whenever they want to. the n.h.l. is to blame. when they signed the deal with espn, they had to know of this. they had to know shit like this would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority. the n.h.l. should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn. how can the n.h.l. do this to its fans? how dare they. we are the ones that make the damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to watch! they more i write about this, the more pissed off i get. we must let the n.h.l. know that we expect a little better than this. if anybody out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know. well i had to get that off my chest and while i'm at it.... mario is the michael jordan of hockey. all that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2. last night in the 3rd game between nj and pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off. the guy on him was doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall to the ice. then the fucking ref(van helloamend?) called the guy for holding. they replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about hockey) wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the nj player had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him. it is simple, mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2. but the thing that really pissed me off is, pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, i don't remember, on the resulting pp and eventually won 4-3. his diving/calls makes a huge difference in the outcome of a game. they gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious. that is not hockey. it allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. this has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat. however, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got any. all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed. steve

bleep! bleep! bleep! the bruins lost again in o.t. i can't stand it! aside from frustrated ravings, i must give buffalo credit: they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense. boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasions. the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds. fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help. boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game. as a result, boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down. this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the bruin's advancement to the second round are quite bleak). imho, the bruins need to score first. if they can do that, they have an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods. (the scary thing is that i'll be going to grad school in buffalo next year. i'll never cheer for the sabres... you can't convert me... ^:) mtm3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- mike mosscrop -- die hard bruins fan dept. of chemistry umass-lowell mosscropm@woods.ulowell.edu

wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, boston. which sweeney you ask...well, of course bob sweeney, the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing). game winner in ot in game 1, and another big goal (seconds after fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why grant has 5 rings!!!) to put buffalo ahead in the 3rd. yes, neely countered a minute later, but hadn't this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, i think boston would have notched their first win of the series. well, the sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but i certainly feel they've got boston right were they want them...actually, they've got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about. one more astronomical game by fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and i think borque, neely, jouneau (sp?), and company are gonna be swinging a new stick (weather is perfect for golf season) real soon. i'm not gonna waiger anything on this, because i've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey. talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one? the whole ot (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season). the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds. i don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was blatent. finally, the sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when lafontaine scooped at the puck 3 times. when hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up. i didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, "they score, they score!!!". the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on. doug mckee mckee@cs.buffalo.edu

(excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the change.) with the immense talent on the penguins roster this year, a tougher bowman keeps the egos in check. johnson on the other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players to new heights. both coaches have / had different strengths. both of which came at exactly the right time. another person also mentioned that bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. how can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also keeps the egos in check. just a couple of ideas. -- _____________________________________________________________________________ tom huot 			 huot@cray.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

according to the hockey gurus over at espn, should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record, but the devils will be playing the penguins. this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils. i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include: 1. season series 2. goals against 3. goals for in this order (correct me if i'm wrong). anyone have anything to add? craig go islanders!

i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton. oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week. while the exact details are not known, it is believed to concern the oiler's future. rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton. during the press conference, pocklington may announce the deal. it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium. northlands has offered to buy the oilers for $65 million earlier, but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington. as for me, my opinion is divided... edmonton has been fairly supportive of the oilers. even though they're a small market team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. even with the problems that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did. on the other hand, if the team does move, there is no place more deserving than hamilton. of course, how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of bettman?

i watched the game germany-czechs in wc today...and i was astonished about the behaviour of the german audience! the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy! they threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is that stupid or what?? i guess the canadian referee (one of the isostar-bros ;) gave the german team a penalty for that, but it didn't help much. i guess the germans just are proud over their nazi-kill-'em-all-everyone- but-us-germans-sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport (remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer) it really pisses me off! i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks, but most of them seem to do... 	jokke kylmaoja 	golf@phoenix.oulu.fi
i have some advice for you, and some thoughts about your hatred of the minnesota north stars: 1. a real team like toronto would not be moved, you are right, just eliminated from the playoffs first round! 2. why stay in minnesota when you can go to a college in western ontario and actually take classes on map-reading and the artistry of bsing specifically set up for just you. 3. why should anyone love the stars, when hating the leafs is so much better? 4. oh, i'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my big words.. next time i'll limit my vocabulary to words like "get real team now" and "do not waste our time" 5. respond to this article. i love to laugh at your humor, even though it it unintentional. i got a big kick out of go leafs go.... go where? home, i think!! :) -- delarocq@eos.ncsu.edu --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988,1989,1990,1991 afc east division champions 1991,1992, and 1993 afc conference champions!!!!!!!! :) squished the fish ............... monday night football, november 16, 1992.. squished the trash talking fish.. afc championship, january 17, 1992.. if you are a buffalo bills fan, email me at delarocq@eos.ncsu.edu so we can talk all about the games, insight, etc. if you are a packers fan, let me know. i am interested in any news out of green bay...

as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and doesn't know anything about him, i don't know whether it is just this area (pittsburgh) of the usa that is "deprived" of his broadcasts or whether he's a canadian thing altogether. seriously, what is he all about? i know he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him, someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question is, what is the deal with him? secondly, are the comments of his that i read about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him seriously? i gotta tell you, from what i see, he really sounds like an ass. let me know - maybe i'm missing something.

it was great to hear that umass is bringing back hockey! it reminded me that a couple of years ago there was talk that both bimidgi (sp?) and mankato state trying to upgrade their programs to div. 1 status. i also seem to remember that they had some trouble with new ncaa rule about just who was allowed to compete at the div. 1 level. was that ever resolved? also, i was just wondering if there is any college hockey east of colorado (alaska excepted). with the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, i would expect there to be some interest building at the collegiate levels too. anyone heard anything? james old, e-mail jold@vma.cc.nd.edu

i knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still too much hockey for atlanta. atlanta's abc has declined to pick up any playoff games till may9. and even when they show the games on may9 and may16, they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. i know this is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia, alabama, etc., but it is still pretty annoying. at least in pittsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate. i asked them what their problem was. i told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time without much promotion. besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs. she told me that they had contractual obligations. i asked her if golf was shown oin abc, would contractual obligations come in the way. and how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? she then couldn't give me a coherent answer. also, i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good. i think abc and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with thier sports programming. i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb 2 and complain bitterlyt about this. tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation. the lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. sometimes, the reason is low ratings. then another time, she says contractual obligations.

ok. i know i look pretty desperate on this bboard. i think i have posted 3 or 4 messages already on the issue of nhl telecats over the last few weeks. but, hey. i am pretty desperate. what i am interested is not just a sportsbar with multiple screens so thast i can watch the game on one of those silent screens. are there any hockey oriented bars in this area. or does some patrick division or adams division fan have a satellite dish? i don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.

(during important games listen to the pre-game interview will bowman and compare that to what is on the ice!) i agree bowman is a master of the lineups. remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free in ot. when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach! i am left asking "what is a modern coach if not bowman?" -jake.

the goalie to whom you refer is clint malarchuk. he was at that time playing with the sabres. his team immediately prior to that was the washington capitals. while he did recover and continue to play, i do not know his present whereabouts.
just some thoughts: i don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player, but this time i couldn't resist. during the pens-devils game last night, second period, i think kevin stevens was in the penalty box, nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face, then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself! all kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh! and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen, ulf is getting a little out of hand lately. his cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent. as everybody in the meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the devil's throat. i've always supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating," but he's starting to push it over the edge imho. of course, holik's chop to barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. it seems that he was following the "the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them" philosophy. as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day, jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night, and last night as well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the devils end was pretty exciting. matt at uva

all these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at njd, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and excellent forwards and defensemen. shooter in richer, an all around do it all in todd, chef stasny-master of a thousand dishes, power play captain-stevens. take a look at the numbers, or play with them and see for yourselves.
way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the stanley cup. soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the joe louis arena, that is) started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win. after each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice. (they are dead by the way.) it was a brilliant marketing strategy to shore up the demand for one of their least popular products. hope this helps. j. lange

can the sabres win two more games against the bruins? i think game three in buffalo will be the most important of the series. if the sabres lose that game, the party will be over. it will be hello next year. the key for the remaining games in the series will be whether fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if mogilny can continue skate by the bruins. he has shown demonstrated excellent speed. finally, the sabres appear to have shown up for the post season. sabres/bills fan
if i were pat burns i'd throw in the towel. the wings dominated every aspect of the game. trying to mix up the lines is a dead end. murray has too many combinations to counter with. my prediction is wings in 5. mark let's go wings!!!
buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with boston, and the reason....grant fuhr ? fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him money goaltender. fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the league anymore (statistically at least), but he's proving that he can make the big save at the right time. the leafs should have kept fuhr, and probably would have had a chance against powerhouse detroit. but again.......where was andreychoke in game 1 ? i can see the huge smile on gerald's face after fuhr's performance. %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* * __ ______________ ____________________________________ % % \ \_)____________/ a l l e z l e s b l u e s ! ! ! * * \ __________/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ % % \ ________/ * * \ _______/ joe ashkar % % \ \ contact for the blues * * \ \ saint louis jca2@cec1.wustl.edu % % (___) blues * *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

hooray, i hear on tsn that the jets have won a game, selanne getting a hat-trick! of course, here in god's country (read ontario!) i couldn't see that game, nor any other in the van-wpg series so far, because our beloved cbc figures no one out here cares about this series (which has looked pretty competitve so far... on monday and wednesday nights, cbc could have shown the toronto- detroit game, done the news, then picked up winnipeg-vancouver. they didn't. tonight? you guessed it, toronto-detroit, the news (not the end of the jets game), then calgary-la. so, if it's "hockey night in canada", why can't this ontarian see one of the two series with two canadian teams? is this too much to ask? paul badertscher 35002_2765@uwovax.uwo.ca
teemu selanne had 3 goals, keith tkachuk had one, and luciano borsato scored a rare jets shorthanded goal as the jets held on to beat the canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1. trevor linden and pavel bure had two goals each for the canucks in a losing cause. selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from darrin shannon. hard work paid off tonight for the jets, and if the jets continue to exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it.

is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad?? i can't remember how many times during the penguins-devils game they showed some guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal. in fact, i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner. now the last time i watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . . is it just me??	 greg

i have been to all 3 isles/caps tilts at the crap centre this year, all isles wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles. vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! he couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! al must remember a few years back when mick scored 3 goals in one period against the caps in a 5-3 isles win. i was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. wake-up al!!! years later he's gotten worse. he's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. i think he would make a good police officier!!! as for pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. he either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. he can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. he either falls down or committs a penalty. call up somebody from capital district al!!!!! as far as the playoffs, the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps. two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. they should meet in the first round. the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against jersey tonite. it'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the isles. i wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. al must understand he can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 isles. maybe al should got to. where is bobby nystrom?? clark gilles?? john tonelli?? these are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench!! fire al!!!! john scialdone scialdone@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov **********when your ship comes in, first man takes the sail********************

you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan. anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the nhl. there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. bobby clarke, kenny linsemen, pie mckenzie, chris chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf. violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (should have been a women) samuelson don't belong. when players like ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. a christian pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet neely will have his day. the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a stanely cup. this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup, the penguins would not even notice he's gone. he's an eyesore on the game of hockey. rich

4/23/93 blues shutout hawks again, lead series 3-0 ----------------------------------------------------- it was a great atmosphere last night at the st. louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game. people were cheering the blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the entire game. my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players. here's a game summary from the st. louis post-disptach. enjoy... by dave luecking of the post-dispatch staff: at 10:24 p.m. friday night, the arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph. the fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``only god saves more than joseph." it was a fitting tribute to joseph, who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep. joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday, blanking the blackhawks 3-0 in game 3 of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. the blackhawks haven't scored against joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of game 1. joseph has shut out the blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds, a blues record. jacques plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the philadelphia flyers, one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history. the blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in game 4, a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday. the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals. the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game 2 when joseph had to make 47 saves. this time, the blues held the shots down to 34, and the blackhawks couldn't touch joseph. well, they touched joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game. but joseph and the blues were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way. the blues' grinders -- bob bassen, rich sutter, kevin miller and dave lowry -- wore down the blackhawks, taking the visitors from chicago off their game. the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and scorers, who made the most of their opportunities. craig janney, brett hull and nelson emerson scored, getting one goal in each period. hull assisted on janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties. checker miller set up hull's goal in the second period, and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final period. blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling ``sweep. sweep. sweep." they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour ``bell-four. bell-four." they also chanted ``na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye." such talk is a tad premature. there's still one game left, but the blues are on a roll. they have the blackhawks on their heels. the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. rich sutter leveled bryan marchment, and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice. chicago tried to retaliate, but troy murray's decision to run into joseph backfired. referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty. the blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer. joseph stopped larmer's shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period. the 'hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where joseph's butterfly style is deadly. rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but chicago got only two shots on goal, as many as miller. the blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour. marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up. he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedican's third penalty. he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at 14:58, and gave the blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan. the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. hull's shot hit belfour's right shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. belfour dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to janney, who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs. the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the blackhawks lost their composure. joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period, and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues' bench. chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice, and marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. chicago survived the blues' power play, but the loss of chelios hurt. he didn't return until the midway point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, hull had increased the blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in miller's crisp pass. try as they might, the blackhawks couldn't get to joseph, who stopped everything they could throw at him. he stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. chicago also hit the goalpost twice. emerson's goal put the game away. he went hard to the net and redirected felsner's pass. %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* *

the flyers blew a 3-0 lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period, but kevin dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win, 7-4 over the sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. tommy soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night. roster move: andre faust was once again recalled from hershey, shawn cronin was a healthy scratch. lines: eklund-lindros-recchi beranek-brind'amour-dineen lomakin-butsayev-conroy faust-acton-brown galley-bowen yushkevich-hawgood carkner-mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary: say, if anybody from buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? we had to turn down the volume! the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there... mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric 1/2 way up on his left. eric dropped it to galley, and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone. mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik, skated around him and in on fuhr. smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a 1-0 flyers lead at 0:18. it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists :-). the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage. the game then became a defensive struggle for a while. the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone. lafontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the flyers smothered the sabres power play. mogilny got a post after it was over. the 25th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers. keith carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play. the best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the flyers a shot on goal, although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot. towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. greg hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. shots were 8-6 buffalo after the flyers had led 6-2 at one point. mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods. jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. this was considered a rebuilding year after *the trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. when asked if he agonized over *the trade* he said that it was russ farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money. but yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's russ' call, and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. he feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the cup. he expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer. he's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it "outstanding"). happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus. the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. the flyers had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards. eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. he half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15. then mogilny on a breakaway. he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom. he went with the backhander, but soderstrom was all over it. the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. the sabres coudln't get started. ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. it started out a 1 on 1, but brind'amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 flyers at 5:40. that was all for fuhr, john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over. but the sabres still had lots of power play time. again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone, and when they finally did the flyers were all over them. boos began to ring through the building. but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal. smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot. hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it. mistake #1, he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a) the rebound or b) barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. well, the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom, and mistake #2, galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. he didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. with the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the flyers. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills. lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, i think it was barnaby again. this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended. things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. the gloves were dropped, and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him. but during the fight, he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the sabres at 14:15, barnaby only got 5. the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. after a couple of good sabre chances, audette handed to ledyard at the point, and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom. lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to randy wood at the right. soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine, and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the flyers lead to 3-2. lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break. the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone, but hasek was strong. finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line. another mini-breakaway for mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles... that was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 sabres. into the 3rd period, and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back. a 2 on 1, acton with the puck, he dropped to eklund in the slot, and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. when he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. that was still during the carryover power play time. than an incredible almost goal. randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom. soderstrom goes down, wood pokes the puck under soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. but up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net... dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. the flyers could not get anything going at all. they finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. as time ran out, beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle. eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at hasek, and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 flyers. but the sabres came right back. lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net. erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4. then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. the flyers set up in the sabres zone, and stayed there. off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle. while brind'amour wrestled for the puck, dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek's glove side at 6:44. play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone. brind'amour and ledyard went after it, and rod got the puck. he backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a 6-4 flyers lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season. then carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the sabres power play. not much action on the 4 on 4, and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play. play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. the sabres weren't able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the sabres. finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind'amour stripped it away from him. he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle, and dineen found acton at the right of hasek. he slid the puck between two sabres defenders, and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. that was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game. so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. kevin dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but i don't think so). the flyers longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. eric lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the rangers lose the tie breaker. a couple misc notes: forget the mike keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year. in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award, but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman. the times of trenton has reported that "a preeminent specialist from oklahoma" has looked over tommy soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future. same paper had a blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. his response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if farwell didn't want him back. flyers team record watch: eric lindros: 41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points (rookie records) club record goals:			club record points: eric lindros	40

#21	peter ahola		season: 2nd acquired:	'92-93, trade with pittsburgh for future considerations grade:		i (b) it is way too early to tell about ahola, who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft. ahola had only played 50 games this season (i think it's actually less; the san jose mercury news may be in err here), 20 of them with the sharks. in the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... peter ahola. #24	doug wilson		season: 16th acquired:	'91-92, trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and 		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft grade:		i (b) i have often been accused of overly down on wilson; i may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games). but next year, which may be wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor. #29	dean kolstad		season:	2nd acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		i (c-/d+) it's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl. in those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways. he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team. #38	pat macleod		season: 2nd acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		i (?) macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad, because the sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with kansas city, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a "rehab assignment" that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs. since he has played so little, i can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills. #41	tom pederson		season: 1st acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		i (b+) called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net, including yours truly. he demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games. however, his size (5' 9", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. but to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league. #45	claudio scremin		season: 1st acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade:		i (d+/d) he played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of kolstad, scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time. he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks. the only notable thing that will go down in scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre. =============================================================================== go calgary flames! al macinnis for norris! gary roberts for hart and smythe! go edmonton oilers! go for playoffs next year! stay in edmonton! =============================================================================== nelson lu (claudius@leland.stanford.edu) rec.sport.hockey contact for the san jose sharks

"they're real and they're spectacular", the blues shutout the blackhawks in consecutive playoff games. if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday, i will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. "not that there's anything wrong with that." curtis joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". not even "superman" could play any better in goal. joseph must have been eating his "cereal." "it's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the arena. it was "very refreshing" to see the blues "double-dip" the hawks. the hawks goons tried to "pick" on hull, janney, and joseph but the blues checking line "nipped" those hawks real well. the fat "yoyoma" will sing on sunday, and the hawks will head to the "beach". the hawks' trip back to chicago will feel like a long "journey from milan to minsk" enjoy sunday's game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple. just a little fun. %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* * __ ______________ ____________________________________ % % \ \_)____________/ a l l e z l e s b l u e s ! ! ! * * \ __________/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ % % \ ________/ * * \ _______/ joe ashkar % % \ \ contact for the blues * * \ \ saint louis jca2@cec1.wustl.edu % % (___) blues * *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

it's about time the boys got it together!! they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games. but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3. except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the wings. please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true! i have to admit that goaltending was the key. potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the leafs went through in the 2nd. he also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost cheveldae 2 goals. clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!), although i still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2. if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, but a chance....i'm no rm.....where is he anyways? haha). barfly
apparently, the public workers' strike in st john's, newfoundland is over. the strike has, since mid-january, forced the st john's maple leafs hockey team to play their home games in other cities such as toronto, cornwall and charlottetown. they have been playing their playoff home games in halifax, nova scotia. leafs' management said that they could return to st john's for the second round. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + bri farenell			farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu + + ahl, ecac and boston bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey		 + + adirondack red wings, calder cup champs: '81 '86 '89 '92	 + + clarkson hockey, ecac tournament champs: '66 '91 '93		 + + glens falls high hockey, ny division ii state champs: '90 '91 + + ahl fans: join the ahl mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed in between periods on a tv game. that they usually get a goal or an assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk to stars more than regular players which explains the hight percentage of results after. just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont care about this trivial nonsense. ttyl tom -- tom moffat victoria b.c. canada
buffalo fans: some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator al" on espn, believe that game 3 is critical for the sabres. helloooo!!!!! the sabres are ahead 2 games to 0, not behind. as a life-long sabres fan, i am well aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that. as long as the sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 or game 4), they are still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at buffalo. if they lose games three and four, then start worrying. game 3 is critical for boston, not buffalo. rob andolina randolin@polisci.umn.edu

well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are good in general: 1. the 2 teams that i hate most: chicago and "basten" are down 3 zip. (even though there is a possibility either can still win their series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the underdogs (st. louis and buffalo) is so rewarding). 2. montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some (really) good draft picks... :-( 3. is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the wales? 4. is it just because they're playing montreal that i find the diques arrogant ***'s, or are they really? 5. smythe-what???? i'm really getting sick of seeing douggie and wendel night in and night out... we should see some canucks/jets/flames action...! 6. don cherry is an ******* alright, but hey... so are our politicians... obleafsjoke: q. what do you get when you cross a maple leaf and a groundhog? a. six more weeks of crummy hockey! ------------------------------------------------------------------ l8r, dudes... go habs gooooooooooooooooooo! -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- jon shaib ac291@carleton.freenet.ca ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

here we are with the sabres up 2-0 to the bruins and the sabres' farm team, the rochester amerks, on their way to the calder cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? the same penguins/devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. what's worse, the sportschannel coverage of the islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got cba basketball last night, if you can believe it. i assume the sabres are demanding the sc blackout, not espn, since we are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the islanders territory (msg coverage of the rangers is blacked out here). this despite being a solid seven hours plus from long island. does anyone know what grc is doing, besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13? did empire demand a fortune for the games? what about the games on fox37 (or whatever number it is there in buffalo)? has anyone phoned to complain (besides me)? george -- george ferguson arpa: ferguson@cs.rochester.edu dept. of computer science uucp: rutgers!rochester!ferguson university of rochester vox: (716) 275-2527 rochester ny 14627-0226 fax: (716) 461-2018

here's a summary of don cherry's coach's corner from april 21, 1993. the game being broadcast in my region was la and calgary, although i think it was filmed during the toronto-detroit game that night. (warning... anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) topics ------ don's tie, grant fuhr, penalties, wings vs leafs, fighting, dale hunter. episode summary --------------- this episode began with the camera zoomed in on don's tie. don was pointing out the characters on the tie... bugs bunny, foghorn leghorn, and yosemite sam (who don called lanny macdonald.) ron maclean began by mentioning that don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of hunter and fuhr. don began to praise fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and said that he's winning the series against boston all by himself. he then showed clips from earlier episodes (nov. 14, jan. 16) when fuhr was still with the leafs, and don advised "don't trade fuhr!" don went on to predict that if buffalo gets by boston, it would be fuhr who wins the series. muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but don feels muckler's been vindicated. the next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. he showed a clip from a winnipeg-vancouver game, where domi hit a vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with domi hitting the vancouver player with his shoulder. don: "its sad what they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed." next, they went to the playoff series between detroit and toronto. people in detroit were calling wendel clarke "wendy" for not fighting. however, don pointed out that probert was not fighting either. this lead don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: "it's like college hockey... the little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. that's why you're seeing so much stickwork. because they know you won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. the rules are made by people who don't know what's going on in hockey". the final topic don discussed was dale hunter. don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of hunter from a previous game. when he was younger, hunter was taught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of just letting kids have fun. at then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that don sounded like one of the chipmunks. rating ------ typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some good quotes. i'd give it a 7.0 out of 10. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \ \ |allan sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca) \ \ |department of computing science, \ \_______ |university of alberta, edmonton, alberta, canada. \ ### \ _ |--------------------------------------------------- \___###___\ (_) |my opinions are mine and mine alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "it is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit..." - u. of a. golden bears hockey motto (c. drake) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
here's a summary of don cherry's coach's corner from april 23, 1993. it was taken from a tape delay of a vancouver-winnipeg game, but it was filmed during the toronto-detroit game that night. i think it was also shown during the calgary-la game. (warning... anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) topics ------ don's tie, doug gilmour, wings/leafs, quebec/montreal, boston/buffalo, wendel clark, fighting and stickwork. episode summary --------------- once again, the episode started with a shot of don's tie... this was a different tie than last time. don pointed out some of the characters on the tie, but gave them different names... felix the cat (sylverster), maclean (daffy duck), etc. ron maclean asked don what he thought of the current wings-leafs game. don thought it was good. burns told the leaf players "they won in their building, we're going to win in ours". don then began to praise gilmour again. don pointed out that gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against st. louis. (don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to gilmour, which was partly responsible for his good play.) several clips were then shown of gilmour from the series... a hit on constantinov, and a pass to andrewchuk resulting in a goal. on the game itself, the wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period. the wings have enough talent to score short handed however, and when the leafs get a power play, coach burns tells the leaf players "don't let them score on you". ron brought up the previous quebec-montreal game. [note: montreal won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] don thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of instant replay. on the buffalo-boston series [note: buffalo is currently winning the series 3-0], don gave full credit to goaltender grant fuhr. fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his play. wendel clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the detroit-toronto series. don defended him, by saying that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's new rules. "this used to be a rough and tough league... now its all hack and slash." don lays the blame on gil stien for the problems. don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by wings gm and coach bryan murray. a clip from a news conference by murray was shown, in which murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork. don also read a newspaper article in which murray makes the following statements: "players don't fight because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other. is this what the fans want to see? i guarantee there wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game." don warned league commisioner gary bettman to "smarten up" with fighting in hockey. he went on to say that before, there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. now, with no fights, someone gets cut every period. rating ------ typical anti-fighting posturing, but here don's opinion is supported by murray. i'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

do the isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides pilon??? once again, last night's stupid penalty put the isles in a hole for the remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! even though the isles nearly survived pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time for a 5-minute major penalty. instead of confronting cote as he came across the blueline, pilon backed up and swiped at cote's nose with his stick. al arbour can't be serious to think pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on the line??? i heard scott lachance is out till later in the series, but there must be someone else!!! bring back the bammer, dave langevin!!!! *******************************lets go islanders******************************** john scialdone scialdone@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov """i've been gambling hereabouts, for 10 good solid years""" jg/rh

yahooooooooo! the habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for quebec city to play game 5. btw, final score was habs 3-nords 2. the score might be a bit misleading. the habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on. the score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a ron hextall (bastard!). he's the reason the score was as close. habs winning goal was scored by benoit brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd. roy had an ok game. he made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds. this just in, espn radio reports that the bruins lost 6-5 in ot. yahooooooooooo!!! those suckers got what they deserved. life is just great!!!! now if my finals would go just as well! nick (i'll take off my town crier hat now) --- the czar of mainframe computing <bgk2@musicb.mcgill.ca> mcgill university

it's over - the sabres came back to beat the bruins in ot 6-5 tonight to sweep the series. a beautiful goal by brad may (lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice) ended it. fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem. montreal edged quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be headed for game 7. the habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. however, an early goal by brunet in the 3rd won it. the islanders won their 3rd ot game of the series on a goal by ray ferraro 4-3; the caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd. the isles' all-time playoff ot record is now 28-7. - vlad the impaler
like many others i too was watching the caps/isles game when the went to the baseball game. i too was pissed. how could they interupt such an important game. i understand about contracts, but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games! anyway, us blues (and hawks) fans got shafted worse! while everyone in the u.s. and watched the game on abc. however those of us who live in the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus(?) telethon. the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through hawk vision. this game, had it been televised, would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area since 1980. this television bull*&%$ has got to stop. we are not only being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but we are also being deprived of watching them on tv. peace, hammer
being a a blues fan i don't get to see much else from around the league with the exception of hockey night on espn. i can't get the blues games where i go to school, thus i don't get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the hawks. but last night i got to catch a glimpse of the caps/isles game. it occurred to me that turgeon is a stud on skates. his moves are quick and brilliant. you ny fans should be proud. p.s. who won the game (caps/isles)? peace, hammer
bufflo sabres has just finished their great four wins over boston. all sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players including mogily, fuhr, kemhlev and lafontin impressed me most. their skills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the coach's corner. go ! make hocky popular, make hocky more exciting but less violent !

add boston's weei-590am as the bruins' flagship station. you probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of boston since it's only a 5,000 watt station. the bruins also have network stations in all 6 new england states. this could be the bruins' last year on 'eei which also happens to be an all-sports radio station. the problem is that the bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station(wmex 1150am) whenever there is a the same-night conflict with the nba's boston celtics. this happened 28 times during the course of the regular season.(the celtics own financially troubled weei). the bruins might resurface on whdh 850 next year. stay tuned. -ppv mark

disaster! finland was beaten by czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2). finland will be 4th of pool b and will most certainly meet canada in the quarter final on wednesday 28th. lack of scoring skills has been the major problem of team finland throughout the tournament. briza (goalie) was the mvp of the czech team and tikkanen was the mvp of the finnish team. jarkko #14

(in the fifth, the finnish goalie, ketterer was elected the best finn) has this to do with the goalies having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy scorers??? anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally (the exception of course being canada vs. italy). it looks like the goalies are getting too good. is this due to their equipment getting bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago). anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way???? mikko wihervaara >jarkko #14 -- t{m{ on nyt t{mm|nen testi sigun kai piti olla muutamarivinen nyt viel{ pari

i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils. actually, i am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. however, i am going to put an end to non-pittsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the pens. man, they are killing those devils worse than i thought. jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. he is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs. bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway. i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final regular season game. pens rule!!!

i'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands (oklahoma). i'm hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas. i've been under the impression that minnesota was one of, or possibly, the hockey state in the u.s. so why is the team moving to a city in texas? is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or were the stars really not making a profit? or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging? as much as i'd like to see the nhl only a 3 hour drive from me, i can't help but feel for the people in minnesota, unless they truly didn't support the team. opinions, please. steve hunter national weather service nexrad radar group norman, ok

i.e. double as much as the next player (among those kariya with 1+6). amazing! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- group b results: finland - czech republic 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2) 1st: 2nd: cze 0-1 petr hrbek 2 11:04 fin 1-1 mika alatalo 1 17:51 3rd: cze 1-2 jiri dolezal 3 5:04 cze 1-3 martin hostak 2 19:45 (en) penalties: fin 8*2min, cze 9*2min referee: vincent moreno, switzerland attendance: 4,300 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - germany - usa 6-3 (5-0,0-0,1-3) 1st: ger 1-0 raimond hilger 2 7:12 ger 2-0 gerd truntschka 3 11:16 ger 3-0 ernst kopf 3 11:55 ger 4-0 michael rumrich 3 16:06 ger 5-0 benoit doucet 1 18:45 2nd: 3rd: usa 5-1 derek plante 1 4:06 ger 6-1 dieter hegen 5 6:57 usa 6-2 craig johnson 1 7:30 usa 6-3 rob gaudreau 3 13:07 penalties: ger 7*2min, usa 10*2min referee: valeri bokarev, russia attendance: 11,000 -- ((\\ //| staffan axelsson \\ //|| etxonss@ufsa.ericsson.se \\_))//-|| r.s.h. contact for swedish hockey

have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? it seems that e.g. glove has become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are wearing "over size" jerseys. am i dreaming? if you watch old photos or films let say about ten years back, i think the difference is quite obvious. who is an expert on this, please let me know. (or have the goalies become bigger?) jarkko #14 (trouble in scoring?)

with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks (much to my delight) i noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the pens last year, and now 4 to the blues) and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive losses is, if there even is one... i'm pretty sure that the hawks have at least a 9 game losing streak, since they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that was) basically, i need something else to rag on my hawks-fan friend with :) mike, the insomniaced --- ***yes-rush-marillion-emerson, lake and palmer-genesis-dream theater*** * mike weintraub, aka jvi on irc ________.sig quote du jour________ * * mweintr@american.edu |"life is like a scissors-paper- |* * jedi@wave.cerf.net | stone game, none of the answers |* * the american university | is always right, but sometimes |* * washington, dc |_each one is"__neil peart, rush___|* ***go philadelphia phillies and vancouver canucks (3 down, 13 to go)***

have belfour and roenick done another disappearing act at chips are down time? when i saw them it looked like the blackhawks' defense might carry them along way in the playoffs. well they held st. louis to 17 shots in game 2 and lost. looks like maybe keenan had (has) some insight to me.

i'm personally expecting moog. blue played fairly decent (alright spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but moog has the experience. what did blue have going for him, nothing, what would happen in a tie game, the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out (at the very least until your team scores) blue didn't face that kind of pressure on tuesday. the bruins will come out storming that is for sure. i really think that this series is up to buffalo, boston (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad , as a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting. there game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo..... imho pat ellis p.s. go bruins go umaine black bears 42-1-2 number 1...... hockey east regulars season champions..... hockey east tournament champions>...... paul kariya, hobey baker award winner....... ncaa div. 1 hockey tournament champions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! m-a-i-n-e ggggooooooo bbbllluueeee!

what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final and now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !! after the 0:1 against italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun 0:6 by the russian team. now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the b-level. does anybody know if this wc is the qualification tournement for the olympic games '94 in lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them. hopp schwiiz daniel

	finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway in world champs. after two periods the score was still 0-0. this game was quite much similar to the first game finland played (against france). the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. in the third period juha riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so. the second goal was scored by kari harila, who shot straight from a faceoff behind the nowwegian goalie. saku koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. saku koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize. despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. i think that we will hear from this guy in the future.

news: ===== for the first time all season, the flames are now injury-free. the only player remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who, even when healthy, is not a major part of the team. trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against san jose. he potted his first of the year in that game, and has also scored goals in both game 1 and game 2 against los angeles. thoughts on game 1: ================== the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with los angeles 6-3 on sunday afternoon. they seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. they physically dominated the kings, but that was the only area they dominated in. the game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced l.a. defence and the shaky kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. particularily stupid was theoren fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren rychel's face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees. goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. he got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds. in fact, marty mcsorley's goal actually went in off chris dahlquist's skate in front of the net. thoughts on game 2: ================== the flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice. the first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the kings. but calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings, scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in game 1, but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while l.a. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to joel otto. l.a.'s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided. the kings' powerplay failed them when they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary's 7th goal. charlie huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury. the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. first, craig berube of calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason. granato drew a minor for some strange reason. (turtling perhaps). this was followed 30 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight. musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. hardy and yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (gregson thought that musil turtling amounted to fighting, but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing? where's this guy from.....) upcoming games: ============== friday april 23, at l.a. sunday april 25, at l.a. tuesday april 27, home to l.a. thursday april 29, at l.a.

(detroit, april 21) most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the detroit red wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the nhl. for the best goaltender in the world, felix potvin, six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior red wings team. 								alan p.s. we told you this would happen, roger. didn't we? i love it.....

speaking of roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln? i had him in my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that i've moved to a new news reader which doesn't have kill files, i find that he's gone. i must admit, however, that unlike gln, roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject doesn't touch on the leafs. ray skirsky rskirsky@qualcomm.com

hi guys.... what happened? 	1. potvin didn't let six goals by. 	2. wendel and andreychuk woke up. 	3. home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs 		the emotional edge. 	4. refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour leafs. 	a couple of comments: 	1. on gilmour: just because the guy isn't one of the three 	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team. someone posted 	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth 	place....plus, he walked away with the molson cup (given for 	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the 	regular season. 	2. on the officiating: i've heard gripes from both ends on this 	one. emotions are very high in this series; the rivalry is 	one of the stronger ones i know of. i do have to agree that the 	officiating last night was pro-leaf in general (except for whoever 	missed that slash on gilmour's hand). 	3. in general: i still think detroit has one of the better 	chances vs. pittsburgh (though i think the leafs would do better 	against the blues....but not as well if they made it out of the 	division). problem is, i like both these teams, though i'm 	supporting the leafs on the underdog principle. d 	by the way...gilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not 		playing aggressive hockey.... 	by the way....i'm not any sort of expert, nor do i claim to be. 		i just like watching a good matchup. 	tee hee hee...ooops! 	susan

while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory, i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis joseph. when a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do. joseph should be given the entire city of st. louis, because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled. as for the game on sunday. the blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt. one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks, looking for reasons to give them penalties. second, the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear. no linesman, no shot for brett(i can redirect anything)hull to redirect. on another of st. louis' goals, belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a st. louis player. finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease. no goalie, no way to stop the shot. i congratulate st. louis for beating the hawks. it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph won't be able to stop the powerful red wing attack. ____________________________________________________________________________ |the world reknown jason boskey | mail: bosk@uiuc.edu | |known throughout the world as the bosk |"christ, you know it ain't easy,| |all rights reserved, all lefts enhanced |you know how hard it can be, | |-----------------------------------------|the way things are goin' | |"here they come spinning out of the turn"|they're gonna crucify me" | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

did anyone see the montreal - quebec game yesterday? it was tight right down to the last second of the third period. in the overtime roy and hextall played like they were gods. ok, so montreal won! they deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. their second goal in overtime was also replayed, but i could not tell if it was the montreal player who kicked it in. the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick. anyways, montreal is back into the series. dave vergolini michigan state university vergolin@euler.lbs.msu.edu

there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are. that's bullshit. anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers. it's ok to follow and be concerned about your home team. but to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan.a true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team. when i visit pittsburgh, i'll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn't sign barry bonds. lert's say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years, i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team. i'll still follow it and bitch about it. but i won't waste my money on mediocre teams. -p{ravin ratnam

here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list:			 in a discussion between me and chris lerch, the subject of springfield's 1st round upset of the providence bruins came up. chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians. he noted that the offices for the league are in spring. and many ex-indians are working for the ahl. furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup finals between roch and spring, that the amerks charged favoritism by the office and that: "...there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and staff attending all games with the springfield brass, including sitting in their box for the game in springfield and, according to the rochester media, openly cheering for springfield." certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true. i don't know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises questions about president jack butterfield's leadership. btw- this was posted with the permission of chris ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + bri farenell			farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu + + ahl, ecac and boston bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey		 + + adirondack red wings, calder cup champs: '81 '86 '89 '92	 + + clarkson hockey, ecac tournament champs: '66 '91 '93		 + + glens falls high hockey, ny division ii state champs: '90 '91 + + ahl fans: join the ahl mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as vancouver outscored winnipeg 3-2. 	the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. the jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the numbers that counted: goals. 	vancouver's big line produced again, with centre cliff ronning and left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of bautin and ulanov. mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals. 	however, as in the first game, the jets worked hard to take the game to the canucks in the second period. the jets dominated the second, checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. 	the hard work paid off late in the second, when tie domi caught vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1. 	domi's goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush to the canuck's collapsing defence. the canucks were unwilling to do anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds. the jets were allowed to set up and make plays. 	both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably. mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive. selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck zone. the canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead. 	a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third. the jet's tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mclean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2. 	the canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off. this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight winnipeg defence that were never supported. 	however, as in the first and second canuck goals, a jet defensive lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the winnipeg comeback. with the faceoff in the winnipeg zone, pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with no jet defender anywhere near him. bure, who had been invisible in the game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance. 	by then it was too late for the jets to come back. essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack. canucks 3, winnipeg 2. 	next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games. - 30 -
