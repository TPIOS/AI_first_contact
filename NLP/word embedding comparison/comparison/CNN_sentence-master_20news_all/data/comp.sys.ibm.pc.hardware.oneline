i've acquired an old logitech series 7 (3-button) mouse, and i'm told that this is a bus mouse. does anyone want to unload an old (pc-clone) bus-card for this mouse? email replies to: bobmon@cs.indiana.edu thanks.

well, my 14inch vga 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just bit the bullet. i pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power light went out with a pop. gawd, it's only been two and half years. how long would normal monitors last? i think the problem with my monitor is the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (i needed to have my contrast all the way to the max...). and the screen did flicker from time to time. is this normal (hehehe) or do i just have the worst of luck??? question: what do i do now???? buy a new one? get it fixed? save up for a *really* good one and get by with a cheap ega monitor for now? i rather save my money to upgrade my 386sx to 486-66 though... thanks! -- =============================================================================== what engineers say: extensive effort is being applied on a fresh approach to the problem. what they *really* mean: we just hired three new guys; we'll let them kick it around for a while. ==================(robert) bobby yung_____ry01@lehigh.edu======================

i was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem i am having with my gateway 2000 486-33dx vl-bus system with ati graphics ultra pro lb. when i have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever i use it in 800x600 (windows, autocad, gifs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter. at the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4" bar of black. the screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio. while i can manually change the v-size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway. i've called gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all. two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer. they even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they told me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card. but their customer support is a different story... so, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what to do. hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so i know i'm not the only one with this problem. thanks in advance. jude m. greer jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu p.s. i already tried going into the mach 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card. doesn't work. whenever i try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

since i've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding gateways lately on here, i thought i post my recent pleasant experiences. my machine (4dx2-66v) this past friday. this was two weeks to the day from when i called the order in. upon unboxing it i found everything to be in perfect order. all the peripherals i ordered were properly installed (jumbo-250 & cd-rom). i was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the gateway documentation. all software came with the original disks and manuals. the gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. the ati gup came with build59 drivers. all other software i specified (microsoft office) was properly installed. the machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. it's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. i think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it. it's up and running dos 6.0 with no problems. i've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications. i used the dos 6.0 interlink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2k baud. it then "maps" the other machines two hard disks as my disks f & g. you can "cd" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. it's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. it's not a two way street. the other machine is the server and this machine is the client. so thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. for a bundled dos utility its very impressive. my jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117mb of data. i also by-passed any potential gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a nec 4fg. i love this monitor! so, i'm glad there is some good news gateway stories and i'm glad it was me. (now if it just keeps working). :-) 					john -- john gayman, wa3wbu uucp: uunet!wa3wbu!john packet: wa3wbu @ wb3eah

the wd1002a-wx1, wd1004a-wx1, wdxt-gen2 and the wd1004-27x can be modified to operate in tandy 1000 series computers, models sx, tx and the original or "a" version. these computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (irq2) instead of irq5, the ibm standard. to modify the wd1002a-wx1 or the wd1002-27x to operate in these systems, you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position w-7. then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (w-7). to complete the modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch s-1 (2 rows of 8 pins). please note that any physical modification to your western digital hard disk controller voids the warranty on your board. to modify the wd1004a-wx1, wdxt-gen2 or the wd1004-27x for your tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position w-27. this will change the interrupt from irq5 to irq2. xt controllers for floppy disk drives wd1002a-fox -

help.... i need to implement com3 and com4 on a board that i'm designing and i'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of com3 and com4. i have the io adresses and the fact that com3 shares irq4 with com1 and com4 shares irq3 with com2, except exactly how this irq sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing com1/2 does not allow irq sharing. does the standard??? allow for a different irq to be used and if so how. please answer by email to :- neil@stone.oz.au thanks in advance neil watkinson.

hi all, i have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c. does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data to the kb (as opposed to standard numlock/... on-off, typeamatic specs.) from inside the pc software? i have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 pc-kb interface. anyone have any ideas? (except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above, which wouldn't look too neat, besides, what would one do from an xt?) great thanks in advance, andrew.

i would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept: - com1 + com2 (currently on irq 4 and 3) - lpt1 (irq7) - bus mouse (irq5) - sound card (no idea what to do - can be set to any) - using irq2 for bus mouse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other problems. i could, i suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable the second port on the super io card, but i really want to have them both available. could the sound card use irq2 without horsing up the works? all replies apppreciated - and i only just subscribed to this newsgroup - i assume there is an faq somewhere (rather, i'm sure someone will tell me about it....) thanks mark fraser
hi. i recently switched my old amiga 500 with a 486dx-50. my computer configuration is : 486dx-50 mhz. 8/256 kb eisa (micronics motherboard asic eisa 50mhz) 16mb ram st3283n 248 mb harddisk, scsi ultrastor24f eisa cache controller when i use norton6.0 harddisk benchmark, i get a harddisk data transfer about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1mb/sec. is that good ? i thought that with eisa i could get about 2mb/sec. somewhere in the manual for my harddisk i have read, that some host adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk performance in that system, do i need that ? a guy i know, gets a hd transfer about 1.2mb/sec, and he has an st3283a and a isa 486dx-50, how can a isa with the same system be faster ? is there anything that i can do to get a speedier harddisk ? thanks. phantom@diku.dk (e-mail is preffered) working on a sign......

hello. i hope somebody out here can help me. i am currently working on a project where i am trying to communicate from an ibm 386 with phoenix bios, using c++, to a board that i made with an intel 8085 cpu with uart chip. the board works fine with the transmit command and terminal emulation mode of kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when i try c++. i need to access the unit i built using c, because i have a sizable chunk of c code that i will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085. i have included the assembly code that i am running and the c++ code that i am trying to use. if anyone can show me something that i am doing blatantly incorrectly or that i am missing because of my lack of knowledge about rs-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. i wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, the leds will indicate this. two c++ programs that i have written do nothing, but set up com port 2 and send the 0x20 character. one uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h. i have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ). currently, i am at a loss as to what may be wrong. any hardware gurus out there want to comment? 						thanks alot, 						hubert de jesus 						dejesus@eniac.seas.upenn.edu 				intel asm command equ 3000h ;command register on 8155 porta equ 3001h ;port a on 8155 timerlo equ 3004h ;high 8 bits of 8155 timer timerhi equ 3005h ;low 8 bits of 8155 timer uartdata equ e000h ;uart data register uartcmd equ e001h ;uart command register org 4000h ;sram location 	 mvi a,08h		 ;set low timer bits sta timerlo mvi a,40h		 ;set high timer bits sta timerhi mvi a,11111101b ;start timer & enable port a sta command mvi a,11h ;display 11 on 7-segment leds sta porta mvi a,00h		 ;clear uart command sta uartcmd sta uartcmd sta uartcmd mvi a,01000000b		 ;internally reset uart sta uartcmd 	 lda uartdata ;remove extraneous data 	 mvi a,01001111b ;init uart for 8 data bits, sta uartcmd ; no parity, 1 stop bit, 64x async mvi a,00100111b ;enable transmit and receive sta uartcmd init: lda uartcmd		 ;read status register ani 02h ;is rxrdy? jz init ;no, loop lda uartdata ;read data character cpi ' ' ;is character = 0x20? jnz init ;no, loop mvi a,22h ;character received, sta porta ; display 22 on 7-segment leds hlt end c++ using bioscom() #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <bios.h> #define init 0 #define send 1 #define receive 2 #define status 3 #define com2 1 void main() { char abyte; abyte = 0xa3; bioscom( init, abyte, com2 ); printf( "initialized comm port 2\n" ); while( !( bioscom( status, 0, com2 ) & 0x4000 ) ) ; abyte = ' '; bioscom( send, abyte, com2 ); printf( "sent start character\n" ); } 			c++ using int86() #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <dos.h> #include <bios.h> main() { union regs registers; registers.h.ah = 0x00; registers.h.al = 0xa7; registers.x.dx = 0x01; int86( 0x14, &registers, &registers ); printf( "com2 initialized\n" ); registers.h.ah = 0x01; registers.h.al = 0x20; registers.x.dx = 0x01; int86( 0x14, &registers, &registers ); printf( "sent start character\n" ); }

howdy, sorry if this has been covered before: one of my pc illiterate friends asked me to help him install drdos 6.0 on his nec powermate sx (386sx 16). of course, i said "no problem" and went to work. unfortunately, the drdos refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation, even though i am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old dos. after openning it up i discovered it was using an 8-bit seagate scsi controller on a st-157n scsi 40mbtye drive. i then booted with drdos 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if i could access the drive. lo and behold the primary 46.5 mbyte partition was intact (created by dos 3.1 no less, i didn't think you could go over a 32mbyte partition in the older doses. i could be wrong...). i then tried to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do. i am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a scsi drive (i kinda expected it to work just like an ide/mfm/rll drive for dos installations). any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for "throw it in the garbage and buy a new pc")... thanks in advance, paul "mr. scsi... not!" fincke
i'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my pc. i am running linux as my main os, with a small dos partition left for my flatmates' games. my current setup is a 386sx-25 (amd) with 387sx-25 (itt - i think) and 9 mbytes of 70ns simms, and (120+100)mbyte ide. basically i have two choices 1) get a 386dx-40 + 387dx-40 or 2) get some sort of 486. unfortunately i live in the uk where computer prices are far too high. the first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at this price for a sx-25. i have a couple of questions. 1) how much of an improvement in speed should i notice if i get a 386dx+copro. remember i'm using a 32 bit os, and alot of floating point operations. 2) how much faster would a 486dx-33 be than the 386dx-40+copro ? should i get an upgradeable m/board with a 386dx-40 and wait for amd/pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? 	any experiences will be most helpful ... 		kenny. ps. example prices: 	386dx-40+copro m/board	~$270 	486dx33	m/board		~$580 ----------------------------------------------------------- kenneth macdonald		e-mail kenny@castle.ed.ac.uk dept. of geology & geophysics university of edinburgh		scotland -----------------------------------------------------------

(tc1024.drv is the vga driver provided by the manufacture) - general protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. what is address 0001:xxxx means? i have absolutely on idea what this mean. i tried commented out the tsr programs from autoexec.bat, no help. is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling win31 what it suppose to know. looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running. please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. i'm willing to try anything. -------------- steve chu at&t bell labs holmdel, nj

hi, i am going through a box of old ibm card and came across one called a rapid technology squeeze card. it is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on it and a big chip that has 'c-cube' on it. no connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board. it is a 16-bit board. any ideas what it is? phil -------------------------------------------------------------------- phil hunt "wherever you go, there you are!" howtek, inc.		 internet: phil@howtek.mv.com uucp: {decvax|harvard}!mv!howtek!phil

hello, 	i have a 486sx25 isa machine with pheonix bios. currently i have 8 megabytes of ram installed via eight 1 mg simms on the motherboard: ie. both banks are full, and there is no space for more simms. i am thinking of running os2 on my machine and possibly linux with x windows, and i know that more ram would be helpful. however with simms, the only solution i can see is to sell my 8 megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg simms for about $400 used. apart from the fact that i can't afford the price right now, the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather avoid... so my question is, do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work well with a 486 isa machine. i have seen some being sold used for about $90 with 4 mg with space for another 4mg's. if these boards do work, how do they do it? is a device driver needed, or will the bios pickup the extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board? i know that the isa expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 simm memory is 32 bits, so probably all of this is just wishful thinking... however any help is truly appreciated. -eric ebosco@us.oracle.com

i was recently loaned an older dec 210 286 at work, and i have the option of adding an additional western digital hard-drive to the machine. the existing drive is currently a western digital as well, and is working fine, but i do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup. the first drive is currently formatted to tandy dos v3.3 but i am eventually going to upgrade both to ms dos v 5.0 the drives themselves are both model number wd95044-a circa 5-07-1991 they are 782 cyl 4 head drives. a note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are for setting up the master/slave. originally, the drive in the machine had none. currently, i was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave. when booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive. it does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error. hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, i would not even know how to do that. any and all help on this is great fully appreciated. if not, a number for western digital might just do as good! swood -- hunting over in michigan? don't despair - no closed season on: opossum, porcupine, weasel, red squirrel, skunk, starlings, feral pigeons, english sparrows, ground squirrel & woodchuck anyway trout season opens the last saturday this month.

i never thought i'd contribute to a gateway thread, either pro or con, but my spleen could use a little venting. the scenario: 	1 - ordered a dx2/50 w/ ultrastor 34f local bus hd controller 	2 - receive system 10 days after ordering (happy) 	3 - discover ultrastor 14f isa hd controller inside (unhappy) 	4 - call gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days 		(getting happier) 	5 - new controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 	6 - call gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days 			(cooling off, the end is in sight) 	7 - this controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad 		(very unhappy) gateway's solution: they will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) 	and have on-site service install it for me. but, i have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 m-f. i say, no way i've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and i don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work. also, my 30 day return period is almost over and i've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes. so, the whole thing is going back. i was extremely upset when i began this post because the support rep told me that i would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me. fortunately, i just spoke to customer service and they are going to have ups come and pick everything up gratis. the only downside is that now i have to order another computer. i would really like to try gateway again, i'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to customer service or tech support again... i think their products are great for the most part, but i'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. are other mail order companies as difficult to contact? i know gateway is booming, and for good reason, but i don't know if i can take it again. oh well, i feel better now... -- -----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____----- | mark devaney - hear me now and believe me later | | georgia institute of technology, atlanta georgia, 30332		 | | internet: markd@cc.gatech.edu 					 |
hello i have recently suffered from various problems concerning an adaptec 1542a controller. problem 1: floppy disk drive doesn't work. there's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. unfortunately i have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). i would like to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located. problem 2: my hard disks refuse to boot. with my two scsi hd's (rodime, miniscribe) i get a message 'missing operating system', even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. if i boot from a quantum i might get as far as getting the ms-dos version information. this might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. are there any jumpers that could affect the hd causing such errors? 	thanks in advance jouni _______________________________________________________________________________ jouni marttila - yo-kyl{ 11 b 25, 20540 turku, finland - +358 21 374624____ jmarttila@abo.fi - jmarttila@finabo - abovax::jmarttila - jjmartti@utu.fi__ pgp-key available via finger jmarttila@abo.fi ___________________________
hello folks! i have an archive xl5580 (internal qic-80) tape drive, which is pretty comparable to the colorado jumbo 250. since i have two floppy drives in my system, i'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by archive to attach my tape drive as a third floppy device. the problem: although the dos-based qicstream software works just fine, both the norton and central point backup programs for windows fail unless i switch the machine to non-turbo speed (i'm using a 486dx/33 eisa). since the dos software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it? has anyone seen similar problems? any solutions? thanks in advance. -- +-------------------+----------------------------+---------------------------+ | jerry j. shekhel | molecular simulations inc. | time just fades the pages | | drummers do it... | burlington, ma usa | in my book of memories. | | ... in rhythm! | jerry@msi.com | -- guns n' roses | +-------------------+----------------------------+---------------------------+

we have a gateway 486dx50 with a smc elite16 series ethercard plus. when we use ncsa ftp to send from the gateway with hash turned on, we see 4 hash marks immediately. then the computer r e a l l y drags. if we turn off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match the speed when we receive to the gateway. it doesn't matter if we send from the gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled. does anyone know any more about this? is there a fix? the gateway was purchased in june, 1992. please respond directly. you wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this system. thanks.

(b) rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated) 		to keep the structure of the os/2 newsgroup heirarchy 		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup 		for os/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and 		technical aspects of os/2 in an unmoderated setting. 	(c) create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated) 		it will be devoted to os/2 system setup topics, including the 		availability of device drivers, compatibility information, 		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall 		performance optimization. 	(d) create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated) 		it will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues. 	(e) create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated) 		it will provide a forum for os/2 system bug reports, bug 		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system 		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

hi, i just inherited an ncr 1204 external floppy. this thing has every port known to man on the back. the question is: does anyone know how to connect this thing to a pc. what hardware is needed? software? tia, alex p.s. please respond directly. i am not on this alias.
i recently bought a monichrome vga monitor for $99 that will do 1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. however, it is a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 khz horizontal, i think. with my trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62 - not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to something else, especially if it wants to do text, i suppose. anyway: - is there any way that i can use this as a general-purpose vga display with a 1-meg trident 8900c card? - if not, can i do so with some sort of different vga card? 				peter desnoyers --
while rummaging through a box of old pc (5150) parts, i found a half-size board that looks like a comm port board. it was made by forte data systems and has a copyright date of 1986 on it. the board provides a male 24-pin connector and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled a b c. i plugged it into my pc and ran advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each time, but the system did not recognise a comm port. does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it? i could use another comm port if it's free. bryan

dear all, 	i am trying to get my standard connection going with ka9q (pa0gri113016) and a gvc nic-2000 ethernet card. i know that my router and modem is working because i am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it. 	however, after a time, it crashes randomly. help would be greatly appreciated. 	i suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the pc. i am running with a 386sx/33, 2 mb ram. the ethernet card is configured for irq 5, ports 0x360-0x37f. 	thanks in advance. i know that it's not much to go on, but i don't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry. please send mail. elliott

hi 	i have an orchid fahrenheit vlb with 2mb of dram. it is an s3 86c805 based card. i had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of dram for the video, and thanks to orchid, i got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual. i assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so i guess i should be glad they didn't just say "buy the memory from us" or something like that.) 	the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode. my ati ultra plus can handle that, given 2mb of memory. all the 2mb buys you on the fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. just one more mode. geez. had i known, i wouldn't have bothered. i asked them why, and all i got was "your point is well taken, but orchid's software developers are busy with other projects." 	so, to get to the point, finally, are there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes? i'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken. 	if you want these modes, steer away from orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. vlb or va/vlb), at least until their developers are "less busy". if the magazines are to believed, i've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint. 	please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where i can get them. 800x600x32k is ok, but i coulda gotten that with my ati vga wonder xl. thanks. donyee@athena.mit.edu

i have a 486dx33 isa system with 4 meg. i am using a diamond speedstar hicolor video card with 1 meg vram and a standard ctx 14-in svga monitor. when i am running windows, and i have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and i close the active application, window erasure is very slow. the part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly. this also happens when i iconify an application. the hicolor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it. i am running at 800x600x32k. is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that i am unaware of? thanks. (you can mail to me directly if you wish, at genek@cs.ucsb.edu).
hi, recently, when i run the norton disk surface test, i realize a slow down in harddisk accessing. at begining of the test, the harddisk will be checked at the speed that usually is. as the surface test scaned half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured. the expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes. i try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none. the surface test only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the original speed after it gets over the section. i am wondering whether it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. anyway help or comment will be appriciate.... shane cheney wang

this might be a silly question but i have to ask it anyway. i am in the process of purchasing an eisa/vl bus 486 dx2-66 computer and i found two places that sell machines that have what i want and have the same price. the first is ares and they use a cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with opti chip set, the other is micron (formerly edge technology) and they use the micronics eisa/vlb motherboard. i said that this might be a silly question since i believe that micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while i never heard of cache! i am however leaning towards the ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years). micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired edge technologies and i'm not sure how much i should trust the company. i would really appreciate any input on this. is the micron machine the clear choice? does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? has anyone ever heard of cache motherboards? should i go with micron just because it has the micronics motherboard? etc. thanks very much in advance for any information. -- mohammad al-ansari
i'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow. something like 90% of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick, and this is in a program that does nothing but printf() and joyread(). the problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like smartdrv ) and so it is a slow as hell interface. can i read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling? and that isn't platform or clockspeed specific? thanks, brianzex

it depends on what you'd like your joystick for. i've seen gravis joysticks at radio shack. they seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand. i have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims. one redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick. i recently purchased a ch flightstick. there aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. i'm currently using it for the wing commander series and red baron. works quite well. the large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free. the buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well). there are other models made by ch that can go up or down in features. for price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 i paid for a ch flightstick. i think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel. best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy. just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch. if you're only playing games such as castle wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a gravis gamepad. they look like a nintendo control pad but i don't know much beyond that. -- will christie | aatchoo! | philosophy: the principles and university of manitoba | uh-oh... | science of thought and reality winnipeg, mb, canada | i'm leaking | philosopher: someone who thinks chrstie@ccu.umanitoba.ca | brain lubricant. | they're useful to society

methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called, "windows 3.1 runs slowly". * msdos configuration: the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your config.sys and autoexec.bat files. if you follow the instructions, you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with smartdrive (this is the default setup). you'll also notice that your system runs much, much slower -- in both windows *and* msdos. see the section called, "windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system up. * windows configuration: to get the adaptec 1542 to work with windows, make sure that the "[388enh]" section of the system.ini file contains the entry: 	virtualhdirq=off i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry to system.ini, but i'm not sure. if this doesn't work for you, you might want to try adding some more lines: 	virtualhdirq=off 	systemrombreakpoint=false 	emmexclude=a000-cfff (you probably don't need the above lines, though.) the "systemrombreakpoint" entry is used to enable support for memory managers like qemm/386max (only needed if you use such programs). * windows 3.1 runs slowly: once you do get windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that your system is running much slower than before. if it's not, it's probably because: 1. you happen to be using aspi4dos.sys version 3.1 in your 	config.sys file. congratulations -- this appears to be a 	winning solution. 2. you are very lucky. whether your luck will hold out remains to 	be seen .... if your system is running much slower than before, this is almost definitely caused by smartdrive with double-buffering. according to the windows documentation, and the microsoft technical note #q81808 ("smartdrive double buffering required with aspi4dos.sys"), you must use smartdrive with double-buffering enabled. while this works, it really slows down your pc; i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a factor of 5 (five). as i consider this unacceptable, i looked for other solutions. unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering. if you do, windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows 3.1. what you can do is one of the following: 1. use other drivers that provide double-buffering. it is my 	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused 	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in 	smartdrive. 2. use a driver that provides "vds" services ("vds" stands for 	"virtual dma services"). this is a standard, which is supported 	by windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like 	the 1542) to work with windows. after trashing my hard disk countless times, i found the following solutions, none of which require using smartdrive (note, however, that i am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *not* caused by these solutions, but might be -- see below). while the following does not require smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended, as this makes windows run much, much faster: 1. if you do not have the aspi4dos.sys driver, or you do not need aspi functions (for controlling a cdrom, tape drive, more than two physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the scsiha.sys driver to your config.sys file, e.g.: 	driver=c:\scsiha.sys /v386 (windows needs the "/v386" option.) this driver must be loaded into low memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies about 16-20k. as of november 1992, the scsiha.sys driver could be obtained from the adaptec bbs at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's still there). 2. if you need aspi functions and have the aspi4dos.sys driver, version 3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the aspi4dos.sys and scsiha.sys drivers in your config.sys file, e.g.: 	driver=c:\aspi4dos.sys 	driver=c:\scsiha.sys /v386 amazingly enough, the scsiha.sys driver can also be loaded high (assuming you have dos 5.0); i would have thought that this would crash my system, but it doesn't. i asked adaptec's technical support about this, and they said that loading scsiha.sys high should be fine as long as aspi4dos.sys is loaded low. on my system, not using scsiha.sys with aspi4dos 3.0a would occasionally cause windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my c:\windows\*.grp files would be corrupted). for me, these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from progman.exe the default windows shell, and vice-versa. this is the reason scsiha.sys may be necessary. i have absolutely no idea if scsiha.sys is necessary with versions of aspi4dos earlier than 3.0. note that many people can use aspi4dos 3.0 or 3.0a without scsiha.sys; they do not seem to have any problems at all. i consider these people lucky. others, like me, have had all sorts of problems. 3. in my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is to upgrade to aspi4dos 3.1. the scsiha.sys driver is no longer needed. unfortunately, while you could get previous aspi4dos upgrades from the adaptec bbs, the aspi4dos 3.1 driver is not available from the adaptec bbs. as far as i know, there are only three ways to get a copy: * you can buy the new (as of november 1992) adaptec ez scsi driver 	kit, which supposedly includes aspi4dos 3.1 as well as other 	drivers, such as cdrom drivers. i believe the list price is 	around $75. * if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi4dos, you 	can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for 	around $30. * a copy of aspi4dos 3.1 is included in central point pc tools 8.0 	for msdos. note that the documentation and driver are stored in 	different directories. note further that only aspi4dos is 	included; the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two 	hard disks are not included. this is where i obtained my copy 	of aspi4dos 3.1. note, however, that i am now getting occasional parity errors with windows. in all probability, defective hardware in my pc is causing this, as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above solutions. however, because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this). i've run various memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no problems. this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk i/o). however, i'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem. ***** floppy-controller-based tape backup devices: there are two possible problems with using the adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the colorado memory systems jumbo 250: 1. tape backups/restores can take a very long time. the tape drive constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. 2. tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors. (this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so i'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my 1542.) * tape backups/restores take a long time: if you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may have to adjust the adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best results when using the tape drive. normally, while doing a tape backup or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with only an occasional pause. however, the default bus timing on the adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop, start and stop, every few seconds. this causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer than necessary. the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the adaptec uses dma to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk. the floppy dma needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma, the tape drive stops, rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). the default bus timing on the adaptec (which is really dma timing) is "too large". for example, when a backup is done, data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the tape. because the default timing on the adaptec "hogs" the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive. as a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops, because data is not fed to it quickly enough. the solution is to change the adaptec's bus on/off timing. the default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off. the "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds. this can be done in one of two ways: * if you have aspi4dos, you can use the "/n" option. for example, i use a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that i use the following line in my config.sys file: 	device=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4 note that there is no space between the "/n" and the "4". * if you don't have aspi4dos, your only recourse is to try to find a program called "setscsi.exe", which is very difficult to find. the reason is that adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to want this widely distributed. i once asked someone who worked for adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere. if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet, you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; i believe that there are a couple of sites that have it. if you do find a copy, you run it like so: 	setscsi -n:4 this adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds. running setscsi.exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults. note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi.exe if you use aspi4dos; setscsi.exe crashed my system if aspi4dos was loaded. i could use setscsi.exe with scsiha.sys, however. do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it above 11 microseconds. if you lower it too low, the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower. for me, 4 microseconds works fine. this value may work fine for you, or you may have to adjust it downwards a little. once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores should run faster. also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that i have intentionally not described), unless you know what you are doing. bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by starving memory refresh. a program called bustifix.exe exists on the adaptec bbs. unless this has been upgraded since i last checked (which has been a while), this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files. this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others. however, when i tried running this program with my 1542a, my system crashed. at the time, i was running scsiha.sys, and i didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it. maybe this old program works only with the 1542b, although the docs say that it works with the 1542a? * erratic tape operations or too many tape errors: this "problem" may or may not exist. although it existed on my system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so i'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542. symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the tape head: 1. backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors, resulting in an aborted tape backup. 2. tape backup works, but the tape compare fails. 3. the tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often. unlike the above-mentioned problem ("tape backups/restores take a long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds, this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so. 4. fastback plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices. other programs, like central point backup and the cms jumbo software (assuming that you have a cms jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive, but fastback plus 3.1 cannot. 5. too many tape read errors. although i do not know what is causing this problem, i discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it. a few months ago, i upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy controller. as i already had a floppy controller on the 1542, i initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller. after a while, i decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard. when i did this, the tape drive (a cms jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically, and fastback plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive. i don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. on the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542. on the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542. i did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables. i don't know what the cause really is; however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller. ***** sound cards: many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and this is typically done using dma. like the tape drive dma, the adaptec's dma can conflict with the sound card dma. unlike that of the tape dma, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message). what happens is that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a parity error. usually, getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware. i've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo, recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.). like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the adaptec's "bus on" timing. see the section on tape drives for information on how this is done. note, however, that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error. the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient). disk caches, the speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this. ***** miscellaneous info: this section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors. much of it is merely information that i've heard or read about, and have not verified. i believe that the following information is correct, but i'm not sure. use it at your own risk. * with qemm 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "db=" parameter (e.g., "db=2"), unless you are using the aspi4dos driver. if you don't, qemm will crash/hang at bootup. although the qemm manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the qemm command line (at least, this occurred with the qemm 6.00 install program -- i haven't tested any other version). earlier versions of qemm probably need this parameter, but i'm not sure (i've never used a version earlier than 6.00). if you use aspi4dos, you do not need to give qemm the "db=" parameter. * some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size. to support hard disks with capacities over 1gb, you need to get a new rom bios from adaptec. i'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542bs being sold by adaptec. * to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542, you need a scsi cdrom drive and some drivers. note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces (non-scsi); these drives cannot be used with the 1542. you have three choices for cdrom drivers (i have no idea how well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. you can buy adaptec's ez scsi driver package, which lists for 	something like $75. if you already have older adaptec drivers, 	you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around $30. contact 	adaptec for details. the ez scsi package supposedly contains 	everything that you need. 2. you can buy the corelscsi! driver package, which is made by the 	same people that make coreldraw! this package contains cdrom 	drivers, scsi tape drivers, worm drivers, etc. i do not know 	the list price, but i've seen this package sold for around 	$80-$90. note that corelscsi! does not come with the aspi4dos 	driver, which is needed. if you do not already have aspi4dos, 	you may be better off getting adaptec's ez scsi instead. 3. [this method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been 	obsoleted by adaptec's ez scsi kit, but i'm mentioning it in 	case someone already has these drivers.] you can use the 	drivers in the adaptec asw-1410 kit (aspi4dos) and the asw-410 	kit (aspi cdrom drivers). you will have to get a copy of 	mscdex.exe (a high-level cdrom driver), if it is not included in 	the asw-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin 	boards. * to use a scsi tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows how to talk to a scsi tape drive. software that i've heard about are (again, like the above section on cdrom drives, i have no idea how well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information): 1. central point pc tools 8.0 for msdos supposedly supports a large 	number of scsi tape drives. it comes with scsi drivers 	(aspi4dos 3.1) as well as central point backup. 2. the corelscsi! driver package contains a scsi tape backup 	program (see the above section on cdrom drives for more 	details). however, note that corelscsi! does not come with, but 	requires, aspi4dos. * i've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations: 1. 1542 scsi controller with hard disk rom bios. 2. 1542 scsi controller w/bios and adaptec aspi drivers. 3. 1542 scsi controller w/bios, adaptec aspi drivers, and 	corelscsi! drivers/programs. i imagine that adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration: 4. 1542 scsi controller w/bios and ez scsi drivers (including aspi 	drivers). * those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4dos driver (you need this driver before you can use this program). i've never used this version of gnu tar, but i've heard that it works (i don't know how well, though). if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet, a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites: 	pd1:<msdos.dskutl> 	aspibin.zip 67841 920131 gnu tar for scsi tape drives, adaptec 154xx 	aspipat.zip 21206 920131 patches for aspibin relative to gnu tar 1.10 	aspisrc.zip 221370 920131 src for gnu tar for scsi tape, adaptec ctrlr i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve; unixforum might have it, if any forum does. * as far as msdos is concerned, the 1542a and the 1542b controllers are the same; with msdos, the 1542a should work as well as the 1542b. however, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and there is at least one (non-msdos) program that initially did not work with a 1542a, but did work with a 1542b (bsd386 -- a 386 version of bsd unix). * in case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my config.sys file: 	files=40 	buffers=40 	break=on 	stacks=10,256 	device=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff 	dos=high,umb 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p note that i'm using qemm and aspi4dos 3.1. if i were using aspi4dos 3.0 or 3.0a, i'd probably have to use a config.sys that looked like: 	files=40 	buffers=40 	break=on 	stacks=10,256 	device=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff 	dos=high,umb 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /v386 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p if i weren't using aspi4dos, i'd probably use something that looked like: 	files=40 	buffers=40 	break=on 	stacks=10,256 	device=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /v386 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom db=32 dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff 	dos=high,umb 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p however, if i used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if i planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, i would still need some way of changing the adaptec's bus on/off times. the first two versions of config.sys take care of this, but this last version doesn't.  local variables: fill-column:	72 eval:		(auto-fill-mode nil) end:

i recently purchased the then current pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed to nec 3fgx monitor upgrade). buy this pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now get a bigger hd - 340mb with @256 hd cache. 30 days ago, when i bought this pkg., it was 245mb with @132k hd cache. this is a great deal although it is generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' zeos (ctx) monitor for $99 more i believe. whether you also upgrade to the diamond viper video card is your choice. i stayed with the diamond speedstar pro. zeos tech support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. the hardest part about buying a zeos is the wait till it is delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! there are quite a few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with zeos.

hello world, i'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an ibm pc for teaching purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 and 1 = 1) so that the students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally logical, for example. every instruction should show some 'working', and not just alter register/memory/port contents. does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code, in pascal or modula-2, that would show me where i'm going wrong in writing my simulator?

hi folks i have 2 hd first is an seagate 130mb the second a cdc 340mb (with a future domain no ram) i'd like to change my 2 controller ide & scsi and buy a new one with ram (at least 1mb) that could controll all of them any companies? how many $? and is it possible via hw or via sw select how divide the ram cache for 2 hd? (for example using dos that is about all on one hd i'd like to reserve ram cache just to it) thanks to all write at rosa@ghost.sm.dsi.unimi.it
	just wanted to ask a question. i bought a hard disk drive second-hand the other day, and i opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it. it's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk. i don't know if disk drives for the apple (or mac) are different from ones used in at clones, so could someone tell me if i could use this hard disk on my at clone? if not, what did i just purchase? it's a quantum prodrive. it's dated 1988 on the green board. will i need a controller/add-in card? all the help is much appreciated. thanks! :) pc

i'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system: 486-33 dx, 16 mb of ram on a novell 3.11 network monitor: nec 4fge, capable of 76 hz vertical refresh rate major considerations: i expect i will work mostly in windows, but with some dos applications and i would want decent speed in dos. i do mostly word processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics. with a 15" monitor, i expect i will work mostly in 800x600 and 256 colors seems plenty, but i'd like like the image to be sharp, fast, and rock solid. other considerations: i sometimes run a unix clone (coherent) and i understand that some companies (e.g. diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers. i might move to os/2 if i decide i need better speed and reliability than i get with windows for my database work and multitasking. i don't have a local bus motherboard--i'm not sure how much to invest in an isa video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later). i like buying things from companies that treat their customers well. if you have any advice for me, i'd love to hear it via email or post. thanks. |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ david m. todd ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| |department of psychology, university of massachusetts, amherst, ma 01003 usa| |phone: 413/545-0158 ___ <david.todd@psych.umass.edu> ____ fax: 413/545-0996|

i started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies. the summary: ctx 14": nasty, low quality. avoid. ctx 15" proscan: not as good as some other makes; however, cheap. main problem seems poor quality control. some reported pincushioning (the problem i had), others poor focus, etc, etc. i complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (i dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. it's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. i'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. certainly, a trinitron (say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range. conclusion: if you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. it probably won't be when you get it, but has good potential. chris

ok..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post. here's the "official" response from orchid.. orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) should (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start on april 15, i have no confirmation that production did start on this day just the word of the tech on the other line. now the flame...... you would think a company like orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs. very poor tech support (the first 2 times i called i must have spoke with the janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time i talked to a tech named "paul" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on. until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy or recommend orchid products. flame off..... again thanks to all of you who answered my post. terry

i've been intently following the mag thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail. there seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx15f. one article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"). well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. it's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. the fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters. what i'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? i don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections? -- ............................................................... : comments and opinions are mine - not bnr's : : doug adcock adcock@bnr.ca : : bell-northern research research triangle park, nc : ...............................................................

hi to all you pc gurus! i'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked, but i don't know the answer :) i've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a seagate 40 meg hard drive. i occasionally find corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? as might be expected, i would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. i'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem), but i would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is. also, can someone give me an opinion on dos 6.0? are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if i don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? much thanks in advance for any help. mitchel soltys soltys@radonc.unc.edu

i have some used, but working, parts available for the original ibm laptop - the pc convertible. if you have one of these things, and still are using it, you may have found out that ibm wants outrageous prices for parts. i built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest. basically, i have all the standard parts except: motherboard battery power supply i've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask. these are in very limited supply, however. i've basically just cannibalized a couple of old machines. if you are interested, please e-mail me. note: for those who want to convince themselves that they are somehow superior because they have newer and better machines, or who want to inform me that these are "worthless junk," save your effort. i'll just delete the note. those of us who bought these machines when they first came out still find them useful for word processing, etc.. i'm saving mine as a future antique.

while playing around with my gateway 2000 local-bus machine last night, it became apparent that windows 3.1 didn't give the option for 32-bit access for virtual memory. i am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local bus interface. is this expected, or should i be investigating further why no 32-bit option appears? thanks for any help. -- scott linn scott@hpcvccl.cv.hp.com
do you happen to know how i can get a serial mouse (9 pins) working on an ibm l40 notebook (which has a kind of bus mouse connection besides serial and parallel interfaces). the manual doesn't say anything about it. i've tried two drivers, with the result that left and right buttons are recognized, but mouse movement is not. should i cut or shortcut some wires to/from the mouse? thanks for your help. eddy zondag philips research egzondag@prl.philips.nl

(not as good as laser master's demo though). i don't know how many other similar products are out there but i would be surprised if there are several. gordon lang
i am trying to get my system to work with a tandberg 3600 + future domain tmc-1660 + seagate st-21m mfm controller. the system boots up if the tandberg is disconnected from the system, and of course no scsi devices found (i have no other scsi devices). the system boots up if the seagate mfm controller is removed from the system. the future domain card reports finding the tandberg 3660 on the scsi bus. the system then of course stops booting because my mfm hard disks can't be found. the system hangs if all three (tandberg, future domain tmc-1660 & seagate mfm controller) are in the system. looks like there is some conflict between the seagate and future domain card. but the funny thing is that it only hangs if the tandberg is connected. i have checked that there are no conflict in bios addresses, irq & i/o port. have i missed anything? i am lost here. any suggestions are most welcomed. thanks in advance. delman. -- ______________________________________________________________________ delman lee tel.: +1-215-662-6780 medical image processing group, fax.: +1-215-898-9145 university of pennsylvania, 4/f blockley hall, 418 service drive, philadelphia, pa 19104-6021, u.s.a.. internet: delman@mipg.upenn.edu ______________________________________________________________________

we are trying to install a donated hard disk (miniscribe vintage 1988) on a supercheap ancient compaq xt for use in education. the only problem is that the supercheap compaq didn't come with the manual and i haven't been able to figure out how to start the setup program. i began using pcs after 286s were invented, so i have a couple of basic questions: 1. did xt-class computers even *have* setup programs? 2. if they did (or, do), how do i access it? if anybody has any good advice on how to proceed or what to do next or what to look out for, please let me know. e-mail is best, but i'll also be watching the newsgroup postings. thanks in advance, -robert -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- robert luke internet: luke@aero.org the aerospace corporation compuserve: 71155,3011 "danger, will robinson!"

i just purchased a viewsonic 17 and and orchid p9000. in short, i am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card. i have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what i am going to write about. the monitor is pretty. the moires i had under simcity on my 17" magnavox went away. it isn't as heavy as i thought it would be (45 lbs, i think). so much for the monitor. on to the bitch session and test results. in going with the modern trend, the orchid p9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver. of course, this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes (like most of my cd-roms). the compudyne whiplash vga, orchid fahrenheit 1280, and orchid f. vlb all share this limitation. those are all s3 cards, which means it is an s3 problem for them (the p9000 uses a weitek vga chip which also doesn't support them). the hercules graphite card does seem to have these modes, but i didn't run the same test cases as i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it. it was able to print the splash screen for the grolier's encyclopedia, though, which the s3 cards just printed as hash, which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported. the supported resolutions really annoy me. you can do 1280x1024 at 75hz if you tell the driver you have an nec 5fg (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'generic', and if you choose generic you can't get any high refreshes at all). but at 1024x768 you are limited to 70hz. seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!). higher vertical resolution was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f. vlb i currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 hz as well. the higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard. i just got off the phone with orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (i don't know what i have) he was unable to recreate the problem. on the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem. he didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 hz either. the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program. this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second. i don't have the numbers for the graphite card, but they were close to half of the ofvlb (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20mhz 386, isa, so the numbers aren't really comparable. the following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 mhz, air motherboard (umc chipset), with 8 mb memory. i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit. k means thousand (not 1024), m means million, pixels per second orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid p9000 chip s3 805 weitek 9000 dib to screen 182k - 190k 228k - 240k memory to screen 5.9m - 6.2m 8.4m - 8.9m screen to screen 14m - 14.8m 29m - 30.8m vector, solid 2.4m 2.8m - 2.9m vector, styled 55k - 58k 449k - 473k polygon, shaded 1.8m - 2.1m 1.6m - 1.9m polygon, hatched 6.9m - 7.9m 1.3m - 1.7m ternary rops 1.9m - 2.4m 477k - 520k font 130k - 160k 46k - 55k / 1.2m the dib to screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen. i have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go. the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display. the screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen. awesome! interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and ternary rops (whatever they are. graphics operations like xors maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000. i give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because i think they are caching. when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the ofvlb. then the speed increases dramatically. sounds like programming to a benchmark to me.... i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all. its just what i saw when i ran them on my computer. i normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe i'd better. my testing is totally unconnected with my work (i program under unix on decstations) is done completely without the knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company. geoff sherwood
hi, i've got a victor pc/xt with a 20 mb harddisk in it. the controller is a toshiba mfm controller, with an additional 9 pins connector. there are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. one with 9 wires and another with 34 wires. the controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire bus. now i got a 20 mb harddisk from a friend of mine, and i wondered whether i can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus) how can i solve my problem, any suggestions? if you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl). --bas.

hi netters! i'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution. after you read about my situation, i'd like your opinion. here's the scenario: 1. there are two computers in the house. one is a small 286 (40mb ide drive). the other is a 386dx (213 scsi drive w/ adaptec 1522 controller). both systems have pc tools and will use central point backup as the backup / restore program. both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies. 2. the computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon). from what i have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (i'm sure there are others i haven't thought about). for these options, i would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type x won't coexist with device y, etc.) in my thinking (i don't know very much about these beasts): 1. put 2.88mb floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system. can someone supply cost and brand information? what's a good brand? what do the floppies themselves cost? 2. put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my scsi adapter, and continue to back up the 286 with floppies. again, can someone recommend a few manufacturers? the only brand i remember is colorado memories. any happy or unhappy users (i know about the compression controversy)? 3. connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my scsi adapter, and (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?) 4. install a floptical drive in each machine. again, any gotcha's or recommendations for manufacturers? i appreciate your help. you may either post or send me e-mail. i will summarize all responses for the net. thanks, george =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= george j. pandelios				internet: gjp@sei.cmu.edu software engineering institute		usenet:	 sei!gjp 4500 fifth avenue				voice:	 (412) 268-7186 pittsburgh, pa 15213				fax:	 (412) 268-5758 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= disclaimer: these opinions are my own and do not reflect those of the 	 software engineering institute, its sponsors, customers, 	 clients, affiliates, or carnegie mellon university. in fact, 	 any resemblence of these opinions to any individual, living 	 or dead, fictional or real, is purely coincidental. so there. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

i have the pas16 / toshiba 3401 combo and have no problems with it.
about two months ago i purchased the adaptec asw-410 driver for use with a cd-rom drive. at the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation i had with my adaptec scsi controller said that this is the driver to be used with cd-rom drives. since then i have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (i think it's called ezi-scsi or something). i wasn't too fussed about this until i upgraded by cd-rom drive from a sony cdu-541 to a sony cdu-641. i now find that the audio-mode will not work. i assume it is not being handled correctly by the asw-410 driver. so, should i chase adaptec for an upgrade? if so does anyone know their fax number? any assistance appreciated. regards btw: everything else works fine, certainly seems that sony have caught up with the rest with the 641. -- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< nigel harwood >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> << post: coles supermarkets, po box 480 glen iris 3146, australia >> << phone: +61 3 829 6090 e-mail: nigel@cnw01.storesys.coles.oz.au >> << fax: +61 3 829 6886 >>

recently my cousin got a second internal ide drive (a seagate 210mb, i can look up the model number if it's important) and i've been trying to help him install it. [i've got a vested interest, since my machine's busted and i have to use his until i get mine fixed.] he already has a seagate 85mb ide hd (again, i forget the model number but i can find out.) anyway, i can't seem to get the bloody thing up. i've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever i try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test. the ide controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; i think i've configured the cmos correctly; the power's plugged in properly; i even learned about the master/slave relationship that two hds are supposed to have (didn't know pcs were into s&m! 8^) and i think i configured the jumpers properly (the 85mb one is the master, the new 210mb one is the slave). the only thing i can think of is maybe i'm doing the cabling wrong. i've tried several combinations: controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave none of them worked. unfortunately, i can't think of any others. another possibility is that the 85mb one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, c and d, and the cmos asks for "c: drive" and "d: drive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most others i've seen. could this be confusing things? so, i need help! the drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the cmos setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; i cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now i be lost! many, many thanks in advance! this is practically an emergency (i have two papers to do on this thing for monday!)! help! -- ----------------------- william barnes		suranet operations wbarnes@sura.net	(301) 982-4600 voice (301) 982-4605 fax disclaimer: i don't speak for suranet and they don't speak for me.

hi. recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up. previously, when i first start up my pc i can see all the cmos messages (ram test ...etc) but now i've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash. this only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). if it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again, the display works as normal like before. does anyone know what is causing this? is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old). i've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet. i'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. thanks a lot. edwin -- ----------------------------------------------------- * edwin ng (edwin@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz) * * e&e engineering, university of auckland * * private bag 92019, auckland, new zealand *

i am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any real reviews of them. one of the cards the local stores are pushing is the genoa 8500 for $125-140. apparently it uses a cirrus logic acc. chip, but i don't know which one (gd5426?). one of the shops i've spoken with claims the card out-performs the diamond stealth 24 vl and the orchid fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (s3 86c805 based), but that can't be true if it is using the gd5426. i like the price of the genoa 8500, but if it lags in performance behind the s3 cards, i'll pay the extra $50 for one of them. any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. if i get replies via email, i'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested. thanks in advance, brian oppy (bjoppy@ucdavis.edu)

(at least that's how it looks from a software point of view). it was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms. is there any argument that ide can (or can't) transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data? are scsi versions of ide drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface (because of a higher rpm platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)? >: given the original question (scsi used only as a single hard drive >: controller), is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do >: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the scsi choice to make any sence? >: what does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec scsi drive cost? > >no, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking os, scsi can use both drives >at once. i've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time. it's pretty ugly. if data is going from one drive to another, and if scsi has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the cpu or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it. as far as i know, ide can't do that. but when the cpu wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time? working off 1 irq and 1 dma channel on an isa (or whatever) bus? >i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home. i paid $369 for it. i >haven't seen ide drives cheaper. a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for $320.

(and how common were scsi drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?) there's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice. >: i won't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good, well implimented >: data highway, but i still want to know why it intrinsically better >: (than ide, on an isa bus) when it comes to multi-tasking os's when >: managing data from a single scsi hard drive. > >on a single drive, scsi is more expensive. but on that point, is it faster? this is what all this is about. do you get more performance for the money. for all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the os) will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide? >but, you bought your pc for >expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever. true, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards. >	1. you can add many different types of devices and access them >	concurrently. no argument. this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the best reason. but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire? again does it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system? >	2. a scsi device works on many different machines (i have a mac >	and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice >	with scsi -- hook them up and away they go) with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs, are you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible? and even if they are, is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?) is it really plug'n'play? >	3. scsi devices work together better than ide devices. for >	instance, recently, i added an older connor 100 meg ide to a maxtor >	212 meg ide. the connor *must* be setup as the slave. it will >	work no other way. on scsi, you set the address, check the >	termination, plug it in, and away it goes. so the c: drive on the connor becomes a logical d: drive to dos. is this really a problem? >	4. i have a problem with ide's mutual exclusion - i notice that >	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is >	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: >	to d: on a scsi system. under a multitasking os, this is very >	noticable, as many things can be going on at once. after having two ide drives in my system for temporary file transfers, i have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive. >one neat thing that i've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the >ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a scsi system with >little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i've >added to my pc. i've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to >have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive >all on the same card. that is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up). i do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 ide drives on a pc. >simply put, scsi is handier than ide. no mysterious jumpers to figure out. but what about "mysterious" (and expensive) drivers to figure out? at least ide doesn't require drivers that consume precious conventional (dos) memory.

we are trying to connect an olivetti xm4311 5" floppy drive as the second drive on a panasonic 286 machine. it seems to sort of talk to it (gets it spinning and stepping) but gives a "disk not ready" error. there are two jumpers (which seem to work best open), a 3 position dip switch, and a 8 position dip switch. we don't know how to set the dip switches and think that may be the problem. any information, or advice (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be most appreciated, thanks.

i'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and could use some feedback on a couple systems i'm looking at if anyone is familiar with them. the system that looks the most interesting is the budget 486/66 vlb tower. for about $2343 (delivered) it offers vlb, 8mb, 200mb ide, a mitsumi cd-rom (with software bundle), media vision sound board, 14" ctx 1468ni, 128k cache, and the usual drives, ports, & os software. since my budget is $2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it is too good to be true, of course). among other things, i've never seen a review of the budget systems (or their parent company, micro smart), or of the motherboard they are using (the aetana). any feedback would be appreciated. in a similar vein, the second system i'm considering midwest micro's elite vesa 486/66 tower with a diamond viper (2mb) & midwest micro 14" mi monitor is one i've never seen reviewed anywhere. i'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well. any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. 	email response would be greatly appreciated. 	thanks, -- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. his own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. john stuart mill -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- rick adams -=*=- adamsr@ais.org -=*=- adamsr@norwich.bitnet anonymous users may send to ap-poly.491@n7kbt.rain.com

today i recieved a in-warranty replacement for my diamond speedstar 24x. on the card i've noticed a few changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled jp5. (the card is revision 5a) my detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the bale line on the 64-pin part of the isa bus. the question i have is simple: to those people who own this revision of the speedstar 24x, what does the manual claim that this jumper does? to anyone with an isa-reference, what is the function of the bale line? on a related note: are there any ftp sites which contain a descriptive reference to the isa bus? my motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name chart, but that is it. -douglas _________________________________________________________ ________ ___ ___ |_ __ \ | | | | douglas r. pokorny | |__| / | | | | drp@camelot.bradley.edu | __ \ | | | | cs major/geisert hall resident _| |__| | | \__/ | |________/ \______/ "conveniently located in the bradley university armpit of illinois... peoria"

hello, i already tried our national news group without success. i tried to replace a friend's original ibm floppy disk in his ps/1-pc with a normal teac drive. i already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5v) and 6 (12v), shorted pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2k2) on pins 8, 26, 28, 30, and 34. the computer doesn't complain about a missing fd, but the fd's light stays on all the time. the drive spins up o.k. when i insert a disk, but i can't access it. the teac works fine in a normal pc. are there any points i missed? thank you. 	volkmar --- volkmar.grote@stollmann.de

(ie 512 + 512 or 640 +0k) ?? 3) can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (yeah i know its a piece of cake.. i'm lazy 8) 4) software wise.. anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded ram on a pc (from a program written in turbo c++).... for instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640k regardless of combinations of emm386 etc etc... what i want is to be able to use the ram above and beyond the 1mb boundary... i'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but i'll suspect not .. 5) also.. what half brained wit created dos so as not to be re-entrant?????? as a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of dos calls 0 to 0c from within a dos interrupt? ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. two articles i've read on the subject have given conflicting views... does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability? many thanks.. gotta go, bars closing soon 8) cheers ian 	
fellow netters, i'm in the market for a hand scanner. however, i don't know anyone who has one. i have my eye on two choices. dexxa: this scanner is available at wal-mart for $90. it includes grayworks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (i think). the ocr software catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also. mustek: (gray artist for windows) this scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to cad & graphics) and 800 dpi. it is available for $169 mail-order and comes with perceive ocr and picture publisher le. i am also looking at a genius hand scanner (b105) from cad & graphics. it is basically the same as the mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149). basically, i would like recommendations on which to buy. i have heard that logitech makes the best and manufactures dexxa scanners. but which one is the best buy? would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than hp laserjet iii or canon bj-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)? i am leaning toward the mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices. which should i buy? if you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it. also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please e-mail me. any and all help would be greatly appreciated. - kevin harter

greetings, please forgive me if this is faq. if there is source on this kind of info, please let me know. i just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension), and i am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386. the station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big case. i have sony 1304 monitor, syquest drive (mac), and maybe a cd-rom reader (mac) for it. here are the questions i have so far: 1) is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that i could use the case? 2) the original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. can i use them to control these devices under 486? how much do i have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) how can i make syquest (scsi) and cd-rom (scsi) work on this station? i heard that there is a cheap sound board that has scsi controller built-in? what's quality of this board? how much usually does a scsi control cost? is there any ftp sites that has syquest driver or cd-rom driver for the pc if i can have everything hooked up ok?4) what i want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a mpc- quality station. how much would it cost to do that? is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? btw, i need to buy a keyboard for it too. any input is welcome. thank you. peter liu

facts: ===== - a netware server 286a was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - from memory it has an 80 mb hard drive. - manuals and original disks are for sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a - when powered up, the cmos was wiped. a technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable. my investigations indicate that drive c is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). when cmos set this way, compsurf runs happily, with 13 bad blocks. i use prepare to hotfix the one internal drive. install will proceed "successfully", but when i try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware. internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit). attempts to configure a second drive in cmos result in drive not ready errors. questions: ========= the software is netware 286 level ii and i can see burnt on to the screen sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a. however, to configure netware for level ii (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? so how is the novell server 286a normally configured? 1. can i install sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a as level i, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. is the novell server 286a normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. would this mean i can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. what else can cause a serialisation error? 5. what happens if the keycard fails? 6. am i doing something wrong? can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides. thanks for your time. apology: ======= i appreciate that i have posted this request somewhat widely. as i'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software i'm hoping that by casting my net further, i'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before. i believe i can justify the groups to which i am posting. please feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post this. -- 	this posting is definitive. bljeghbe'chugh vaj blhegh. wayne mcdougall :: keeper of the list of shows better than star trek(tm) :: ask me about the auckland festival of missions, 18-25 april, 1993 i always change my mind when new evidence is available. what method do you use?

>how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bus? by initiating a dma xfer. :) seriously, busmastering adapter have their own dma ability, they don't use the motherboards on-board dma(which is *much* slower). isa has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 isa system try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or crash.(i forget) their are 8 dma channels in an isa system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit. the system uses dma 0, a soundblaster uses dma 1. i could buy a busmastering xga-2 video card & a busmastering scsi ha. in order for them to work properly, i would have to find out what dma channel the xga-2 card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to use a different dma channel for its dma xfers. i don't know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa. i'm not sure if they can on eisa systems either. i do know that on eisa/mca systems, you can allow bm cards to use the same dma channel. thanks.
they don't have a conflict because technically lpt1: does not use irq7!. the parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as irq7, then onto the main processor as int 0x0f. by default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no int 0x0f's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual irq7. note, this applies to com ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although com's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring com port activity easier than polling the serial uart, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!. windows may be a different story....
hi, i just got a problem, i have a cheapo 2400bps modem which i use to connect to my university, but i get too much garbage on the screen. i do know it's because the noise in the line (i can actually hear it). so my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage?, my modem doesn't have any of these on hardware, can a software implemented protocol do the trick? thanks. juan carlos leon -- jleon@scf.usc.edu | jcleon@ucs.usc.edu electrical & computer major | university computing services 		university of southern california 			los angeles, ca.

the jp5 on the speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems. if your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper block from jp5. this will not affect the proformance of the speedstar 24x. this is what my manual says about jp5. i never knew that it was there but the card is a real ask kicker in my book. it beats the hell out of my junk sony 1604s to the point that i can't even use above 648x480 mode much...sam some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a sony with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. or installing 60ns simms and then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought! -- gosh..i think i just installed a virus..it was called ms dos6... don't copy that floppy..burn it...i just love windows...crash...

hai, in a few days i'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses). it comes with a cirrus logic vlb card which has 2mb ram onboard. it can do true-color but i don't know what type of card it is. i read that cirrus logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around. my old system had a tseng 4000. i was pretty pleased with it, so i consider buying a w32/tseng card. i'd like to know a few things: 	- how is the speed/performance in dos/windows/unix/os/2 	 graphics & text (also compared to s3 cards for example) 	- what resolutions (including no. of colors) does it 	 support (text & graphics) 	- how many ram can be installed and what type of ram 	- compatibility with old tseng 4000 	- support in software if anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) i'd like to know. if you have a better alternative than the w32 please tell me about it. for the people in holland: kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de w32 in nederland te verkrijg is? het liefst in de omgeving van amsterdam! thanks in advance,			erik stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)

hi all, i would like to purchase cd-rom drive. the specs i would like to have is: * applicable to kodak multisession photo-cd * scsi(2) interface * compatible with adaptec-1542b * does not need any caddies * cheaper ( < $500 if possible) * double speeded i believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition, so i would like to know all of your opinion. the above conditions are sorted by my priority. i think nec cdr74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it does satisfy almost all of the above conditions. the problem is that i do not know the compatibility with 1542b. has someone succeeded to connect these nec drives to 1542b? i have heard a rumor that nec drive is incompatible with 1542b adapter. any suggestions are greatly appreciated. thanks in advance, kobayashi,masaoki (masaoki@tky.hp.com)

hi! i think vga-copy can do what you need. if you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on the "modify" switch of vga-copy. when you boot using this diskette, a message appears: this is no system disk, you can 1) replace disk with another, 2) boot from harddisk or 3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:) type your choice: when you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: . seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks in 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (i have only a 3.5" a: drive) hope that helps robert p.s.: vga-copy is shareware, so it's easy to get. newest version seems to be 5.0 . -- +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | robert fuhge, haagstrasse 17, 8520 erlangen, tel. privat: 09131/204103 | | email: rtfuhge@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de (demnaechst 91054 erlangen) | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | "wars are not for to see who is right, but who is left ...

i am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his dtk i/o plus ii card working and it does not want to cooperate. the documentation is no help at all. as an example, it says 'the serial port can be changed to com2 from com1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-( there are 2 banks of jumpers. the first one is labeled as follows: c1 c2 s2 p2 p1 g the second bank is labeled "irq" and has the following labels: 5c 5s 4 3 3s 2c 2s i have determined that the c1 & c2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as com1 or com2. the p1,p2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as lpt1 or lpt2. i am guessing that the "g" enables the game port and the "s2" should enable the second serial port, but i can't get it to work. i have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success. i assume that this bank must tell the card which irq's to use for both ports, but i don;t know how. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! ebd -- elliot dierksen "is that a real poncho... i mean is that a mexican poncho or is that a sears poncho? hmmm... no foolin'..." -- f. zappa w) e.dierksen@att.com (407) 660-3377 h) elliot@alfred.uucp (407) 290-9744

i have just a few quick questions. does anyone here have a 486 dlc system? (a cyrix 486 dx) any problems with it? second, how much should a cyric 486dlc-33 motherboard (with no ram) run me? 3rd...should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it beyond hope? 4th...i hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may be). is there any truth to this? any replies would be greatly appreciated.

help! i really got ripped off and i need some help unripping myself. i bought a maxtor 4380 300mb esdi hdd from hi-tech for $300, then paid to get it repaired, for about another $300. here's the deal: the thing works fine! it low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all! and then... (jaws music) sectors start going bad! eek!!! one at a time. norton disk doctor keeps marking some u and some c. that fixes it. for about 5 minutes. then next day when i run ndd on it again: no dice more uncorrectable and correctable sectors. ahhhhhuuuurrrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!! so i fugure: "ok, ndd's just not being thurough enough, i'll use spinrite, i heard that works well." what happens? spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!! ahhhuuuurrrrrrggggghhhh!!!! ndd undoes it of course. the problem seams to be getting worse and worse. however when the hdd is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so. i'm so pissed off right now i'm considering buying another hdd, and i really can't afford it. i'm using smartdrive, and windows 3.1 (i'm not using the 32 bit disk access though, i know that can create problems). the disk is using the second option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls, and everything else selected is standard, maybe i need to use a different head skew or something? i don't know. anyone who knows how to fix this problem please tell me how!!!! help!!!! -- gt: "designing tommorow the night before with yesterday's technology."
i have a 386/40 motherboard with ami bios. i haven't located the little motherboard manual yet, and suddenly it's giving me 10 beeps when i turn the power on. it was working fine this morning, then gave all kinds of problems, in windows and outside it. after multiple reboots, now it only gives 10 beeps and sits there? anybody know what 10 beeps means? thanks.
well, i was told that my last message came through without anything in it, so i'll try again. i have a leading edge 386sx 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend game me one to replace it, but he didn't have any docs for the mother board. it's a cheertron board with award bios and has a sticker on it that says vi 1 t1 3 t2 3 on it. i can tell what most of the switches on the blue blocks mean. except fdc and sh, but i have no idea about all the jumpers. i've replaced hard drives and modems and installed math co-processes, but this is a bit out of my league and without the docs, i'm really lost. if anyone could give me some help on this, i'd really appreciate it. i don't get on news regularly, so if you can help, please e-mail me at passman@world.std.com thanks. -- shirl

does your stealth 24 have a row of dip switches on the back plane? if so, you have the older revision a board and the winmark results are absolutely normal. the later revision b board benchmarks at 13 to 15 million winmarks (at least mine does in 486dx-50 toy). v
anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail quickly ;). there is a pair of jumpers on one side, and a set of 3 or 4 on the other end. one is labeled, sync , and one cd, and e0 e1 e2. whhich do i need to short, or disconnect to get drive to operate in slave mode? give me a label or "geographic label, as they have quite a few jumpers, and i don't wanna try the trial and error method... i am using ide. i think this drive is scsi compatible too. jimmy jimmyhua@usc.edu
okay, i'm trying to install ncsa telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch) of machines. they're all true blue ibms with either fallon phonenet cards or dastar cards. (i belive those names are correct.) well, the docs for telnet say that it'll run over an appletalk driver, but i've had little success. if anyone has succesfully installed telnet w/ appletalk, i'd like some help with the config file for telnet... btw, please reply via e-mail if possible... thanks, jeremy -- jeremy zawodny | computer science undergrad | bowling green state university ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ jzawodn@andy.bgsu.edu | student computer consultant | *thrilled* os/2 2.0 user

(my calculations show 3121kb/sec maximum and 1578kb/sec minimum... disk spins at 4306 rpm with 87 sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside) "single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected 'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance." (i take this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck) "for page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer ram is up to 10.0 mb/s. this high transfer rate allows the at interface ic to communicate over the at bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 mb/s, while the dcs simultaneously controls disk-to-ram transfers" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ so the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch while it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64kb read buffers for pre-fetching, i guess you could call that a cache :-|). so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks, why am i getting a measly 862kb/sec when i should be getting around 3mb/sec??? any of you hard-disk engineers out there know? wondering why my disks are so slow, david o o --------------------ooo-(_)-ooo-------------------------------------------- david stam linux: the choice of a gnu generation stam@netcom.com 386-un*x-x11r5-openlook-gcc-tex-free!

b(>i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding b(>extended operation of my g2k 486-33v with the cover removed b(>from the enclosure. there are a # of reasons i am considering b(>this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card b(>setups. b(>my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the b(>cooling flow of air from the fan, "hot spots" may develop on my b(>motherboard or elsewhere. if you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most offices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (i'm talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots uncovered.) however, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with is rf sheilding. operating a system without the full cover may create problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's tv or ham radio station - very much a no-no in the eyes of the law. * slmr 2.1a * remember - they're only tools, not a way of life! -- via dlgqwk v0.71a

i know of two people who have horrer stories about the dos 6.0. that's 100% of the people i know with dos 6.0. both have had to reformat their disks and start over. one had drive d compress and work fine, only to compress c: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligable warning, and then hang. all that was left on either drive was autoexec.bat and config.sys. calls to microsoft only met with busy signals. after reformatting the drive, i'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known entity. the other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed, he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall. i make now claims since i was not driving at the time, however, be careful and make sure you back important things up. i am interested in any other people with similar or success stories.....

i have a gateway 4dx-33v with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive a. i accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular box of diskettets in the a drive when i boot up, rather than getting the "non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the cmos gets overwritten (luckily, gateway sends a print of the standard cmos settings with their systems). this only happens with a box of pre-formatted fuji disks that i have, no other disks cause this problem. if i re-format one of the fuji disks, the problem goes away. i did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing. anyone have any idea what is going on here? hardware problem? a virus that can't be detected? the system reading in garbage from the boot sector? -- tim king, tcking@uswnvg.com

hi, i'm currently in the process of writing a number of pd programs for the sound blaster. the first of which is a cmf voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as i can get it to an ftp site). anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the fm synth remotely. the problem is that i have little or no info on the sb midi port. i have tried using the sound blaster freedom project routines, however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data byte. i am using turbo c and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. when i was in berlin this summer i saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my german is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me. my second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file format be standard if you keep it secret ?) i need to know the file format for instrument bank files *.bnk and roland music files *.rol. finally does anyone have a source for displaying pcx or gif files to ega or vga monitors. please help, you know it makes sense. colin

hi netters, as promised, here are the summary of opinions on doubledisk gold v.6.0. people seem to be quite happy with the product. there is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader stacker 3.0. (superstor pro is not considered since it is slower than stacker although just as reliable - byte magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make any decision to go with stacker or with doubledisk gold v6.0. however, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy. buddy christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- hello buddy, i do not have dd gold 6.0 experience. i just ordered it. i currently have dd 2.3 (the last version). i am very pleased with its performance. here is my suggestion... 1) if you do not have any compression software currently, i would go with 	dos 6.0's compression. all the discussion on the net indicates that 	for $50 you get the compression (built into the os), plus the other 	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for. besides, you 	are now at dos6.0 (whatever that means...) 2) if you have doubledisk 2.3 already (like i do), the cost is $29.95 	for the upgrade. after thinking about it and asking the net, i 	decided that i could not go wrong with the update cost! 	i have never suffered from performance of dd. i have a 12ms hd with 	large sw packages in both compressed and uncompressed format. it 	works great. not delays. i think the "a" is better than "b" 	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. 	i am looking forward to being able to "loadhigh" the dd sw. that 	has been an annoyance. 3) if you have stacker, et.al. currently, i would not see it worth the 	effort to upgrade. just my $.02 ... regards, mark bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- buddy, i got the same mailer. about 2 weeks ago i got ddg and installed it. the documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. i used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly. there were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & qemm. ddg has an uninstall (unlike dos6.0) if you need it. my system has a 203mb hard drive. before installing ddg i had ~5mb free. after ddg i had ~197mb free. pretty good statistics considering that my 8mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such). i have had no problems whatsoever. i have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. so far i am a very happy camper. -bruce -- bruce f. steinke | "never know when you're going to bsteinke@dsd.es.com | need a good piece of rope." software technical support engineer | sam gamgee evans & sutherland computer corp. | <my mail, my opinions> --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	i have been using doubledisk gold for a little more than a month on a 486dx 33mhz, 120mb seagate drive, running dos & windows in 386 enhanced mode. 	i ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a doubledisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. 	i have no complaints about reliability. it was very easy to install. the only problem i had was with castle wolfenstein 3-d. i assumed the game was trying to bypass dos disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk. since then the game has never given me a problem. there was never any damage to the doubledisk drive. 	compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1. this is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files. if you have any more specific questions let me know. dan --------------------------------------------------------------------------- i bought it an have been happy with it. i use it on both mfm and ide 40 mb drives. i was using doubledisk before gold came out. that is the same product msdos 6.0 is shipping with. no problems with either product. -- ron bjornseth bjornset@pogo.den.mmc.com /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -------------------- end of messages --------------------------------------

hey folks. is it possible to short out your cmos chip? i think mine is fried. these are the symptoms... i have to do the following to get my computer (a gateway 486dx33) to boot... turn the power off disconnect the battery to the cmos chip turn the power on get into setup upon getting the cmos configuration error set up the cmos exit the setup with [f10] (phoenix bios) ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [f1] the computer then boots normally. both hard drives are accessible but the floppy drives are not. i can back up over the network and such, but if i need to reboot, i have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above. if i simply <ctl>-<alt>-<del>, the computer hangs after the memory test. does this sound like the cmos chip is fried? can i buy another one? where? thank you for your kind attention. john -- john c. lusth, becton dickinson research center, rtp, nc, usa jcl@bdrc.bd.com
for those of you who might be familiar with insight distribution network, inc. and their multimedia kits: i'm seriously considering buying the insight talon ta-2000 mm kit, which is bundled with the cd-rom drive with 265-280ms access time, 300kb dtr, multispin, multi-session photo cd capability, etc., and with the pas-16 sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with insight, you know the kit i mean). i believe the drive is either a texel (265ms) or an nec (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of oem!). other questions: - excuse my ignorance, but is "texel" a reputable maker in the cd-rom market? or do you think nec is the better drive? - bottom line: is this kit worth the money? (currently, $449 for the ta-1000, and $699 for the ta-2000) alternatively, i was thinking that the ta-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, i *do* want full multimedia capabilities, photo cd stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end ta-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit. basically, i would just like to hear from those who have actually used these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably directly to the email address below. thanks, koji 2 _/ ~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | _/ _/ | koji kodama | | by _/ _/ | nippon motorola ltd. | | _/ _/ | ryvg90@email.sps.mot.com | | _/ _/ |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| | _/_/ _/ | note: the opinions expressed herein | | _/ _/ | are mine, and do not reflect the opinions | | _/ _/ |or policies of motorola inc. or its affiliates.| ~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ _/_/_/

i just installed a dx2-66 cpu in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a cpu cooler on the chip. after about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough to dislodge the cpu from its mount. it ended up bending a few pins on the cpu, but luckily the power was not on yet. i ended up pressing the cpu deeply into its socket and then putting the cpu cooler back on. so far so good. have others had this problem? how do you ensure that the weight of the cpu fan and heatsink do not eventually work the cpu out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case? -- will estes		internet: westes@netcom.com

i have had a zeos for a couple months. while the experience was not painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7 people i personally know) who have ordered gateways. (of course, several of the gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent out...b{) i got the 1 mb viper card. the first one was defective, but zeos replaced it with only minor hassles. this one works fine. i haven't noticed any problems in any of my applications. i also ordered it because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago. guess you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average stuff.... for my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no monitor, viper, etc.) the zeos was slightly cheaper than gateway, austin, etc. but this can change from month to month. mike

hi there. we just bought a 486 dx2/66 gateway system with a 2 meg ati ultra pro video card. everything seems to work fine except for the windows drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes. the fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible. naturally, i called gateway tech support to inquire about this. the technician asked me about the drivers, and i told him it was version 1.5, build 59. he told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ati ultra pro simply do not work!!! is this true? if so, i'm simply amazed. how could this be? the strange thing is i would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the faq!!!). one very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the windows accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for windows 3.1. i easily challenged him on that because i've been running a diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and i have tested and used the 24 bit mode as well. he then backed off and said: "well, diamond has been working on those drivers much longer." anyway, i just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it. any feedback will be appreciated. the system configuration is: gateway 486 dx2/66 local bus 16 megs ram scsi hd & cd-rom ultrastor 34f local bus scsi controller ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram dos 6.0 windows 3.1 mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59) thanks in advance. -- ali r. vali - reza@magellan.ae.utexas.edu

experiences with diamond viper vlb video card several problems: 1) the ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1mb of vram, which is what i have. this color depth is not supported with video bios version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. a max of 65k colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1mb vram. 2) with the 65k color choice i notice two minor irritations: a) under ndw, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to be. b) with word for windows, when you use shading in a table, the display shows the inverse of the shading; for example, if you shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is ok). 3) the big killer bug is using the borland c++ integrated development environment. the problem occurs when you click on the turbo debugger icon (or use the debugger option in the run command), and the debugger application goes to vga character mode (as it is designed to do). the screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. the turbo debugger display is all garbled. through trial and error, i have found that when the disrupted screen is displayed you should do [alt-spacebar] followed by the letter "r". this instructs turbo debugger to refresh the screen, and it does this satisfactorily. i wish i didn't have to do this. the bug is more than with the diamond drivers. the same disruptive behavior happens with the standard vga driver that comes with windows. there must be something in the video card that mishandles the vga mode. the problem is not my monitor. the same bug shows up when i use another monitor in place of my usual one. i still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). --- swh, 20apr93

i need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin. i'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for. anyway, here's description of the card: it is a 16-bit card, although i noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything. it has 4 ns16550an chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled com1 - com4. there is also an external female connector with 37 pins. there are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers. i believe that i have determined, by following traces, that sw5 and sw6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the com ports. sw5[1-4] are for irq3, sw5[5-8] are for irq4, and sw6[1-4] are for irq5. the other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. 	 the only identification printed on the board is "multi serial port board" across the bottom. there is a box for serial number, but it is blank. immediately below the words "serial no", but not in the box left for the s/n, are the numbers "1990 2 8". anyone have any clues? your help is greatly appreciated. -- dwayne@stratsft.uucp + "we have ways to make you scream." dwayne bailey + -- intel advertisement, strategic software + in the june 1989 doctor dobbs journal redford, michigan +
i just bought an actix graphics engine 32 plus with 2 megs. i am not impressed... i have been having all sorts of problems with the board. various lock-ups in windows, problems with the screen not centering, no flexibilty in choosing synch rates for a monitor, buggy windows drivers, lack of 1024x768x64k driver, if anyone else has one of these cards, please e-mail me... looks like i'm going to try the ati ultra plus... -- **************************************************************************** brad@bach.udel.edu brad cain 			 n3naf cain@snow-white.ee.udel.edu university of delaware electrical engineering cain@freezer.cns.udel.edu "blah, blah, blah" alt.blah

hi. i am trying to set up a conner 3184 and a quantum 80at drive. i have the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work the other way around). i am able to access both drives if i boot from a floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves. i am running msdos 6, and have the conner partitioned as primary dos, and is formatted with system files. i have tried all different types of setups, and even changed ide controller cards. if i boot from a floppy, everything works great (except the booting part :)). the system doesn't report an error message or anything, just hangs there. does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else run into a similar problem? i was thinking that i might have to update the bios on one of the drives (is this possible?). any suggestions/answers would be greatly appreciated. please reply to: 	jason badry 	badry@cs.ualberta.ca

is it possible to buy a serial i/o card with the 16550 uart's built in (rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)? my current i/o card uses 8250's (correct number? the braindead ones anyway). it also controls two floppy drives, and two ide hard drives. ideally, i'd like to get a new multi i/o card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 ide hd's. it would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the ide controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card. does such a beast exist? now the hard part - where can i get one in australia, preferably brisbane? thanks, geoff green (spart@cs.uq.oz.au)

single/dual drive and led operation on the drive need to be set as described in the relevant product specification. i a single drive environment the drive is described as a master. in a dual drive environment the drives are described as a master and a slave. this is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. there are four links, lk1, lk2, lk4 and lk5, adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. they have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. lk2: led when fitted, this jumper connects the led drive to pin 39 of the interface. this allows a led to be connected to the interface. an external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the led when this option is selected. the value of the resistor will be dependant on the led type chosen but will be in the range of 130 ohms ot 220 ohms. lk1: dual drives this jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. it fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector, indicating, to the master drive, the presence of a slave. lk4: master when fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a master. if there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. lk5: iochrdy when fitted this connects the iochrdy signal to the drive, it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 mbytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. this jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 mbytes per second. there are four possible master/slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: master, single drive with led on interface		lk2 & lk4 fitted. master, single drive without led on interface	lk4 only fitted. master, dual drive without led on interface	lk4 & lk1 fitted. slave, dual drive without led on interface		no jumpers fitted. master, dual drive with led on interface		lk4, lk1 & lk2 fitted. slave, dual drive with led on interface		lk2 only fitted. the master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. the other connections for a led will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. this led driver is not affected by the link options. an internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this led driver. refer to the product specification for further details. *************************** s e a g a t e ************************* there is a list of most seagate hd (including mfm, scsi, esdiand ide) on every simtel mirror under

i recently bought an amd 386/40. the motherboard booklet says the board is a "391 wb/h." i have 4 1x3 simms on board. the machine also uses a super ide i/o card (model pt-604). (of course niether the motherboard or the i/o card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are) i'm also using a trident 8900c svga card. 	anyway, that's all of the pertinent info i can think of. my problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "parity error -- system halted" messages depending on whether i set the memory parity error checking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense). its ami bios (so it must be an ami board?). 	i just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the simms but i keep getting the same error (more frequently now). it all worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till i got home (figures). 	i've tried to take out all of the simms and even re-inserted them in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid. 	my suspicion jumps to this damn all in one hd controller/serial/ parallel/game-port i/o card, or to the motherboard (god forbid). 	can anyone help? thanks, peace, david geller gelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu

hello, i'am almost ashame to ask this question. it really looks like a faq, but couldn't find the answer. anyway... the original ibm-pc/xt 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best keyboard around. function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click, etc. is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 at clone? i do understand that the new at keyboard has more functionality. i.e. the typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. it seams to me that the pins & electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. maybe the communication protocol is different? please answer by e-mail. also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible. in that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology. thanks, duco -- duco fijma tel. x31-53-893718 university of twente fax. x31-53-893811 p.o. box 217 internet: fijma@cs.utwente.nl 7500 ae enschede the netherlands | no ugly pictures in this sig! |

a few weeks ago i saw an ad in the german magazine c't about a so-called videostreamer. this is an interface between a pc's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. the company (datasave?) claims that it can store up to 7 gb on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ it costs dm 250.- (about usd 200, i think) my question is: does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes really fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 gb sounds quite unbelievable to me). however, any comments on the interface are appreciated. please mail your replies directly to me, i will sum up if neccesary. thanks in advance... -gerhard (gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at)

i have a 486/50mhz isa board with 256kbyte cache and 16 megs ram. i just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. the sb16 uses 16bit dma channel.i could select between channel 5 to 7. it is the first card i ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. after i tested the card the first time, the computer crashed and i got a parity error-system halted. this happens either from dos as also from windows. so it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? i eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow! thanks for your help. yours markus
	hi everyone, 	i have a question regarding my stack on my pc. i am programming in turbo c 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too). i keep getting errors that i am running out of memory after a while of running the program. when i compile the program, it says i have 4.45 meg of ram so i can't seem to explain why it crashes. all it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. this leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing. does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything?? 	i have been working on this problem for days and i would really appreciate any responce. if this is not the correct newsgroup, i will gladly re-post, but this is the only i could find. thanks in advance, sean mars email mars@carroll1.cc.edu carroll college waukesha, wi
you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error checking enabled or disabled. i assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled. how high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs? does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps? the error could be occuring in cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms. the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either. boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board. i tend to doubt your problem is with your ide controller, also. anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better. mrb boltz@vivaldi.psu.edu mrb118@psuvm.psu.edu

i used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem. what was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line. this is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local electronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the outside five or six times. this is a easy and cheap fix that does not have the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem. talk to yah later. mark. mark.zander@sheridanc.on.ca

(in case it's important, the network card is an smc arcnet 8-bit compatable card. it's i/o address is 02e0 and it's ram base address is d000. it's also using irq 2) i believe there is a file on the diamond bboard that explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, i don't know the bboard number. if you can, please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) send me the diamond bbs number b ) e-mail (or post) the dip switch settings for the card (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) tell me what i'm doing wrong, so i can magicly get everything working. any help at all would be much appreciated. thanks in advance, red/.

i have a 386dx clone, with a dtc esdi controller and toshiba 660 mbyte drive. since installing dos 6.0, when i tried to re-install software from 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when i mount the second..third..fourth disks, dos 6 doesn't recognize that i have changed floppies. if i do a "dir", i see the contents of the previous diskette. the only way to get dos to recognize that diskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them. buying dos 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. dos 5.0 was stable, and worked well with my equipment. i have superstor pro, and desqview/x ( with qemm, manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of dos 6 that i am using. i guess i should roll back to dos 5.0 but i am wary of what will happen when i do it. besides, like a fool, i don't have a dos 5. bootable disk anymore. i've made the same mistakes i caution my users not to make. like sheep, i joined the crowd flocking to dos 6. baaa baaad system administrator. phillip culver silicon graphics inc mtn. view, ca

i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one i already had. my problem is this. my system only had a ide cable for one drive, so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it, and consequently have to switch cables. the problem is, the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the ide card. but for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these. secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives. does it matter which i plug into the "master" drive and which into the "slave"? any help appreciated. thanks...

(for completeness, the cts is an input to the dte and an output from the dce). the other two signals (of interest) are ring indicator (ri) and data carrier detect (dcd). these are both inputs to the dte and outputs from the dce. ri is just what you would expect - a signal to the dte saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the dce. this is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. dcd is a way for the dce to announce that the "connection" has been established i.e. the local dce is talking to some remote dce. there - that's it. oh there are many other rs-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete. i have explained the nine signals that are on a pc. the pinouts are as follows: name db-9 db-25 sg 5 7 td 3 2 rd 2 3 dtr 4 20 dsr 6 6 dcd 1 8 rts 7 4 cts 8 5 ri 9 22 now to address your problem at hand. when you connect a pc to a pc (a dte to a dte), there is no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right. there is no dce to assert the cts, dsr, dcd, or ri. so the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the dtr and rts outputs as well. if this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through sg, and crosses td and rd (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end, etc). the problem with this solution is that a pc that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other pc is ready. it would have to just send the data and hope it got through. therefore a better null modem would include the dtr/dsr pair crossed. a particular point a confusion is in the software area. just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them. if you are using the built-in bios to control the serial port, then the bios dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used. but if you have a comm. package such as brooklyn bridge, or lap- link or telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements. the only thing you can guess reliably is the sg, td, and rd. the dtr/dsr is also fairly common. there is one more issue that needs to be addressed here. and that is flow control. in the rs-232 scenerio, the dce's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the dce couldn't possible over-run the dte. by this i mean that as long as the dte has its dtr line asserted, the dce will send data - without requesting permission first. note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the dte must request permission by asserting the rts line and it must wait for the cts signal before it can send. and now in the dte to dte scenerio, the question is do you need flow control? the answser is usually. but how? for non-binary communications, one common technique is xon - xoff which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the td and rd carry the xon and xoff commands. this type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the xon or xoff codes and cause erroneous conrol signals. (a work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape" codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered). the problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard. there are lots of ways to do it and i bet they have all been tried. one cornerstone of all the methods is to use the rts/cts for one direction. but beyond that anything is fair game. again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. but i bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage. by the way, i am familiar with one package that uses rts/cts and dtr/dsr for flow control the rts is request to send and the dtr is ready to recieve, the cts is the clear to send and the dsr is the request to recieve. this does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software. the clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the uart directly controlled by the cts signal which means that the cts must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software. for these cases you will find cables that short the rts to the cts at the same end (or perhaps the dtr to the cts). other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires). specifically i am talking about the dsr. shorting the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this. it is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose. one more "gotcha" signal is the dcd. some software (including the pc bios) expects to see the dcd before it will work. this signal sometimes gets shorted with the dtr. but my favorite null modem has the rts and cts shorted at each end, but the rts is also connected through to the other end and connected to dcd. and of course the dtr/dsr are crossed as are the td/rd and of course the sg must pass through. this null modem works with most software. the flow control, if any, can use the rts/dcd with the dtr/dsr. if your comm. package does not specify the cable required for pc to pc connection, then i suggest you use this one. td ------ rd rd ------ td dtr ------ dsr dsr ------ dtr dcd ------ rts-\ /-rts ------ dcd | \-cts cts-/ gordon lang

hi: i need some advice (opinions?) regarding which pc would best suit my needs! i want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things: -	editing documents using wordperfect 5.1 (under dos) -	creating graphs/analyzing data using sigmaplot v5.0 (under dos) -	editing/playing with images using aldus photostyler, running under 	windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel -	using the pc as an xterminal, running desqview/x 1.1 and sun pc-nfs, 	talking to our network of sparcstation's - this is where a lot of 	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks. i've read, read, read pc magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup, and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be: 	486dx-50 256k cache, isa, vlb, 16meg ram 	ati graphics ultra pro, 2 meg ram, local bus 	15" monitor, 1280x1024 ni 	3com etherlink iii 16bit 	maxtor 240mb ide hard drive however, the parts don't fit! our local retailer apparently put one of these together, only to discover that the ati card wouldn't run at 50mhz - surprise surprise. actually, after reading this group, i'm surprised that they even have a 50mhz local bus running... i have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486dx2-66 with isa and vlb, or, a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thus the non-local bus version of the ati card). which is better, keeping in mind that i'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? any help would be greatly appreciated! (i need to decide quickly, so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!) btw: we have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following configuration: 	486dx-33 64k cache, isa, 8 meg ram 	ati graphics ultra+, 2 meg ram 	14" monitor, 1024x768 ni 	smc ethercard 8 bit 	maxtor 120mb ide hard drive we're quite happy with the ati card - very fast, once the data gets to it!! ~slow~ repainting images under photostyler that have moved off screen, or been uncovered! there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running desqview/x! its sluggish running the local window manager. also, many functions under photostyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram). there's not enough memory in the system - desqview/x and a 1 meg smartdrive don't leave much room for other apps. photostyler will page to disk with medium size images. i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network. going to the 16 bit version of the smc card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images). is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming?? will it make a difference? i'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486dx2-66 choice (above), for that reason. also, are there dx2-100's on the horizon? what about dx3-99's? dx3-150's ???! any information is greatly appreciated. ----- ross mitchell, imaging research lab, | rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca john p. robarts research institute | p.o. box 5015, 100 perth drive | office: (519) 663-3833 london, ontario, canada n6a 5k8 | home: (519) 657-4437

in case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money, i looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as i understand them). if you have a ps/2 model 70 or model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a cyrix 486dlc chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions. this chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16mhz machine the cyrix 486dlc will run at 16mhz. note: windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running windows. or, 2) you can get a kingston 486/now platform for $450 with a 25mhz i486sx on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you were running at 25mhz originally. but again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions. i think that it will continue to run at 25mhz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. there is also 3) the kingston 486/now platform for $750 with a 33mhz i486dx on it. this might speed up your math functions as well, but i am not sure. if you have a ps/2 model 70 b21 or other ps/2 machine with either an i486sx or a non-clock doubling i486dx (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33mhz) in it, then you can get an intel overdrive chip (which is really an i486dx2 chip) and replace your chip with it. you should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions. the 25/50 mhz version of the overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66mhz version costs $700. the replacement for the 25mhz 486sx chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486sx does not have. note that the speed ratings on the overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. if you have a 20mhz 486sx, then the overdrive chip will run at 20/40mhz, ie. 20mhz externally and 40mhz internally. there is no reason to buy an overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance. you should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week. you might want to shop around as prices do vary. if you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip, e-mail me, and i will respond with a couple of sources. lawrence khoo -- khoo@husc3.harvard.edu lawrence khoo computer consultant khoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu (617) 496-8992 econ. dept, harvard u.

i have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 mg seagate ide drive and a controler built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodrive 425f 425 mg formatted). i have no documentation at all and i need your help! as i understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive. could you please tell me if i'm right.. 1- buy a scsi contoler. which one? i know adaptec is good, but they are kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the $100 region? i want it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also, i have seen on the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true? does the adapter need to be the same as the drive? what type of drive is the quantum? 2- connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable. do i have to worry about the power supply? i think i have 200 watts and all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 3- setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type of drive is this? i don't have the numbers for this drive. 4- format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk? i think that ide drives can't be low-level formatted. is it the same with scsi? how exactly does fdisk work? i have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk. ideally, i would want the drive partitioned in to two partitions d: and e: how do i do this? well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting? any help is *really* appreciated, i'm lost... -eric ebosco@us.oracle.com

rationale --------- the rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs. at the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus. some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (cdpub has just been setup). in any case a list is not, and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. the reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics, and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext and multimedia publishing. topics such as cdrom xa, cdi, cd-r, photo cd and other related formats would be included as well. topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the internet. the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging software, data capture software, data clean up, compression, encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and video. the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture, such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. notes ----- these groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora. questions about cdroms mounted on lans should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. charter ------- proposed charter -- comp.publish.cdrom.software the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: 	index and retrieval software 	authoring software 	scanning and imaging software 	ocr and ocr cleanup 	hypertext 	sgml 	premastering and simulation (cdrom) software 	copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms 	other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing proposed charter -- comp.publish.cdrom.hardware the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: 	cd-r equipment 	data capture hardware 	scanners 	video and audio capture hardware 	networking hardware 	midi hardware 	photo cd hardware 	publishing systems 	cdi and dvi hardware 	compression and encryption hardware 	keyboarding 	other hardware publishing topics proposed charter -- comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia the usenet newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: 	multimedia authoring software 	imaging software 	audio and midi software 	color control software 	video editing software 	audio editing software 	multimedia utilities useful for publishers 	integration of text, image, audio and video 	compression and encryption of multimedia 	multimedia copyright and related legal issues 	multimedia databases and hypertext 	other multimedia publishing topics -- 	henry manaster * email: manaster@yu1.yu.edu 	brooklyn, ny * 	disclaimer: the above is not necessarily my opinion nor that 				of anyone else :-) ????!

serial cables: there are only three output signals: td, dtr, and rts. there are five inputs signals: rd, dsr, dcd, cts, and ri. there are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. the ibm bios requires asserts dtr and rts and then waits for both dsr and cts before sending. when a bios recieve call is made, it asserts dtr and waits for dsr to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if dsr never becomes true). it requires cts to be true for sending and recieving. most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol. the key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. my favorite cable works in many cases: short rts to cts at each end, but also run rts through to dcd at the opposite end. td runs through to rd and dtr runs through to dsr from both dte's and of course sg goes through to sg. i have never had trouble with this null modem even though i have used it with a comm. package that was expecting rts to go to cts instead of dcd. the advantage of this cable is that it also works with the ibm bios. gordon lang

thinking of buying from midwest micro of ohio? think *very* carefully. unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want to trade elsewhere. despite the fact that they answer the phone, "hi! i'm <whoever> and we're having a great day!", they weren't quite so happy when i wanted to return a modem that didn't work as i expected it to. the details: i ordered one of their house brand "infotel" 14.4/df internal fax modems. in reality, it was a twincom lightning fax that had a paper sticker over the name. given the poor reports on the net about this modem, i would not have ordered it, had i known this in advance. it arrived on time. the documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as com4, providing that com2 was not in use at the same time. for several reasons, i have a serial card configured for com1/com2. at the time i installed the modem, nothing was connected to com2. although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or 14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. after spending some time on the phone with midwest's tech support, they suggested disabling the com2 port. this appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long term solution. i had to have com1 and 2 available, even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem. i called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in voicemail hell, listening to repeated advertisements for midwest micro products. i was then promptly disconnected. apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. i called the next day and asked the customer diservice agent for an rma number. she promptly switched me to a "tech support" rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an rma number. he suggested i use some nonstandard irq settings, a solution i was not happy with. the modem should work as originally configured. conclusion: i'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, i gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a practical peripherals 14.4mt from pc connection. for $30 more, i have a solid external modem built by a company i know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. i should have known better...

the courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price. i've never taken a real look at the sportster line (only couriers), but from what i've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem. probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the courier does. i'm not sure if the sportster line is fully dsp driven like the (more recent) courier modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...i've never evaluated the sportster, so i'm going by bits and pieces that i've heard. if you want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who have worked with the sportster. personally, though, if i were going to look at the courier modems, i'd buy the dual standard...then i'd get both hst and v.32bis. in fact, this is exactly what i did. :-) i'm sitting here looking at my usr ds right now. and now, to correct a few very incorrect statements.... folks, if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or uart questions, post them to comp.dcom.modems. if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below). at least in cdm, if someone posts complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). >the sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression. just as it does at lower speeds, too. there is absolutely nothing in either ccitt recommendation v.42 or v.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running v.32bis. v.42bis, of course, is currently only *standardized* for operation on top of v.42 (in its primary mode of operation, lapm), but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this, v.42/v.42bis are also supported by the courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). >the difference >with the courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the hst mode. take a second look at the original question: >in a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (holly ks) says: >>what is the difference between the us robotics courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the v.32bis up there? the question was not about the courier hst modem, or about the courier dual standard...it was about the courier v.32bis modem. the modem in question does not support hst, period. it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb hst. also, not all courier hst / courier dual standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of hst. my dual standard only supports hst at 14.4 kb. there are even older models that only run hst at 9.6 kb. >this is a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of >the same type unit to achieve this speed. hst is usr's proprietary modulation scheme.... but we're not talking about hst, we're talking about v.32bis. v.32bis is most definitely *not* a proprietary modulation scheme. >the sportster will do >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous. the hst is one way >only. i do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off, v.32 and v.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous. this is part of the ccitt recommendation (i.e., part of the standard). it isn't a feature unique to the sportster (i just looked at the appropriate chapter in the courier ds manual). second, hst is not ``one way only.'' more correctly put, it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions. hst operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction, and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction. the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if you're logged on to say, a bbs, and type one letter and get screens of info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc.... there is, of course, a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. v.32 and v.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. >the hst's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available. again, more correctly put, *some* of the courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``v.fast'' is called when it's complete. if you have the large footprint courier modems (like i do), you're s.o.l..... there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which could eventually be upgraded to support v.fast, but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h> 73 de n5ial (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ internet: jim@n5ial.mythical.com | j.graham@ieee.org icbm: 30.23n 86.32w amateur radio: n5ial@w4zbb (ft. walton beach, fl) amtor selcal: nial ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ e-mail me for information about kamterm (host mode for kantronics tncs).

it seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the cyrix 386 compatible 486dlc and 486dru2. my info comes directly from cyrix's fast fax service: and also from installing one of these chips in an ibm model 80. the 486dlc is a 486 instruction set compatible cpu which fits into a 386dx socket (pin grid array, or pga). the dlc currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25, the 33, and the 40. they do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present. i guess they emulate the coproc instructions. math functions are on the 386dx level without the actual coprocessor. the internal cache on the 486dlc is 1k. cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate. my informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software. overall performance boost from a 386dx-25 to a 486dlc-25 is about 60%. the benchmarks i used were nu si and qaplus dhrystones and whetstones. the performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my 386dx-40 with 256k external cpu cache, which is around the performance for a 486sx-25. the computer runs noticebly faster, and dos 6 with dblspace is not complaining. the company claims os/2 compatibility, but i didn't test it. the 486dru2 is not a chip, as commonly thought. the 486dru2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386dx, which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler. this board plugs into the 386dx pga, and the 486dlc-33 or 40 plugs into this board. i guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the cpu, and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required. there are no info available from cyrix there. anyway, the dru2 is available for 386dx-16, and 386dx-20 only. double these clock rates, and you get the 32mhz and the 40mhz dlcs. if cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the dru2-50, then they need to put out the 50mhz dlc2 first... i also tested a dlc33 motherboard, along with a cyrix coprocessor. with 64k external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual intel 486dx. imho, the dlc is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or can't install, a new motherboard. it is definitely worth what i paid for it, but if you need 486dx-33 performance, the dlc33 won't cut it. i'm not sure about the dlc-40, but i think even if it matches the performance, it won't beat it in any significant way. the last time i posted info about the dlc, people sent quite a bit of mail, asking where i got it. so here is where i got mine: treasure chest peripherals, they advertise in the computer shopper. 1-800-677-9781 the 486dlc-25 kit was $179.00 but.... i liked the chip so much that i found the supplier, and became a dealer. if you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and i can fax or mail you more info. i'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use, so i can;t post anymore info here. however, if there are more questions regarding the 486dlc itself, i'll post what i can. jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= if someone asks if you are a god, you say... yes!

i bought a 386dx-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. everything appears to work, except i'm having trouble getting a few of the led connectors working. i've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. does this pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? any hints on where i can find this information? 1 10 "speaker" . . . . . . . . . . "keylock" . . . . . . . . . . 11 ^ 20 j23 | |the board came with a jumper vertically across these two pins. i can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and 19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation. the date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips. i would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance. n a stassen lantz

i must say that i have been a customer of midwest micro for over 4 years now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase. i have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (they) do have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been no problems in 6 of them that i know of. the fact that your time to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong. why you say because i must tell you of the 12 yes i say 12 ppi modems that i have had in the past that i was trying to use on my bbs. they all were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that i just said forget it and i wanted my money back. ppi's teck even said that they didn't even repair them. that they just strip the parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem. i think it was more your fault than midwest mirco's faulkt...sam -- gosh..i think i just installed a virus..it was called ms dos6... don't copy that floppy..burn it...i just love windows...crash...

i ran out of time on my last reply to this string and i don't know if it was sent or not but. i have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with midwest micro. they may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. but it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct things at all. the fact that the ppi worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system. when you find out things like the fact the the ec led that looks like you have connected to another ec modem, doesn't realy say that. but that it only tells you that you have ec turned on, on your modem. i think that these led are nothing more that just light to hype up the product. just like i bet someone took home a few extra $$$ in the last year for giving the ppi modems the pc-magazine award of the year. not so for the stash (12) of them that i saw on my test bench. i could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems that i found with the ppi modems but i will try to control myself. i will not even go into the 6 weeks it took ppi to credit my card back for the modems after they had received them back...no i will not go into that one nor will i go into talking to the parent co. co from hayes. i'll just say i hope you like your new modem and maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine i hope! -- gosh..i think i just installed a virus..it was called ms dos6... don't copy that floppy..burn it...i just love windows...crash...

hello, i've been following discussions on 17" monitors in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the nanao seems to get very good reviews. i'm interested in getting more information about nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. i would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 ni. i'm envisioning using this monitor on an amiga 4000 or amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the retina, and/or on a sun like the sparcstation lx. basically i want a high resolution versital monitor. this monitor need not be large (=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above. i've been very happy with a 16" on suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. i'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality sony and hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on sun's fairly often and look pretty good (to me at least). i haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are mag and viewsonic. ok, stuff i'd like to find out: how can i get ahold of nanao? what are the products in their line? what are the technical specs? esp. what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle? what's list and street cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can i get ahold of them? same info for sony and hitatchi. thank you very much!! -- ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`, ,`,`john navitsky`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`johnn@eskimo.com,`,`,`, ,`,`exercise a right today,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`, ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,

hi! i recently got hold of an old/obsolete pc. first thing i am trying to do with it, is making it work. seems the switches in the back have been toggled since last it was used, and i do not have the manual. can anybody help me to identify this beast, and mail me the prober switch-settings? all i know is that is is a bondwell 38, made in 1986, most likely a 286, can be toggled between 4.77 and 8 mhz, and looks like no changes have been made. any information would be appreciated. -- terje johansen at trondheim college of engineering, norway. my conscience once became so bad that it died.

hi, i have the following problem: i have to use a computer for special purposes that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. no monitor isn't a program - but no keyboard. i can't disable the keyboard from bios setup (in fact, there is no setup). i spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the bios with simply using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor. pity, pity... i lost contact to the person before getting more detail. so does anyone of you experts can help? thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-) thomas -- thomas s. opheys mutter beimer, erich, robert engel, tanja opheys@kirk.fmi.uni-passau.de schildknecht, klausi, onkel franz, rehlein, franz-stockbauer-weg 1/88 pichelsteiner, walze, else kling, iffi, w-8390 passau, germany -- ich liiiiiiebe euch! echt!

hello, a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and we've put in that machine a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 mb. but the problem is that the 200mb harddisk isn't supported in the bios. alas there's no user type 47 in the setup. at the moment we use it as a 193mb type but there are getting bad blocks on the harddisk :-<. question: who knows a solution to this? i've seen a small program for this once in the byte, but i haven't been able to find this. would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, i used these programs quite a lot in the xt-days, but i don't have these anymore, seagate used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold. help will be greatly appreciated. ronald schalk r.schalk@uci.kun.nl

i'm using norton cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible. some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and windows doesn't like it at all. but when copying or deleting lots of small files, only ncache is really fast. you see, to write a file the fat must be changed. but to write 1000 files the fat must be changed only once. is there any cache program out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my applications? any help is really appreciated.

==== begin repost ==== ibm, apple, motorola ready to unwrap powerpc 601 processor the wraps will come off the powerpc 601 processor this week, as motorola corp., ibm, and apple computer inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort. this first in a series of powerpc processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like intel corp.'s pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations, running at 50 and 66 mhz with performance of 40 and 50 specint89 marks, respectively, sources said. floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their specfp89 performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. the 601, a scaled-down version of the power 220 chip developed by ibm for its rs/6000 workstations, will also include a 32k single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in. the chip, which is being designed initially to support the micro channel architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop powerpc- based systems using a number of different architectures, including isa, eisa, or sun microsystems inc.'s s-bus design, one source noted. according to sources familiar with the development effort, motorola has been extremely successful in developing the powerpc as an inexpensive architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. initial chips are expected to be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than intel corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one source said. ==== end repost ====

for sale: at&t dataport internal 14.4k fax/modem the modem is an internal at/(e)isa 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card). it has v.32bis for 14.4kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and mnp5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line. they will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. it has a 16550 buffered uart for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (windows, os/2, unix, etc). they use a patented technology called optical line interface (oli) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. these modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from at&t. they also include the lovely and talented quicklink ii for dos and the new quicklink ii for windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any dos or windows application just by printing. the windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc. the dos version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (i believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any hp laser ii resident fonts). i'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus utah tax). this is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including zoom, us robotics, etc). and, it is backed by a company that will never go away. this price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown slc. i can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up. (if you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) if you're interested, please let me know. this is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300). i installed one of these last week and it is very nice. if you have questions about this, at&t has an info number at (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and i will attemp to answer them. the modem will go to the highest bidder i get within the next week. thanks. pete

i am desperately trying to find a pc based e-mail wide area network service or the necessary network software to establish one myself. while i am aware there are various bbs's and other similar services avalible (like compuserve, canada remote systems etc.) i require fairly specific criteria. in approximate order of importance they are: 1) the mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(note: all users are remote and will use modems over conventional phone lines.) 2) simple. the users i have for the system have very little computer knowledge have never heard of unix, and have very little interest in learning. it is essential that the client software is completely pain-free. 3) cheap. we would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the group - hence (1). in addition i would like the network server to be something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (there are only about 40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.) 4) the capability for internet access (for news/mail). 5) internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca) if anyone knows of a system similar to what i am describing, even if it doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and i don't care where it is, please please e-mail me and tell me about it. we are not adverse to making alterations to an existing system if necessary. thanks. peter wood internet id: pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca

(hmm. i know that you have to disable something related to the scsi bios, but i'm not sure if it is the rom itself.) back in february, someone asked about ide and scsi (this question gets asked again and again). at the end of this message, i've included an edited copy of my reply. you might find it interesting. -- darryl okahata 	internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com disclaimer: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support, opinion or policy of hewlett-packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day. =============================================================================== > 1) is it worth it to get scsi over ide? will there be a noticable > decrease in access time/increase in xfer rate? for msdos applications, isa-based scsi and ide controllers generally have comparable throughput. you might get slightly higher throughput with a scsi disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk ($30-$100 and up, in some cases). you'll also pay much, much more for a good scsi controller. note that good scsi controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system (like a pc unix). unfortunately, neither msdos nor windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system. the performance advantage of scsi controllers is mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the scsi bus as the only advantage. however, note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi devices. if you're only going to be using msdos, stick with ide. it's cheaper, and you'll have less headaches. > 4) will virtually any scsi device chain into the controller for my > hard-drive (bernoulli box, cd-rom, tape drive, etc). [ note: the following is true for msdos/windows only. who knows what the future holds for windows nt and unix??? ] no. generally, you have to find drivers for each scsi device, which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high performance" scsi controllers. these are typically bus-mastering scsi controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand scsi devices either come with the card, or can be purchased (for under $100 list price). examples of such driver kits are: * adaptec's ez scsi kit (list: $75). this works only with adaptec scsi controllers. * corelscsi! (from the same people who make coreldraw!) (list: $99 (?)). this driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card that has an aspi driver, like the adaptec. central point's pc tools for dos 8.0 supports a number of scsi tape drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives). unfortunately, it works only with adaptec controllers. > 5) are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a > scsi controller and sound cards/video accelerators/and similar > equipment. yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a high-performance, bus-mastering scsi controller. this doesn't sound right, doesn't it? it's true, though. with one of these controllers, you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the cms jumbo 250), and windows 3.1. i know. i've been to h*ll and back getting my scsi controller to work with various hardware/software (thank god for tape backups). if you want a copy of my "adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file, send email. these problems aren't really the fault of the scsi controller card; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the pc (e.g., no standards). however, adding a bus-mastering scsi card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible. scsi holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of pc compatibility problems. if you're planning on using only msdos/windows 3.1, stick with ide. if you want to use windows nt or a pc unix, you'll have to make some hard decisions: a good scsi controller and more than one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the possible cost of msdos compatibility. [ i say, "probably", because, while i know this to be true with a pc unix, i don't know if this really will be true of windows nt. i suspect that it will, but i don't know for sure. ]

my 486dx2-50 has 8mb of 70ns ram and a trident svga card. sometimes i feel it runs very slowly, especially when running windows. i'm planning to buy an ati graphic ultra + next semester. is that all i need to get the problem solved? is 70ns ram chips too slow for my machine? do faster ram chips make a big difference? i use cad software on my computer as well. do those up-grades good enough to speed it up a lot? any one experienced the difference between isa bus and vl bus(both with a graphic accelerator)? (a scsi controller may not be appropriate, since i may have to replace my hard disks as well. however, sometimes i do have huge files on my computer. does it really worth to use a scsi interface? i can't spend too much on it) t he ) any help will be appreciated. thanks in advance. dennis dpang@uafhp.uark.edu p.s. man! i hate the stupid text editor. is there any way i can type my article in a dos word-processor and load the file into usenet? thanks in advance again!
do all scsi cards for dos systems require a separate device driver to be loaded into memory for each scsi device hooked up? will this also be true of the 32-bit os's? thanks. randy
i posted almost the same bad experience with midwest micro but our %^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. in addition to the facts that: (a) the modems (i had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented and (b) the tech person had no clue as to how it should work, it also turned out that: (c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly used but the techs thought that was standard practice and (d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and my cms250 tape drive start running away. that they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff as new and won't even apologize for it is another. stay away from these crooks! bob wilson wilson@math.wisc.edu

i went out and bought the pas16 yesterday, and installed it into my gateway dx2-66v. i followed the instructions and set the sb side with dma 1 and irq5 (the default) and then the pas side with dma 5 and irq 10. my question is how should i configure for mpu-401 compatibility. the manual and installation program recommended irq2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to irq8-15. so can i still use irq2, or should i choose a different one? right now i have the mpu-401 emulation mode turned off. actually what is this "cascade to irq8-15" business? a related questions (to other gw or vl-bus machine owners) i was told that only dma 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit dmas, and 0-4 are 8 bit dmas. now what about 32-bit vl-bus mastering dmas?? which dma channel(s) is used by the vl-bus extension to do 32-bit dma? yet another question, after installing pas16, my links (golf game) will hang the machine when i select sb mode and run, but works with adlib mode?? civilization however works fine ( at least so far). any body knows what i might have done wrong? thanks (i am obviously a newbie) -- john

a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card. a pretty nice board. fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the svga modes i have whined about here on occasion. at the time i was just buying a vlb system, so after checking out the card i sent it back. i wanted a vlb card, and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card. this card is fairly fast, will do 70 hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my cd-roms (the svga thing -- i think; i have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards i have tried. i have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody...). the monitor i am using it with is a 17" magnavox, which also tops out at 1024x768x70 hz so its really a pretty good match. but... that is for my wife. i just purchased a viewsonic 17 for myself, and am looking for a graphics card to drive it. i want > 70hz refresh, and would really like it to handle my cd-roms. i tried the orchid p9000, which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the >70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base). so my thoughts go back to hercules. they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the graphite around the end of march. i have heard precisely zero about it since then. does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities (and price) it has? any info would be most appreciated. geoff sherwood

i have one of these monitors. it appears to function ok, but is unhookable to anything standard (cga,ega,vga) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy diagonal noise. i also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector with a picture of monitor). i tried plugging these two into a standard at to no avail. how can one connect these to (the monitor seems to be of relatively high quality, so i'm curious)? any special drivers and/or setup needed - i can't locate any jumpers on the card.

wow, you guys are really going wild on this ide vs. scsi thing, and i think it's great! however, i think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question: which would you choose, and why? like lots of people, i'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a), and what i would say is a standard (not special, no cache i believe) ide controller card on my isa 486-50. i'm currently thinking about adding another hd, in the 300mb to 500mb range. and i'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit). i believe i'm getting something like 890kb/sec transfer right now (according to nu). how would this number compare if i bought the state-of-the-art scsi card for my isa pc, and the state-of-the-art scsi hard drive (the wailing-est system i could hope for)? obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would you want to use on your isa system? and how much would it cost? along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd's if i were to buy the top-of-the-line ide caching controller for my 200mb, 15ms hd? and how much would it cost? i actually have a pas-16, and could (what a waste i guess it would be...) hook up a scsi hd through it's scsi port which yields an optimum of 690kb/sec. actually, i have a borrowed 12ms fujitsu hd hooked up through it now (and own the trantor hd drivers for the pas-16 scsi port). is this scsi port a scsi-2 port? how could i tell? is the fujitsu 2623a a scsi-2? are all scsi hd's scsi-2? thanks for any comments. randy
yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 bnc's on it, and is expecting to get a composite sync signal on the "green"? there ought to be a little black box that takes the vga signalling (which has horiz, vert, and composite sync on different pins, plus the r, g, and b pairs) and merges the green and composite sync together in the output. it's all 1v analog, as far as i know. i can build this with op-amps but i don't think i can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen. does anyone know of a vga->rgb(composite sync on green) converter? -- paul vixie, dec network systems lab	 palo alto, california, usa 	"don't be a rebel, or a conformist; <vixie@pa.dec.com> decwrl!vixie		they're the same thing, anyway. find <paul@vix.com> vixie!paul		your own path, and stay on it." -me

greetings.. i'm a novice in messing comp. hardware. my original ide hd is a 42mb western digital which came with the system when i bought it. and i just got a 213mb ide hd maxtor that i wanted to add as a slave drive. i did change the jumper settings on 213a maxtor to configure it as slave drv, but i didn't change anything on my 42m western dig, since i didn't have any doc. on it. and as i predicted, it just beeped and gave me an error message about hdd controller. so, i had to take my 42m off & install my 213a to be my only hd. any help on this matter would be much appreciated. (before i trashed my 42mb) thankx much handy trisakti - uc532838@mizzou1.missouri.edu
which would you choose, and why? like lots of people, i'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a), and a standard ide controller card on my isa 486-50. i'm currently thinking about adding another hd, in the 300mb to 500mb range. and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit). i believe i'm getting something like 890kb/sec transfer right now (according to nu). how would this number compare if i bought the state-of-the-art scsi card for my isa pc, and the state-of-the-art scsi hard drive (the best system i could hope for)? obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would you want to use on your isa system? and how much would it cost? along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd's if i were to buy the top-of-the-line ide caching controller for my 200mb, 15ms hd? and how much would it cost? thanks for any comments. randy
just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. remember those 21 mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? these drives are scsi devices and can read and write both 720 kb and 1.44/21 mb disks. sounds to me to be one great product for the pc market. are the prices really that unaffordable compared to cd-roms which are currently not rewritable? i know about the new rewritable cds and expect sony to develop the first mds for the computer. my question is: why isn't there any substantial interest in developing the flopticals? just a thought. kin chan sparrow+@cmu.edu

hi peeps, here's another of those "any ideas" type queries. i've been given an oldish phillips televideo terminal type thingy, without a keyboard. but no problem so far. when i dismantled it, i discovered that it is really just a standard rgb monitor with built in modem/rom software etc. phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the rgb inputs, so i connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. the problem is that i have no idea where to connect the sync lines. the display rolls continuously, but does change modes (ok only to cga - but useful for my laptop). any of you wonderful people any knowledge of phillips monitors? i've tried phillips in the uk and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort, but phillips computer is now under the auspices of dec (at least in the uk). dec said sorry phillips don't make it any more. what is it anyway? a uk support dealer said "circuit diagrams? sync?" so any ideas. john. ____________________________________________________________________ quote: computer scientists are not boring. they're wonderful, exciting, interesting people who just happen to like talking to inanimate objects as if they are human. by me.

i am planning on upgrading my old xt compatible system with a new motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 mb floppy. i am interested in using my old power supply (150 w) to power the new hardware, if possible. i have been told by the motherboard vendor that i could probably use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard. (apparently some xt vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the 12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery). my question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire out of an 11 wire supply or using an auxiliary power source to charge the motherboard battery? i do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if i can make use of my existing one with simple hacks. thank you for any information. an email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine. -larry arbanas
for the past week or so i've been trying to install a qic-36 tape drive and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 eisa system with no luck. i end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read part of the test. i am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind, retension, write and erase, i also booted the system clean and still the same proble so i also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. it has been suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that i need to slow it down. my system has an ami bios and i don't have the advanced chip setting option that i have seen on other systems so i cant do this. am i going to have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work around? i will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions. tony

[discussing the use of irq 7] in recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (mike sprague) writes: >i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written >(i can't prove it's true, but i believe it), lpt1 does not >actually use irq7, even though that interrupt is supposed to >be dedicated to lpt1. to put it a little differently: - irq 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - dos doesn't monitor irq 7; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer. - most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of irq 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the irq line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't assert anything). the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. (incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold the irq line low when no interrupt is desired. if that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines, and that certainly isn't a requirement.) - non-dos operating systems (os/2, nt (?), various unices or whatever the proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq 7 for performance reasons. and the sb16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers. joe morris / mitre (jcmorris@mitre.org)

hi, that might look like a dull request, but i have been following this newgroup for a couple of weeks and it didn't help me make my mind. i bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (i have been running on an xt 5mhz till last january!!). the machine i bought came equipped with a ati vga xl 24 graphic card. it gives a very nice picture and the windows drivers are pretty stable. the only problem is that it is quite slow. i would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). i saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. my question is : could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. i would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide; - quality of windows drivers; - standard vga performance (non-windows stuff). direct me to a magazine article or something like that (i got winvid.zip info, but it is not enough). if you have an isa card you are really satisfied with it, let me know. 	if this information is of any use, here is my system configuration: 	- fujikama 486 33mhz isa system (contaq motherboard) 	- monitor darius 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024x768) (can reach 70khz horizontally) i would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the eprom of the graphic card. this is the case with my ati card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings. merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me, 					guy lamouche 					lamouche@ere.umontreal.ca

i believe i have the same monitor problem. i have a system from micron computers with the 15" mag 1564 (the same monitor as the gateway) and am having the same symptoms. what's this with removing the monitor extension cable? 				thanks for any info.
then again, maybe $2445 for the gateway system isn't too cheap. i have a system from micron computers: 486-2-50, 16 meg ram, 245 maxtor hd, local bus ide / 2 meg video card, and the same 15" monitor. the system with shipping came to $2200. i sold the sx-33 chip that came with it and bought a dx2-50. total price $2300-2400.

the fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly loud. has anyone found a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? short of buying a notebook pc, i don't know what to do. oh yeah, i did hear about a power supply called a "silencer" - which is supposed to be more quiet. has anyone had experience with this? i was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270watt silencer. i've even considered stuffing my pc case in one of those acoustic "printer enclosures", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. also, i'm guessing that would also cut the ventilation. any other ideas? thanks in advance for any suggestions! please e-mail whatever you post... -- alexander lerman <alerman@netcom.com> (510) 848-4888 (voice)

my pc is a 486-33dx (isa) with ami bios and opti chipset. i am thinking of replacing the ami bios chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). my questions are: 1. do i just take out the old one and plug in a new? 2. anything else i have to take care of? what precautions should i take? 3. where can i get the new bios chip, compusa, mailorder or what? (i live in orange county california). 4. what is the most up-to-date version? 5. very important. how much would it be? thank you for your help. paul.

my 3.5" floppy drive stopped recognizing low density (720k) floppies. the controller and drive works fine in another system. i was told it could be the dma chip. the system is a 386dx-25 using chips & technology chip set. i'm open to all suggestions. please send your replies to: 		ken@jazz.concert.net thanks in advance!!!
gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people who responded to the original request for help. the ati vlb video board uses the addresses for com 4. they could suggest no work around. i will be returning the df io card they supplied for com 4 (even though it could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse. this will free up the com port i need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either the df io card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know enough about the hardware. otherwise i must say that the 486dx2/66 system has worked very well - no problems with any other hardware or software. john siegel k4bnc@cbnewsh.att.com

on a few computers which we have here at sheridan college there are files which we would like to make read only. i have used the dos attrib command but some people, who carry around the attrib program in their pockets, have still been able to erase some of the more important files. are there any software packages which would make an entire drive read-only? an example, partition the drive into two partitions and have the first drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second drive you could both read and write. any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated. thanx. mark.zander@sheridanc.on.ca
howdy, i recently upgraded the original bios in a compaq deskpro 286/12 with a phoenix replacement bios, in order to support an ide hard drive, and a high-density 3.5" floppy. i assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but i have encountered a problem that phoenix and compaq are unwilling to admit responsibilty for, and i was wondering if anyone else had seen it. everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5" floppy, which will read, but not write diskettes. any write attempt merely corrupts both fats. i have tried everything i can think of. any takers? -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ micah h. lax <ab670@freenet.carleton.ca> <micah@bnr.ca> on internet ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
organization: compact solutions, canberra act australia i have a floppy drive which has developed "general failure" errors. (it's a teac 1.44mb 3.5" drive). i took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. i used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now. however, it didn't help the problem. i've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time. what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector. is there anything more i can do to try and save this drive? i'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if i can help it. thanks! cheers, ben ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ben j. elliston bachelor of engineering (computer engineering) \\\// university of canberra (@ @) ___ooo_( )_ooo__ email: compsol@fir.canberra.edu.au v also: ellib@cbr.cpsg.com.au uucp: ..!uunet!munnari!sserve.adfa.oz.au!compsol!root fidonet: 3:620/262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * origin: % compact solutions % canberra act australia % (3:620/262)

below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome monitors which computer shopper lists as pc compatible. i've omitted radius because radius states that they no longer support the pc. you will notice that nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5khz horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by vga cards at boot up. my guess is that all the other monitors come with their own graphics cards. i've left voice mail with nanao asking them to send me some literature, and will report back to the net after i've studied it. the prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship to reality. 					kenneth almquist --------------------------------- cut here --------------------------------- cornerstone technology 1990 concourse dr. san jose, ca 95131 408-435-8900 dualpage 120: diagonal: 19 inches max resolution: 1600x1280 frequencies: 105khz horizontal, 76hz vertical dimensions: 19x18x17 inches price: $1495 compatible with: pc;ps/2 dualpage 150: diagonal: 19 inches max resolution: 2048x1538 frequencies: 105khz horizontal, 67hz vertical dimensions: 19x18x17 inches price: $1595 compatible with: pc;ps/2 ikegami electronics (u.s.a.), inc. 37 brook ave. maywood, nj 07670 201-368-9171 dm-2010ad: diagonal: 20 inches max resolution: 1280x1024 frequencies: 48-64khz horizontal, 59-80hz vertical price: $995 compatible with: pc image systems corp. 11595 k-tel hopkins, nm 55343 800-462-4370 or 612-935-1171 m21lmax: diagonal: 21 inches max resolution: 2048x1536 frequencies: 48-108khz horizontal, 60-80hz vertical dimensions: 17x20x19 inches price: $1995 compatible with: pc;ps/2;mac m21lv-65max: diagonal: 21 inches max resolution: 1280x1024 frequencies: 15-65khz horizontal, 55-90hz vertical price: $4695 compatible with: pc;ps/2;mac m21pmax : diagonal: 21 inches max resolution: 1280x1664 frequencies: 48-108khz horizontal, 60-80hz vertical dimensions: 19x15x17 inches price: $2500 compatible with: pc;ps/2;mac m24pmax : diagonal: 24 inches max resolution: 1280x1664 frequencies: 48-108khz horizontal, 60-80hz vertical dimensions: 22x18x18 inches price: $2600 compatible with: pc;ps/2;mac nanao usa corp. 23535 telo ave. torrence, ca 90505 310-325-5202 flexscan 6500: diagonal: 21 inches max resolution: 1664x1200 frequencies: 31.5;56-80khz horizontal, 55-90hz vertical dimensions: 18x20x17 inches price: $1989 compatible with: pc;ps/2;mac ran-ger technologies, inc.

(it's an *old* tape drive.) my solution was to use irq3 (also used for com2, where my modem is). i did this because i reasoned i would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously. when kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for irq3 and uses the serial port. if the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller. (and since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely "hang.") likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for irq3. that handler won't do anything for the serial port. under dos, printing is not interrupt-driven. instead, the bios polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. that's why you can have your sound card and lpt1 both configured to use irq7. try that on nt and see how far you'll get. :-) -- kenneth r. ballou				voice:		 (617) 494-0990 oberon software, inc.				fax:		 (617) 494-0414 one memorial drive, cambridge, ma 02142	internet: ballou@oberon.com the views and opinions expressed above are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.

quantum lps240a hard disk phantom seeks i just purchased and installed a 240mb quantum 3.5" hard drive, model lps240a, and have a concern about its behavior. although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file i/o, it performs what i call phantom seeks. when the pc is absolutely idle, i can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. this activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk led never comes on. [the disk led is attached to the disk controller card, not the drive.] my other hard disk, a seagate st3283a, does not have this kind behavior. can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon? -- --------------------- steve harrold			swh@cup.hp.com 				hpg200/11 				(408) 447-5580 ---------------------
i have a 486/33 ibm clone with two serial ports (com1, com2) and mouse port. both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board. i tried to install a 2400 buad hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work. once i dial any number the system locks. i do not hear any click or ring before it the system hangs. the modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port. once i change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again. then i bought a 2400 baud hayes external modem and checked the system. it works fine with both the serial ports. the internal modem has been checked on another machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine. can anyone please help me to find the problem. thanks narm gadiraju ngadiraj@infonode.ingr.com

i got a et4000/w32 card which is made by cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it. the card is a vl-bus card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1mb dram. it comes with et4000/w32 window drivers and a normal et4000 drivers. the et4000/w32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32k and 64k colours. here is my winmark result running on a 16mb 486dx33 eisa/vl-bus system using hint chipsets. winmark 3.11 from zd lab. using et4000/w32 drivers 640x480 256 10.63 megapixel/sec. 32k 7.34 64k 7.30 800x600 256 10.07 32k 6.38 64k 6.35 1kx786 256 8.17 using et4000 drivers. 640x480 16m 1.78 800x600 16colours 4.01 1kx786 16 4.22 from the result, the et4000/w32 drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the et4000/w32 chip whereas the et4000 drivers are just normal driver for et4000 based graphics card. the price of this graphics card that i got is $185 from a local dealer. it may be less from mail order. it has os/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution. from these results, it has double the performance of a et4000ax based card in 256 colours mode. philip sinn sinn@carson.u.washington.edu university of washington * it is all my opinions *

anyone have experiences, good or bad, with replacing the mfm controller and drive with an ide controller and drive in a zenith 386/16? i had heard some rumors about bus mastering problems on some cpu board revisions. -- shamus mc bride | tecslm1@sdc.boeing.com boeing computer services | tecslm1%sdc@atc.boeing.com (206) 865-5047 | uw-beaver!bcsaic!sdc!tecslm1
could someone please tell me if the 486slc and 486slc2 processors ibm is putting in their thinkpad 700's and other pc's is a real 486 with a math coprocessor or if it is really some kludge that should not be called a 486 at all? thanks, eric -- eric w. braeden | "der verstand war zwar praechtig ohio state university | doch das nuetzte am ende nicht viel" ebraeden@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu | peter schilling 120 grad 1983
i have a 105mb ide drive and am having a few problems! i get 'data error on drive c' messages when reading some files. the problem is also steadily getting worse. i have run some diagnostic software (pctools v7.1) and it says that the drive is ok - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read). does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these sectors as bad (dos doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format. i have heard that the latter is possible on an ide. technical answers would be appreciated. it would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!! i am running ms-dos 5 on an at clone.

i know this is the wrong newsgroup, but i was wondering if anyone knows the date(s) of this year's comdex convention in atlanta,ga. or has it passed already?? e-mail if possible. thanks.
i originally posted a complaint about how noisy my pc was. i got several useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your pc in silence by removing the fan altogether! two variables: 1) i always run my pc without the cover, and 2) i'd be willing to attach a cpu cooler if that would make a difference. should i try to run my pc without a fan? i know it sounds like utter folly so i'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? or tragically? you're answer may save my pc... thanks. -- alexander lerman <alerman@netcom.com> (510) 848-4888 (voice)
i have a 286 with a western digital wd-93044a hard drive. this drive is 782 cylinders with 4 read write heads physically, but logically it is 977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!). in the cmos setting i am instructed to set it to type 17 (ibm 977 cyl. 5 read/write heads), the problem: i was sent western digitals ispfmt low level program from the manufacturer, and was instructed to run it on the hard drive with the cmos setting set to type 17. this worked "o.k." and i verified the disk using the same program. i then reloaded dos which did a high level format, again no errors, no bad sectors, etc. but.... when i run norton speedisk 6.01 (or any other disk optimizer) with the verify option set on, i get error verifying sector nnnn, where nnnn can be any number (not the same all the time). any ideas as to what is going on here would be appreciated! thank you! steve hamilton nbb1424@dsacng1.dla.mil
i have a 486 dx 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. i'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know if i can use a dx/2 66mhz cpu. the bios is late model ami, circa 1991, and the system crystal is approx 66.3mhz. my question is, can i just replace the original 33mhz cpu with the new dx/2 cpu? if its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans?? mike
