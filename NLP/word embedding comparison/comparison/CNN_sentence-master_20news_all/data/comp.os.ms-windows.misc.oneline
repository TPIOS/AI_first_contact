using a windows 3.1 printer driver, i would like to "print to a file", with output as a postscript file. later, i would like to take this postscript file to a machine with an attached hewlett packard 4m laser printer, and print the document at 600 dots per inch resolution. i would like to use this method to print from wordperfect for windows, and from an image processing program that can output images in postscript. here's the problem: the windows postscript printer driver (pscript.drv) doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi. in fact, the setup dialog for this driver does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the menu is 300! not a really useful menu. any ideas? david arnstein arnstein@iis.sun.com international imaging systems milpitas, california

i have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a slip client on a pc" posts for a few months. lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for march or earlier this month -- for which i apologize. this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with phone. for additions, modifications and corrections, i can be reached at <ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu> best wishes, ashok -- begin slip.txt -- based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows, here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment. i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- configuring your modem: a) turn off dtr (at&d0&w) i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use to dial my slip server (qmodem) drops dtr when i exit the program and therefore hangs up the line. if you use a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connection, then this need not be done. these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit. note: if you use univ. of minn. phone to dial and establish a slip connection, you do not need to turn off dtr. b) dial and establish the slip connection first. this can be done automatically if you use a program like phone (from the university of minnesota) which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the slip packet driver. the phone scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with other slip server. in addition, while the only packet driver that phone works with is umslip (currently), it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers. there is a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file examples. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- configuring the slip drivers: there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipper.exe peter tattam's compressed slip driver slipper.exe peter tattam's slip driver slip8250.com crynwr driver (i like phil burn's modified driver) ethersl.com crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over slip) umslip.com univ. of minnesota driver (based on slip8250) of these four, i vastly prefer c/slipper.exe over slip8250.com or ethersl.com for the following reasons: a) it is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 uart b) while using etherslip/slip8250/umslip, myself and several others have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a long ftp transfer. c) it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d) when used in ethernet simulation mode c/slipper seem to work with every tcp/ip application that i have tested it with. instructions for c/slipper.exe (and you do not use phone) a) load slipper in your autoexec.bat file according to instructions: for instance if you have a v.32bis modem on com1 slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) if you use dos tcp/ip applications in win 3.1 dos boxes, then use the double-ended packet driver shim winpkt.com -- this creates a virtual packet driver at 0x60. dos applications in native mode, dos applications in windows 3.1 dos boxes and windows applications can all use this virtual driver at 0x60. winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) if you use qvt/net, load pktint.com next. qvt/net is configured in qvtnet.ini to use the interrupt at 0x60. pktint.com instructions for slip8250.com: a) try getting a version 10 slip driver. philip burns of northwestern university has a modified slip8250.com driver that is better at hardware handshaking. this driver is distributed along with nupop. b) load the driver after establishing the slip connection. my modem is a v.32bis modem on com1, so here is how i would load the driver. slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 slip 0x03f8 57600 c) as discussed above if you use dos tcp/ip applications in windows 3.x dos boxes, you probably want to use winpkt.com winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) if you use winqvt/net, load pktint.com pktint.com instructions for ethersl.com: if you choose to use ethersl.com instead of slip8250.com, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. you will have to delete the line "device=*vcd" from the [386enh] section of system.ini. this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications (such as crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped characters etc. in these applications. this is therefore not recommended. etherslip would be loaded as: ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- configuring windows 3.1: a) make the following modifications to the system.ini file [386enh] section. i) list all your com ports, with their addresses and interrupts. com1base=03f8 com1irq=4 com2base=02f8 com2irq=3 com3base=03e8 com3irq=5 this can also be done from within windows - control panel, but double-clicking on the "ports" icon. ii) give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer com1buffer=10000 iii) change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish to use for your modem to zero. this is the amount of time that windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to another application. if you use winqvt/net and then want to switch from one session to another, and this value is at the default value of 2 seconds, you are will get a gpf and windows will crash. com1autoassign=0 this can also be done from within windows - control panel. double-click on 386 enhanced, and under "device contention", set the device contention for the com port your modem is on to "never warn" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session? i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address, so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet.ini each time that i establish a slip connection. if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use bootp aware software, and let bootp do the configuration for you. however, qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection. to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following: edit the qvtnet.ini file. let the [net] section look like this: [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate) save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file "attrib +r qvtnet.ini" start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and ip address that you are assigned. each time you start qvt/net 3.1x, the general configuration dialog box will open. enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session, click on [ok], and you should be up and running. the changes you make will not be saved, as qvtnet.ini is write-protected. a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation. bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip, which is then saved to a file called "myip". another file "noip" is essentially a complete qvtnet.ini file that lacks the ip address. in the final step "myip" and "noip" are copied into a single qvtnet.ini file. an example of victor's batch file is provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\"" >> myip bootpq -i "my ip# is: %s" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip @echo off echo . echo ready to run winqvtnet ===================================================== for questions and more details about bootpq, please contact victor menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- how do you use pktmux over slip? pktmux will not work over the slip8250.com packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ethersl.com pktmux will work with c/slipper.exe, when c/slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode. an example of this configuration is shown below: the latest release of pktmux is 1.2c; and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows (to be released very shortly). [from autoexec.bat] lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5 (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used for qvt/net) lh pktint.com (qvt/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65 (pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet) additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows 3.1 dos boxes. for example, my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file "popmail.bat". this is what popmail.bat reads like: pktdrv 60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u unloads the packet driver at 0x60 exit causes the dos window to close i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp/ip applications like pc gopher. it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt. for example within two different dos boxes -- one for popmail and the other for gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c/slipper? i have a v.32bis/v.42bis modem in a 386-33 running windows 3.1 with a reasonably fast video card (ati graphics ultra). under these conditions, when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows: a) driver at 0x7f -- qvtnet ftp client session b) driver at 0x60 in one dos window -- cutcp tn3270 session c) driver at 0x60 in another dos window -- trumpet for dos i get ftp transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring compressed files. this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single tcp/ip session is active. if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active, i get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same files. while there is about 40% degradation in the performance of slipper, for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- c/slipper and ethernet simulation mode in ethernet simulation mode, c/slipper ver 1.3 works with all the applications that i have tested it with. one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at c/slipper 1.2, but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3 when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with pktmux, i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads "ip:incorrect packet type" or "ip:bad version number". this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning, although i cannot comment on loss of performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- what can you do if your dos tcp/ip application does not work with c/slipper in ethernet simulation mode? in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with c/slipper in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author -- peter tattam -- peter@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him know. chances are that he can fix it. in the meanwhile, you can try the following. i do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when i had problems with c/slipper ver 1.2 (c/slipper is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the pktmux section) i load ethersl.com at 0x60, run the application and then terminate ethersl.com this also works within windows 3.1 virtual dos boxes. however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time. so for example, here is my batch file to run grateful med (a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine). ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads etherslip cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60 terminates etherslip exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows if you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time. after closing the ethersl window, you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem. btw, the example above -- grateful med, works with no problems with c/slipper ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- phone script files: the documentation that accompany phone, provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server. for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend. background: to start a slip connection, i dial our terminal server, and login with a username and password. after doing so, i start a slip session with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu", followed by my password -- again. here then is the relevant portion of the phone.cmd script file - # # cwru-ts2 slip login script by ashok aiyar 3/26/93 # last revised 3/28/93 procedure host.cwru.login timeout 60 'cwru-ts2 terminal server is not responding' message "cwru-ts2 slip login script -- version 1.1" message 'waiting for slip server to respond' quiet on expect 'verification' message 'request for user verification received from cwru-ts2' message 'sending your user name and password' quiet off expect 'username:' send '%u<' expect 'password:' private send '%p<' reject 'access denied' 'your user name or password was not accepted' timeout 30 'slip server did not respond to your validation request' expect 'cwru-ts2>' send 'slip<' timeout 10 'slip server did not respond to slip command' expect 'ip hostname or address:' send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<' timeout 10 'slip server did not respond to hostname' reject 'bad ip address' 'incorrect hostname' expect 'password:' send '%p<' reject 'access denied' 'password not accepted.' timeout 10 expect 'header compression will match your system' message 'login to cwru slip server successful' wait 1.0 endprocedure host.cwru.login # # procedure host.cwru.logout # nothing special needs to be done to logout endprocedure host.cwru.logout # # end of script file # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- how to use packet drivers other than umslip with phone? the quick answer -- there is no "clean" way. below is a batch file hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers. in this example, the packet driver is peter tattam's cslipper. to use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and irq. this batch file requires umslip.com, cslipper.exe, and termin.com to be in the same directory or in your path ... all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection using phone, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the connection, and unload the driver when you are done ... -- being cwruslip.bat -- @echo off rem this batch file is an ugly hack of u. of minn.

i am having a really bothersome problem using the msdos prompt in windows 3.1 to open a dos box. when i am done with the dos box, i cant get back to windows. if i do alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes black and i have to control-alt-delete until i kill windows. i get a couple of screens about app not responding. i think things are still alive under the black screen because if i alt-tab to cycle through the running apps, i get flashes of text but then the black returns. this persists even if the machine is powered on and off. i am working with an app developed using borland's 3.1 application frameworks and c++. it seems to work fine. hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network. video is a tseng vga. dos 5.0. i reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back. i am using temporary swapping for virtual memory. i would really really appreciate any hints anyone might offer. thanks, jim cant

i am having something very unusual happen. first some background on my system. i have a mitsubishi 63 meg hard drive, and am running smartdrv (the version that comes with windows 3.1) on it. i rarely use windows. i use a program called disk technician gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive. it works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting. my hard drive is notorious for bad sectors. i usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week. here's what happened: i ran a program, and dtg broke in with an emergency warning and recommended i reboot. it gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded. i exited the program and did just this. dtg went through its bootup process, examining for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time. i then went back to the program, executed it again, and the exact same error was detected. i rebooted and tried again, and the same error happened again. so, i removed dtg from memory, and went to the program to see if i could detect anything wrong. sure enough there was a number of read attempts. so i rebooted and reloaded dtg, but removed the cache. i executed the program. no read errors, either audible or detected by dtg. i quit the program, loaded the cache, and ran the program again. the errors were detected. ok, so the errors are there, and dtg detects but doesn't fix them, when the cache is loaded. when the cache is not loaded there are no errors. so, to see if the cache was interfering with any other files, i went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them for a random string (in other words, i wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive). before i got through the c's dtg had detected at least six errors and recommended i reboot. does anybody, have any idea why smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive? oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in about every 100 files are affected. i originally posted this message to disk technician corp.'s system, but i figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out. -- internet: jdriver@netlink.cts.com (john driver) uucp: ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriver netlink online communications * public access in san diego, ca (619) 453-1115

why is win 3.1 sometimes so finicky? i have a new dell 486dx2/66mhz 8 megs ram. windows was working just great. i had a bus mouse and mother board problem. dell replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows and replaced the motherboard. just prior to this problem windows would ]only load up every other time. i would get the logo and either it would go on into windows or lock up. this was very consistent every other time. now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing. the computer is less than one month old. at first it worked fine! i can get into windows each time now with the win/s command. this forces standard mode. things seem to run slower. i mainly use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem..... plus it is slower. i re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing. should i first delete everything in all windows dir's? i did not because i have so much added in sub dir's etc. really puzzling why enhanced mode would not load each time but consistently every other time. standard mode each time...... any thoughts or comments ??? c-ya..... /\/\artin -- this communication is sent by /\/\artin university of arizona tucson ========================================================================= ak333@cleveland.freenet.edu mlinsenb@ccit.arizona.edu mlinsenb@arizvms death has been dead for about 2,000 years ****** follow the king of kings

i've been running dos 6 for about a month. i was generally impressed with the improvements: the multiple boot configurations were great, the new commands were nice, and doublespace worked fine (twice as slow for large data transfers, twice as fast for small with smartdrv). until now. this morning at 4 am while i was working on my research paper, i had to reboot a hung dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within windows 3.1. when my machine finished rebooting, i found my windows directory and about two thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted. i cannot afford problems like this. i'm returning to dos 5. mark p.s. i've also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should exist.

word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw. our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box. they overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless. i believe the character used by w4w is the period-centred (0183). this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this. i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w4w. altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!! is the w4w character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf? -- ____ russ sharp russ@deakin.edu.au ph (052)27 1141 fax (052)27 2015 \ / deakin university, school of engineering & technology, geelong, australia \/

hello again, about a week and one-half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers. specifically, a comparison between the canon bj200 (bubblejet) and the hewlett-packard deskjet 500. many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail i received. below is my original query and the responses i received. i have not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so you can extract what you find necessary. some people asked me for an unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer. there are a wide range of comments, each has its own value. there was no clear winner, some like the bj200 (especially its price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background). two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new printer to be introduced by hewlett-packard later this year (around summertime), and an addition to the epson product line (their first inkjet). you will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer). no one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will print, but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge). well, that's a brief research summary of my personal research. enjoy! =========================================================================== >hello fellow 'netters. > >i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i >should purchase, the canon bj200 (bubblejet) vs. the hp deskjet 500. i >thought, rather than trust the salesperson, i would benefit more from >relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest >potential. and, i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls >better than any salesperson. > >now, i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 >dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett-packard deskjet 500 (300 dpi). >which is faster?

i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here :-{. the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand. =========================================================================== about a month ago, i got a canon bj200. i absolutely love it. it is incredibly fast, except for printing from pspice (i don't know if you ever do stuff with that or not.) most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text. the only problems i've had are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on cheap paper (lots of streaks). normal copy paper works great with it, you can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve inches from your face. (that is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) the printer comes with its own driver for windows 3.1!! i have no other complaints. the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet. the teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--and, if you purchase it between now and may 31, you get a $50 rebate from canon!! i bought mine from a store called compusa, and the price now is $340. i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at. it also prints very well, and everyone has drivers for it, but it is very slow! hope i helped!

=========================================================================== altough i'm sometimes also a salesperson (if i'm not suppost to study :-)) i would recommend to buy the bj200. the printing quality is a bit better, but you you've got much more possiblities. don't forget the hp engine is at least 2 years on the marked, the canon engine (witch is also used in other "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the epson ones) is quite recently available.. > now, i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 > dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett-packard deskjet 500 (300 dpi). > which is faster? is there a noticeable print quality difference, > particularly in graphics? which will handle large documents better (75 i've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the bj200, one with the canon, the other with the hp, and.. there was a difference in printing- quality,.. the canon was a bit better.. greetz, kris =========================================================================== when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers. they have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet. we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj-200s. i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality. the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder, however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal). anyway, we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. out of 15 deskjets and 4 bj-200s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp. 							-nate =========================================================================== whenever i buy anything i look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. i've been unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so i've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers. i can't remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. i bought the 500c because of the added dimension of colour (i intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that). although i haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result. i note that even though you can now get the 550c (the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500c and 500 are still readily available (at least in the uk). the following are my views/experience: 	1.	i don't know anything about the canon except that i came away 		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with 		the idea that the hp offered the best performance/price ratio. 	2.	i believe hp are the originals in the field - not always the 		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes 		they have the expertise. 	3.	the 500c is worth the extra. operation in mono is perfectly 		acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from 		windows. 	4.	i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured 		typesetters (before their american owners closed them down!) 		and i can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is 		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor... 	5.	the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers. 	6.	if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack - it's pretty 		slow with it, god knows what it's like without! i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it's not in daily use. i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate. hope this is of use. regards david	 =========================================================================== just bought the bj-200. i thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with $50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the deskjet in print quality. speed: per page rate seems to be faster (i don't have figures). i don't print long docs, though. quality: i think the graphics quality is excellent. print quality is excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a laserjet. the 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page/print head in place, i would imagine. large docs: not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ... manual says up to 100, though. haven't tried it. drivers: no problems under win3.1 yet. winword doesn't want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does, though. know nothing of add-on costs. daniel a. hartung -- dhartung@chinet.chinet.com -- ask me about rotaract =========================================================================== >the deskjet is slow. this is in comparison to the other printers i >mentioned. i have no idea how the bubblejet compares. > >the interface between win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, i've not >had any problems with it. i just bought a bj-200 printer a couple of days ago. i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn't for me. the bj-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper). i don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry very fast. probably within a second. since canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of may, it is really a good buy. --- sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications =========================================================================== wow, it's funny you should ask this. i'm a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late. i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night. i was really worried that i wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is fantastic! i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality. you can't tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page. no problems with drivers. the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn't findi it under windows or wordperfect. it works well under both. i have yet to install word for windows so don't know how it works with them. i had a deskjet 500 at work last year. it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow. and much noisier than the bubblejet. i won't say the bubblejet is much better, but i really do like it more. just my $0.02 worth. -=- brett =========================================================================== -- sincerely, robert kayman	----	kayman@cs.stanford.edu -or- cpa@cs.stanford.edu "in theory, theory and practice are the same. in practice, they are not."

i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts. for instance, the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e is only about as "fast" as the isa diamond speedstar plus, which isn't what i would call "fast." i don't understand why eisa video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as local bus cards, given that eisa video cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of isa's 8 bits. since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board, such as a diamond speedstar 24x? from pc magazine's (i think) recent report, i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card, but it's around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend. and, for $500, i could get a diamond viper and still have $100 left over (of course, i'd have to get a local bus mother- board too...) can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration? thanks! christopher wroten, cfw@world.std.com

anyone know of a good software package that will allow us to keep track of who is printing what and when? is there any way to get print manager to keep a log? is there a print manager replacement that will do this? how about a package that will only allow access to the system for people in a password file? i looked at chastity, but it will let you log in without a password, and doesn't keep tabs of who got on and when. any help will be greatly appreciated. @===@ @===@ ### mark juric a.i. programs ### ### mjuric@ai.uga.edu university of georgia ### ### athens, georgia 30602 ### @===@ @===@

hi everybody out there, i just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of windowsnt and still am not able to boot up that system. the final step achieved is the display of io-error 0x0069. but, since this is the beta release of the sdk for nt and not of nt, microsoft does not include a manual on the os itself, explaining what this error means of what i can do to get rid of. my configuration is: mainboard hauppauge 4860-25, rev. a7 (a 486 with socket for i860) 28megs of memory (512k*36,1m*36,2m*36) ami eisa scsi controller (15series), latest bios, 16mb cache st41200n hard disk syquest 555 removable disk toshiba 3301 cd rom drive proaudio spectrum plus 16 longshine ethernet card lcs8634 (ne2000 comp.) et4000 graphics card, 1meg (colorimage5) the system is running fine under dos and windows 3.1 etc, but trying to do the setup for nt, - automatic setup does not recognize controller (aha1542-compat.) when adding manually, nt complains not finging any cd-rom drive - the manual setup (winnt) does not copy everything from cd to hd, does not recognize controller, but takes it manually. setup continues until it tries to boot. then it starts loading several stuff from disk (seems to fing the hd), but messing up with that damned io-error 69. i took away all io cards not essential, but that did not make any effect. anybody got any ideas? help would be greatly appreciated. michael linder mlinder@tonet1.physik.tu-berlin.de institute of optics tech. univ. berlin, germany

this may be an faq (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but i am getting frustrated and looking for help. i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when i close them. when i load windows i start with about 83% resources available but many of the application programs i run regularly (wpwin 5.2, vb 2.0, winqvt 2.8, lotus organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when i exit them. after a day or two of work i often find myself down under 50% of available resources even when i have no applications other than my shell running. i am aware this is a known problem; what i am looking for are some suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it. 1. what software is the culprit? win 3.1, ndw, my applications? are some modes of win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at plugging this leak? 2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak? 3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with this? seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like qemm. 4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside? (i was hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.) 5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources? 6. any other suggestions that i don't know enough to ask for specifically? thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me email. danny =========================================================================== daniel david mittleman - danny@arizona.edu - (602) 621-2932

i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrator's point of view. i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they (microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the local setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation". if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i'd like to hear it from administrators first. the local windows installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available). from a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup/a. then install windows on a per/machine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives. in this way, all drivers are available to the setup procedure w/o the need to change disks. advantages: - reduce traffic - running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files. - network independence - if the network fails (and they all do at one point or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time. - faster windows - theoretically, windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network. this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones. - a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation. disadvantages: - cost - installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space. workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. - administration - local windows installations are very difficult to administer. new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation. - security - users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance. this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations. - backup - we all know the problems backing up local hard disks. the backup sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly. backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all. this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and *not* user data. the shared windows installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup/a procedure described above. users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual "user" directories. these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory. the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their windows session. the user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her windows session. these include group files, .ini files and other regularly updated files. advantages: - a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. as an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. - assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories, the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as-needed to correct problems that may arise. this includes win.ini and system.ini. - backup of all pertinent files is done easily. even if the users' files are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates. disadvantages: - network traffic - since all windows files are being shared in a network directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows. - if the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since window's is reliant upon the network for its files. loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work. - although minimal, disk space is still a consideration. if the users' files are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone. - users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar. this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username (in the case of network user files). the discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to know, from other administrators with a large windows userbase, how they prefer setting up windows. personally, i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup. all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks. in fact, i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money. i would also like to see recommendations for applications. should apps such as word and/or excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed? again, i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket"; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt. now i am sure microsoft (and i know your out there) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with "actual" working experience with users and network administration.

i don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. here's my question: context: i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe (an ibm 3090 running vms/mvs), and log on to my account. when i installed slip on my computer, i had to configure it for my modem (14.4 kbs etronics internal) and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe. the way it works now is that i type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the dos prompt. uicvm is the node name of the mainframe. the program then dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon screen. "telnet" and "tn3270" are the names of batch files in my slip directory. i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session. problem: i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3.1 because i hardly ever use dos directly. slip will not run under windows. i talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that i use a packet driver called winpkt.com with slip. they gave me instructions on how to load it before i start windows, and how to modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files (in the slip directory) to ensure that it would work. i did all that and i could run slip from windows, but there were other problems. for one thing, slip would not hang up the phone when i exited. i had to run my communi- cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn't work. for another, there were too many errors. it often took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. our computer center does not support slip under windows, so i can't keep going back to them with more questions. question: is there some other shareware package that will run under windows and do what slip is supposed to do? i need a package that is not too expensive, which is why i am looking for shareware. i have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost hundreds of dollars. these are the main requirements: 1. must be able to run under windows 3.1 2. must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation 3. must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the mainframe allows. no y-modem or z-modem etc. i believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but i'm hazy about that. a subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true windows program (rather than a dos program modified to run under windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications. any information received is appreciated. pankaj saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu

has anyone observed this? if i copy a large, say 800k+ file (a large pkzip file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under ms windows 3.1 via either program manager or a dos shell, the file copied under the dos shell has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not. the corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after both copies. the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption. now here's the kicker: i have many windows open while doing this; both dos and windows apps. supposedly all windows' apps share the same time slice, whereas the dos apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden). so, as an example, i have 5 windows' apps open, 2 multitasking dos sessions running, and one execution-execlusive dos shell iconized (inactive). under this scenario, cpu time is divided into two major slices: one for all the windows apps and one slice for the running dos app. when copying under windows pgm mgr, i'll assume the other windows and dos tasks are essentially inactive. thus pgm mgr gets, say, 80% of the windows slice and 95% of the execution-background dos shell's slices. thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = .72 or 72% of the total available cpu time. when copying in a dos shell, i activate the execute-exclusive mode dos shell (no other dos background tasks allowed), full screen, under the windows task manager. the cpu time available to this shell would be 80% of the windows slice (assumming inactive windows applications) and 100% of the dos slice: (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available cpu time. so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu time? is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy? it must be! miscellaneous data: running windows on top of dos 5.0, qemm 5.x, rapidbios.sys, 2.0 mbyte smartdrive (no delayed writes), two ramdrives, logitech mouse driver 6.2, full 16mbytes motherboard ram, 64kbyte motherboard cache, 386 dx 33 mhz. running dos-edit.com tsr in the dos shell. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------- wayne long - oe215 internet: wcl@risc.sps.mot.com 6501 william cannon drive west uucp: cs.texas.edu!oakhill!risc!wcl austin, texas 78735-8598 phone (512) 891-4649 fax: 891-3818
somebody help me cure my poor computer before i go insane! i have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears to be memory-related. it's actually not limited to windows, but that's where it causes most of my problems. ths machine's 486dx33, 8meg ram, 256kcache, trident tvga card, pas-16 soundcard. 1) windows runs really, really slow most of the time. slower than on my old 386sx16. graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow, applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear. (note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that appear to be related. several run slow, my .mod player crashes the system etc..) 2) running borland c++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other programs) completely fixes the problem. windows will run as fast as i've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than when i don't run bc beforehand. 3) i don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys. installing emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse. after emm386 is installed, running bc will not fix the problem anymore. this problem is driving me nuts. if you think you can help, please reply through the mail. thanks, evan

when i use file manager's disk copy, i find that windows (3.1) can read the whole 1.2mb disk at one time, but only 98% of a 1.44 disk. it looks like a problem of memory. however, the pc has 4mb ram. there should be some way to allocat more extended memory for disk copy. please advise me on this matter. thanks in advance. huayong

regarding the horror stories about dos6/doubledisk and stacker 2.? killing hard drives: i was wondering if the dos 6 mirror command works on the doubled drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table. if it records the vital doubledisk info, then using it daily should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the type of catastrophic failure discussed. if it doesn't, then shame on microsoft.
hi, 	i've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988 keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching). it has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386 enhanced mode. this occurs in norton desktop, file manager, and when trying to install software. running win 3.1 in standard mode works fine. 	has anyone run into this? any ideas? much thanks appreciated. david yon@world.std.com

microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet i cannot think of even *one* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market before anyone else. xerox-parc/apple, osborne, next, gnu and others have been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing. what has microsoft done to be a technological leader? i posted this question before, but i got nary a reply. i make the challenge now to anyone who can come up with something-especially microsoft employees. i get no response this time, i guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what i suspect anyway. ###################################################################### kurt d. bollacker			duke university medical center kdb@sunbar.mc.duke.edu				 durham, nc 27710 ######################################################################

i know that i've seen this question asked before, but i don't remember seeing any answers..so here it is again: does any one know of an ftp site where the wd90c31 driver might reside? i've checked cica, and i'm sure it's not there (i'm refering to the new version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93). i have seen it on c-serve, but i hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless i really have to! alternativly, is it possible to get paradise (or wd) to mail me the new drivers, or don't they do that. finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is there not much improvement over my 10/92 version? thanks for the info, peter -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- peter st.wecker, n4yrj internet:pswecker@med.unc.edu (919) 966-1096 uucp:pswecker@uncmed.uucp dept. of physiology, univ. of north carolina, chapel hill nc

here's the situation: at home, i have ms word for windows but no printer. at work, i have windows + a postscript printer, but not ms word. so, i configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file, which i then bring to work. my question: how do i print this postscript file through the print manager at work? if, for example, i select print from the file manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish. i know that i can open a dos window and do: 	 copy file.ps com1: which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds. there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print manager, but if there is, i can't find any mention of it in the documentation. anyone know how to do this? -- michael clase memorial university of newfoundland mclase@riemann.math.mun.ca

has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you done to cure it? one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. from then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf again. the workstation is set up to share its discs etc. the machine is a 486dx/33, 8mb ram, with diamond stealth video. it behaves this way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a smc elite. it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver, rather than the diamond drivers.

hello cliff many people on the internet (like us) have to pay for every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups. bitmaps are large. bitmaps cost us a lot of money. there are special news-groups for bitmaps because of this. we don't subscribe to them. put you bitmaps in the right place. read one of the faq guides in the newuser groups and it will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of establishments like mine that you have just cost money. some of them have very limited budgets. go away. p.s. this is a flame ;-) p.p.s you distribution of "usa" didn't work. kenb -- ______________________________________ ____________ _____________ |ken blackler kb@jet.uk (+44)235 464743| | __________ | | -fusion- | |jet joint undertaking, abingdon | | | |_ | | |energy for the| |oxfordshire, england. ox14 3ea | | \_/ |_ | | | (far) future | - disclaimer: please note that the above is a personal view and should not be construed as an official comment from the jet project.

(what microsoft means by "device independent" is unclear to me.) four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit pixels. these images were intended for use on dos (ibm, or little-endian) systems. if	you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte- swap all short and long integer values. by convention, dib images end in the extension ".bmp". this is because 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 2 - they are a super-set of earlier "bitmap image files". consequently you will sometimes hear dib files referred to as "bmp" files. since dib images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors" of dib images: 	 o dos dib images. these are the recommended	 convention, and the 	 form which i will describe how to create.	 they are intended for 	 applications running under ms windows /3.0 in a dos environment. 	 o os/2 dib images. my understanding is that these are the	flavor 	 of dib images that were used by the presentation manager. 	 o old-style bitmap images. 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 3 - differences between flavors the dos dib images consist of: 	 1. a "bitmapfileheader" file header which identifies the file	 as a 	 dib file.	 this	header	also gives the total size of the image 	 file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2. a "bitmapinfoheader" image header which	 specifies the	 image 	 attributes. 	 3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. if it exists, 	 this may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. each entry is a windows 	 rgbquad structure. 	 4. the image data itself. the os/2 dib images consist of: 	 1. the same "bitmapfileheader" file header which identifies the file 	 as	 a dib	 file.	 this header also gives the total size of the 	 image file, and the offset to the image data. 	 2. a "bitmapcoreheader" image header which	 specifies the	 image 	 attributes. 	 3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. again, if this 	 exists it	 may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. each entry is a 	 windows rgbtriple structure. 	 4. the image data itself. the old style image bitmap consists of: 	 1. either a bitmapinfoheader or a bitmapcoreheader.	 which	header 	 type is determined by the first long integer (dword) value. 	 2. an optional color palette.	 this	palette	 may be composed of 	 either windows	rgbquad	 structures (if the	header	was a 	 bitmapinfoheader) or windows rgbtriple structures (if the	header 	 was a bitmapcoreheader). 	 3. the image data itself. creating dib image files. creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward	steps. the headers need to be created and then written to the file. these header structures are defined in the ms windows/3.0 "windows.h"	include	 file. palette information needs	 to be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit images. the five general steps are: 	 1. filling in the bitmapfileheader	 and	the bitmapinfoheader 	 structures the basic image information. 	 2. if the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating the 	 color palette of rgbquads. 	 3. calculating the total file size and putting this information in 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 4 - 	 the "bfsize" field of the bitmapfileheader. 	 4. calculating the offset to the image data from the	start of the 	 file, and putting this in the "bfoffbits"	field of the 	 bitmapfileheader. 	 5. writing to the file the bitmapfileheader,	the bitmapinfoheader, 	 the color palette, and the image data (in that order). the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c	 type- defined keywords.	the following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with microsoft c. 		 _______________________________________ 		 |					 | 		 | type-defined keywords in microsoft c.| 		 |______________________________________| 		 | typedef |	 meaning		 | 		 |_________|____________________________| 		 | byte |	 unsigned character	 | 		 | word |	 two byte unsigned integer | 		 | dword |	 four byte unsigned integer| 		 |_________|____________________________| 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 5 - the bitmapfileheader this structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader { 		 word	 bftype; 		 dword	 bfsize; 		 word	 bfreserved1; 		 word	 bfreserved2; 		 dword	 bfoffbits; 	 } bitmapfileheader; the "bftype" field is the two ascii characters 'b' and 'm'.	 this	serves to	identify the file as	 a dib	 image file. on an intel byte ordered machine (ibm or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in c as the quantity ('m' << 8 | 'b') == 0x4d42 on an intel system. the "bfsize" field is the total size of the file. for our	purposes this field is equal to: the size of the bitmapfileheader, plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times the	 size of a rgbquad, plus the number of bytes of image data.	if the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be calculated	ahead of time. otherwise, this field needs to be filled in later. both the "bfreserved1" and the "bfreserved2" fields are always set to zero. the "bfoffbits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file. for our purposes, this field should be set to:	 the size of	the bitmapfileheader,	 plus	 the size of the bitmapinfoheader, plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad. this works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists. 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 6 - the bitmapinfoheader this structure is defined in "windows.h" as: 	 typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader{ 		 dword	 bisize; 		 dword	 biwidth; 		 dword	 biheight; 		 word	 biplanes; 		 word	 bibitcount; 		 dword	 bicompression; 		 dword	 bisizeimage; 		 dword	 bixpelspermeter; 		 dword	 biypelspermeter; 		 dword	 biclrused;

	---or, in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure--- 		 bytes_per_line = (biwidth * bibitcount + 31 ) / 32 * 4; when writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first. the	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file. for 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as you	 would expect. one bit	images	are padded eight pixels to a byte. four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte. eight bit images are written one pixel per byte. twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel. however, for 24-bit images the information must be	 written out in the order blue, green, red. while most image file formats write data out in 			 march 15, 1991 				 - 8 - an "rgb" ordering, a dib image file	 writes	 the data out	 in an	 "bgr" ordering. summary this should provide enough information	to create dib	 images	 from applications such	as scanners or for image exporting routines.	if you find out any more about dib images, please pass the information on	to me so that i can modify this document accordingly. 			 march 15, 1991 -- thomas b. kinsman, rochester, ny, thomas@acadia.kodak.com "practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty."	-anon -- 			ito takayuki <yuki@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp> 			senior, department of infomation science, 			faculty of science, university of tokyo, japan.
i have a very funny yet confusing problem. i am using telemate within win 3.1. everytime i close dos box, my telemate operation get affected (normally i am doing file transfer). however, if i open + close windows program everything seems running smoothly. my file transfer operation get affected only if i close dos box. can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to fix it?? thanks in advance glenn jayaputera
a friend of mine uses windows 3.1 to do most of her work. unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven't been able to figure out how to change the default font used by the system and application menus, or the font used by the help program (what use is hypertext if you can't read it?) to make it legible to her. if anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts, of any software package that makes windows more accessible to visually handicapped people, please let me know. thanks, 	dan

i've been using final from coda for some time, but suddenly it stopped using my fonts. i have a 386 pc with lots of disk space and memory, a postscript laser, win3.1, finale 2.0.1 and i recently installed atm 2.0. i've been fiddling around with the windows setup for some time, and when i needed to do some work with finale things didn't print properly. it might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of atm from 1.something to 2.0, but i don't have the old atm lying around anomore. the most annoying problem was that the petrucci font didn't print, which is a rather important font :-) i managed to get direct printing to work if i included ownps=0 in the [finale] section of win.ini, but compile postscript listing still doesn't work; and it's those .eps files i need. when i look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is courier. i found out that if i manually changed the courier 24-point to petrucci 24-point in the .eps file everything worked ok, but i'd rather avoid that since i have a lot of songs to work with. and yes, in the special/font/font names dialog box all the fonts i need are listed, with the correct mapping between finale, screen and printer fonts. finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well (that is, after i included ownps=0), and all my other windows applications print petrucci and the other fonts well. has anyone encountered problems like this? what is the current version of finale from coda music software? i have 2.0.1 are the people at coda available on internet or x.400? i'd be grateful for all hints and help. -mats -- internet: mats@gar.no quikcomm: mats@gar#@genor serverp: mats garp x.400: g=mats; s=tande; o=oslo; p=gr; a=telemax; c=no;

	i'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a novell network (using shell version 3.22, i think). the workstation, a 386, was set up to run windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. needless to say, i'd like to upgrade it to windows 3.1, and have it work with the network. 	basically, the windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but several dos applications, like word perfect, will be on the network. i'd mainly want windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and perhaps handle some network functions as well. if i could multitask the dos apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but i could live without it. 	eventually, i'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working with the network and windows 3.1 as well. (however, most of the terminals are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much dos-bound, and i guess that leaves out windows for workgroups.) and in the future, maybe there'd be norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself. 	as you can guess, i've never done anything like this before. i've read through the networks material that came with windows, but still, i'd like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area. 	please reply by email. i don't scan these newsgroups often. 	thanks for any replies. brian "rev. p-k" siano revpk@cellar.org "well, i'll know right away by the look in her eyes she's lost all illusions and she's worldly wise, and i know if i give her a listen, she's what i've been missing, what i've been missing i'll be lost in love and havin' some fun with my cynical girl who's got no use for the real world, i'm looking for a cynical girl" --- marshall crenshaw, "cynical girl"

i've started getting a message from windows 3.1 whenever i try to execute a dos program from windows, either thru the program manager or the file manager. a message box comes up and says "this program or one of its components is compressed. use the ms-dos expand command to expand the file." now, i know this is bogus, because i can always execute the program from dos when not running windows. the program in question is command.com (yup, the basic dos command line shell...) and, the expand command tells me that the file is already expanded. all my windows apps work just fine - i only get this message when trying to execute a dos program from windows. clues anyone? thanks!! christopher wroten, cfw@world.std.com
i'm writing a mail management system using word for windows 2.0 as a front end. the user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as "foo.txt ." i've set up an autoexec macro in winword to load "foo.txt" ok, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems. what i'd really like to do is to create an autoexit macro in winword that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ." in other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on may 1 at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and "foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my autoexec macro points to it. my main question is this: how may one rename a file from within a wordbasic macro to include a time/date variable in the new filename? thanks- ======================================================================= "if you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking a beer, i bet it makes beer shoot out of your nose." -- jack handey ----------------------------------------------------------------------- erich w. lantz | ewl@world.std.com | timberville, va | dod #0815 =======================================================================

well, i've come into some money and want to buy cd-rom, sound board and speakers. i have not kept up on any material relating to sound boards and cd-rom's because until now i never thought i'd have enough money. so can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good package including cd-rom, sound, and speakers (and software i suppose)... or since i don't really need the cd-rom right now give me some good ideas for sound boards and speakers. those i could really use now. i have looked at soundblaster pro, which costs about as much as i think i want to spend on a board (~$120), and i've looked at the gravis sound board, which is about $140 and i don't know the adv/disadv of either of these boards. right now i want to use it with any games that support sound, and to use in windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there. so any concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would be greatly appreciated. if anyone else is interested in this info i would be glad to summarize responses and post. and if this is some type of faq please point me in the right direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth. thanks! -=- brett -- brett watson, database/system administrator kansas supreme court - topeka, ks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

i am working with visual basic v2.0 for windows. specifically, i am working on an application that generates formatted reports. since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is: 1. is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in visual basic/windows beyond the 64k limit? as i have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get around the above problem, i am working on the following approach: i am trying to create my own defined template in ms-word, using the wordbasic macros so that i can open up word from visual basic(vb) and load this template of mine, which will work in the following way: it will first open myown.ini file (created in vb - at the time when the user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the .ini file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .ini file. 1. when using the getprofilestring function in wordbasic, is there a way to specify/change the default .ini file (which is win.ini) to myown.ini file? 2. when using the file input$ function in wordbasic - is there a way to read more than the 32k at one time? --- any help will be appreciated. pgupta@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
i'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs. a couple of issues ago, pc mag listed as editor's choices both conversion artist and hijaak for windows. anyone have any experience with those or some others? i'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and i'm not making much progress with the screen shots. :^( i'm currently using dodot and i'm about to burn it and the disks it rode it on. it's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving me crazy. tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a tiff file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left and right sides of the picture [!]. usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard (so i have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so. the one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option. you'd think that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say, 256 colors to 16 colors. but if you go from 256 or 16 colors to b&w, you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white. for me, this is useful because i can turn light grays on buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the 3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window. if you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less buggy!) program can do this as well? much thanks for any help. ---------------------------------signature--------------------------------- david delgreco | "what lies behind us and what lies technically a writer | before us are tiny matters compared delgreco@rahul.net | to what lies within us." | - oliver wendell holmes -- david f. delgreco <delgreco@rahul.net>

seen from a typographically point of view, atm using postscript fonts is better than truetype; the hinting mechanism incorporated in ps is gorgeous. multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a ps font as problematically; they may have better use of the unicode features of tt fonts (in windows nt). i've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size ps fonts; i haven't seen those as tt fonts. most of them are rendering quite inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts). simply compare timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font; the first looks better. i am hoping that there will be atm/nt ! -- claudius mokler e-mail mokler@desert.in-berlin.de

********************************************************************** --> changes in version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9) 	in this version, we have revised cosy_pak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v2.1. since mathematica 2.1 provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. this has made cosy_pak smaller. thus brian evans' signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosy_pak v0.81 are no longer needed directly by cosy_pak v0.9. for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing (available at the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or ip # 130.207.226.24). on the downside, the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its previous version. ***********************************************************************	 --> for mathematica 2.0 users 	 	we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in the directory `for_2.0'. please move all files and directory under for_2.0 into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. ************************************************************************** 	 --> introduction this is an unsupported release of cosy_pak - a control systems analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using mathematica 2.1. classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a next (tm) computer (a unix based workstation). they have been used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control engineering texts (ogata [1991], phillips and harbor [1991]) for undergraduate courses in `control engineering i' taught at the systems engineering department of cwru. in addition to the next, they have also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm), and, ibm pc's (tm) running ms windows(tm). we would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above. ibm users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics. once installed (see below for instructions), this collection of mathematica packages can be loaded by any user. bundled with the packages are many notebooks ("cosy_notes") which demonstrate the functionality of these packages. the notebooks follow a plan of many fine, standard, undergraduate control engineering text books listed in the references. examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the various references given at the end of this file. the contents of the notebooks in the "cosy_notes" directory are given below. ----------- begin "cosy_notes" contents

unix machine if you have unzip utility on it. uncompressing and untarring "cosy_pak_09.tar.z" or unzipping "cosy_pak_ibm_09.zip" will create a directory called "cosy_pak". 	 once the files are expanded you should see a single directory "cosy_pak" containing the following three files, four sub-directories and their contents: sub-directories in "cosy_pak": cosypak - contains control tool box packages manual - cosy_pak manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. cosy_notes - contains notebooks for_2.0 - contains laplace transform package from mathematica 2.1 		for mathematica 2.0 users.

the "cosy_notes" directory. to use the notebooks, move the directory `cosypak' to a directory that mathematica can recognize : 	 /locallibrary/mathematica/packages 	on a unix machine, my_harddisk:mathematica:packages 	on an apple macintosh, c:\winmath\packages 	on an ibm pc. 	at the beginning of the "initialization" cell of each notebook in "cosy_notes" directory, we list the example about how to make mathematica identify the directory: 	(* initialization of path *) 	(* example for a unix machine (default) *) 	(* 	$path=join[$path, 	{"/locallibrary/mathematica/packages"}]; 	*) 	 	(* example for an apple macintosh *) 	(* 	$path=join[$path, 	{"my_harddisk:mathematica:packages"}]; 	*) 	 	(* example for ibm pc 	 	 *) 	(* 	$path=join[$path,	 	 {"c:\winmath\packages"}];	 	*)	 change the pathname according to your machine by removing the mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$path' setting. 	this command makes mathematica recognize the directory /locallibrary/mathematica/packages 	on a unix machine my_harddisk:mathematica:packages 	on a apple macintosh c:\winmath\packages 	on an ibm pc --> mathematica 2.0 users 	 	we include the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in the directory for_2.0. please move all files and directory under for_2.0 into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. --> getting started after installation, start mathematica and open the notebooks in the "cosy_notes" directory. all notebooks load their own packages. navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. ibm users however will have to evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics. *************************************************************** --> user responsibilities we request you to take a few minutes and fill out

i've got an old super vga card manufactured by sampo of taiwan and i'm looking for a windows 3.1 driver for it. it's based on the cirrus logic cl-gd510a-32pc-b chip. i've contacted the suppliers here in new zealand and they say that only windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer. so if there's a v3.1 driver out for this chip set i'd like to know - preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz thanks is advance ross james
as the title says...does anyone know of a text editor (like notepad) that can handle large text files?....thanx for any and all help! ________________________________________________________________________ | james burke | by reading this you agree not to hold | | | the writer responsible for any evil | | jburke@abacus.bates.edu | happening that may befall you at any time. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------

i have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode. for bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted. the rest of the desktop is fine. for wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, i have no problem. i have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no problems with, so it is possible. it is also possible to display these bitmaps using cshow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video card is not at fault. how can i remedy this? my system: 386dx40, 4mb ram. dos 6.0, windows 3.1. oak 1mb 077 video card, 1024x768x256 mode, using supplied drivers. windows has a permanent 11,288kb swap file. please reply via e-mail, and _use the address in my .sig_, as our post software always seems to mangle the address in the header. thanks, mazz. -- richard mazzaferri ph.d. student uni. of newcastle ph (049) 216254 mazz@faceng.newcastle.edu.au australia.

hello, i want a little network for 3 users. all users want to run windows. the most important things i want for the network are: file-sharing, mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem card on one of the computers. we all want to use each others harddisk. my idea was to buy three computers (one 486dx and two 386dx). all three have a 40mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large harddisk. all three also have a network card. the 486 is connected to the printers and contains the fax/modem card. and last but not least: workgroups for windows. my questions: - is this possible? - what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups for windows? - will all the computers be fast enough? behind all three, someone is working. thanks, martijn
last night i tried to reinstall the utilities from the windows 3.1 resource kit disk. the setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it had finished, there was no program group created. now, i know i've done this before successfully, and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax me, but i'm curious as to what might be going on. i can only assume that something left over from the last time i had it installed is getting in the way, but i can't figure out what. any clues, anyone? -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- david eastwood / sybase inc., emeryville, ca / eastwood@sybase.com

i solved my problem. i still do not understand why it happens ths way; perhaps some of you c++ gurus can explain this to all of us! for some reason when i define the following functins in the class definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual functions are not defined. when i placed these two in a separate source file and compiled them, the problem went away. any ideas what happen? are the functions that are defined in the class construct all inline ? is this the problem? virtual int isequal (const object _far &obj) const { return this == &(hashentry&) obj; } virtual void printon( rostream os) const { os << "[ hwindow is " << (void _far *) hwindow << " ]\n"; } -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- - bowden wise computer science dept, rensselaer polytechnic inst, troy, ny 12180 internet: wiseb@cs.rpi.edu
hiyas all, upon getting animated desktop for windows as a gift from my boyfriend, i couldn't wait to install it. i had gotten an advertisement for it and put it aside with my list of 'i wants.' after installing the software, it didn't load. no part of the software would load even though the install went seemingly well. 	i called deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty million different questions about my system.. concluded that i had one of the systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. of course they're willing to give me my $$$ back.. what a waste of time and energy. the folks on their support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings of windows 3.1. 	after my experience with the installation of the sb 16, i learned some of the function of windows dll files. before sending back desktop animator, decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of .dll files i had. i had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 100k the other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied with desktop animator). i moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll to a directory outside my path. (for some reason, i had the older cpalette.dll in my windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) when i did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. does anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions for trouble-shooting? ____ / \__ darla |\ / @ \ \ \_______| \ .:|> portal: darla@shell.portal.com \ ##| | \__/ darla@cup.portal.com | ####\__/ \ aol: kuby2u@aol.com / / ## \| darlaiam@aol.com / /__________\ \ wix: darla |genie: kuby l_jj \__jj

is there a hot-key for the windows 3.1 screen saver utility? if not, is there an easy way to create one? the reason that i need one is that my dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly secure). also, the system manager won't let any software be added so another program such as lock32.zip from cica or a different screen saver is out. thanks for any and all help. -- chris putnam (still a blue devils lover at heart) euphonium/baritone star in '93???

i'd like to appeal to the net's nt wizards for a bit of advice. first a general description of the machine as follows: motherboard: utron 33 mhz opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache (soon i hope to drop a dx2 chip into it) fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256) proaudio spectrum 16 sound board primary disk = connor cp30174 on a caching ide controller secondary disk = conner cp30174 as slave on same controller tertiary disk = fujitsu ??? 650 meg on superstore esdi controller planned future disks include scsi hd and cd rom on pas16 scsi port tape drive is a colorado jumbo 250 on the floppy controller future tape drive may be a dat on the scsi interface. other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board (ugly dos software drives the latter) applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, quicken and turbo pascal/windows) but the important stuff is my audio work environment which includes turtle beach wave for windows, mcs stereo, and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files. also i use stacker on the primary drive, hp newwave (for my wife's use, and she won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called infinite disk from chili pepper software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline files. i plan to upgrade to nt, when it becomes a released product. i was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on, but i don't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta software. i expect to buy it, tear off the shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (i know, unrealistic, but i can hope can't i, after all, i have work to do). the advice i want concerns the state of nt regarding device drivers, and hardware specific stuff in general. how smoothly can i expect the upgrade to go? can i expect support for all my stuff, or do i still need to scramble around downloading drivers (pas?, orchid?, colorado?) from some bbs, etc. what steps should i take to ensure the installation goes smoothly. note that i want to nuke dos totally from the system. i'm allergic to command lines! i plan to run a "pure" nt system. also, will nt communicate with the workgroups lan? what about stacker? i currently have stacker on the first disk drive. without stacker, and the infinite disk product, i will have great difficulty fitting everything i have on the system (it's cramped now). i realize stacker will be incompatible with nt, but will there be an nt version? or will nt support compression a la dos 6? i know infinite disk will be incompatible with nt, but will they offer (or does anybody else) a comparable product for nt and at what cost? (perhaps i need to ask chili pepper that question) i can live without id if i have to, but i'd rather not. will nt run my dos apps (the teletext board mainly) without dos on the system? what do i need to keep around? any feedback or advice (including "forget nt" with good reasons) is much appreciated. my only significant reason for moving to nt is i need a better multitasking environment than windows (among other reasons, wave locks up the machine for hours and hours doing dsp processing on large audio files), and i want better lan support than i now have (internet access, etc). maybe there are better solutions than nt and if so, i would appreciate hearing about them (os/2? what's it's status these days?) pls respond by email and if there is interest i'll summarize for the net. thanks, nathan gregory p00211@psilink.com

less than 1/2 of mailorder price! i have three libraries, all on cd, which cost me over two thousand dollars mail order. they are all genuine, high quality eps vector graphics (not just some scans with a silly eps wrapper!) they are: 1. totem graphics color eps library (about 1400 color eps images). this costs a thousand bucks mailorder. i rate this clip art as high quality (much better than dynamic graphics clip art, sotmc clip art, etc., in my opinion), but i rate both the 3g library and the c.a.r. library as higher. totem's art is all color -- whereas most of the other's are b&w. it's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion. 2. c.a.r. graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size). this costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. i rate this clip art as very high quality, but it's only b&w. 3. 3g graphics library (very popular in all the mac mags). this costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. i rate this clip art as very high quality (got some awards in one of the major mac mags, forgot which). some of the images are color, but most are b&w. for what it's worth, all three of the cd's are saved in multiple file formats. they are readable on mac's and pc's. additionally, totem's will mount native- next also, although the next could just as easily mount either the mac or pc filesystems. i've personally tested the cd's on all three machines (i've owned all three machines, although i sold my next a few months ago). also, in my opinion, the 3g and c.a.r. libraries are the best in the business (and i've seen lots). also, totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color library around, although i like 3g's color art better. i want $850 for everything. can ship certified check c.o.d., as well as visa/mc charge. if you pay by visa/mc, i'll ship pre-paid in the continental u.s. if i ship c.o.d., buyer pays freight and c.o.d. fee. reason for selling: no longer have dtp business. please respond via email or telephone, as i rarely check these news groups. nevin email: npratt@glacier.sim.es.com voice: (h) 265-8949 (w) 582-5847 x6420

after hearing endless debate (read: name-calling) over which os is better, dos and windows or os/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple of different operating systems, i have decided to put the two products to a head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. i have, however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont really do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but os/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to. i have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and i was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information, as i would like, once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs. ->robbie<- z_shererrg.sfasu.edu
hi. one of my coworkers is having a very odd problem. his mouse works fine in dos applications, if you load them from the c: prompt. under windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move. even if you load a dos app under windows, the mouse doesn't work. the computer is a zeos 386sx-20 w/diamond speedstar vga running ms dos 5.0 and windows 3.1. mouse driver is microsoft's 8.2. i've tried switching the mouse from com1 to com2, i've tried a different mouse, i've reinstalled mouse.drv, and i can't get the blamed thing to work. the only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional parallel and serial port. could that cause the problem? thanks in advance for any help. -- carl fink carlf@panix.com c.fink4 (genie) "if you can't laugh at yourself, then you can bet that everyone else is doing so." - ed johnston

(this is difficult to reproduce, but it goes away totally when join is not used.) i think this is a windows problem, rather than mks's, since it works ok under raw dos. so, i would suggest that you can use join, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like. wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? unfortunately, join won't let you do it. there was talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drives, but i don't remember the source. it's too bad the join command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters. i realize that messdos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. but, it looks like ms is going to carry this over into windows nt (another os meant for casual, even igorant users -- not!). with all it's old family system baggage, maybe ms needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(. -- jerome (jerry) schneider domain: jls@atg.com aspen technology group uucp: {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls po box 673, ft. collins, co 80522 voice: (303) 484-1488

[ lots of stuff deleted because i felt like it ] this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value. i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of ms products do not even know about internet, and unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know. and the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors. while pc users tend to customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their command line. so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize quality. ms has made their life easier, and more productive and to them that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception. face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users. brian -- disclaimer: the opinions expressed are mine not those of bnr. ____________________________________________________________________________ | brian, ws1s (st/tt user/developer) | if i wanted a computer to play games | | bell northern research | on i'd buy an amiga. however i have | | research triangle park, nc | real work to do. so please get lost! | |____________________________________|_______________________________________|

i posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy. well, i think i know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the mouse. it seems to be the video driver! here's why i think that: a few weeks ago i helped a guy install the driver for his s3 video card for windows. he had been using the normal windows default vga driver. we don't have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off- brand serial mouse). his mouse worked fine until i installed the s3 (v1.4) driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too! is there anything i can do? i need high resolution since i display lots of stuff on my screen (ami pro, pegasus mail for windows, wp office 4.0 -- sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more). i noticed there are s3 drivers on ftp.cica, but they are the same version that i already have and they are no help (i already tried!). --- sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications d-406 hfac brigham young university provo, ut 84602 (801)378-3292 hfac_csr@byu.edu ecktons@ucs.byu.edu

i really think you are comparing apples and oranges. nobody disputes that os/2 has more big os features. the question is does an individual need the power. the sales of windows vs os/2 answer that question. the next question is even if i did want to run os/2 and i had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work. go to your local computer store to answer this one. i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os2/2.1. this is where the new battle lines will be drawn. windows 3.1 has won the single user pc war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are nt, os2/2.1, unix and netware 4.0. granted these os's will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii' of the war. who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure is fun watching and arguing about it tho. thx dave l

i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to re-install everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't i?!). i am using a windows-based backup program (actually norton), and i began wondering about the logic of this. sure, if i accidentally delete a file, i can get it from the archive. but what if my disk crashes again? i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program! (note, by crash, i mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine from booting properly. i think i gave up too early, but i didn't have the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was. my hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. yeah right...) this whole scenario is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker. so i think there are 2 possibilities: 1) i'm right. if my disk really crashes, i would at least have to re-install dos and windows to get the backup program working. 2) i'm wrong. there is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk that can easily restore it's state from scratch. the polls are open... tom ioerger univeristy of illinois, cs grad student ioerger@cs.uiuc.edu

my windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry. whenever i try to run windows now, the logo comes up ok, but when it tries to enter windows itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong graphics mode or something. it's completely illegible although functional as i can still exit to dos with an alt-e return combination. i tried to reinstall windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the installation process, install takes you into windows and there my graphics problem surfaces again so i cannot complete the re-installation. all this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before this problem cropped up. i'm running a 486-33dx with a diamond stealth vram (i've resinstalled the stealth video drivers again but with no luck). i'm also using qemm and stacker 3.0 but windows is installed on an un-stacked partition. and of course, it worked perfectly before. any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated. thanks. -hutch-

here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server. the winhelp() function, as i am told by ms, does search your path so relocating ms windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has hardcoded the path into their code so that when winhelp is invoked it searches the given path (i.e. winhelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then winhelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory where you have installed your software. i tested this out on a variety of software packages. i moved all my helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement. here is the results for different software packages: norton desktop			found helpfiles windows v3.1 for workgroups	found helpfiles windows v3.1			found helpfiles ms powerpoint v3.0		found helpfiles ms word				found helpfiles ms excel v4.0a			did not find helpfiles (strange) ms foxpro v2.5 for windows	found helpfiles lotus amipro v3.0		did not find helpfiles procomm plus for windows	did not find helpfiles i guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to specify a global path for helpfiles. if anyone has any comments or if i can help anyone or if i left something out please let me know. 		lhighley@gozer.idbsu.edu thanks for the help from everyone especially jagrant@emr1.emr.ca more info on this topic as it develops

i have just added a panasonic kp-x1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. i installed the appropriate windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but i'm unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. what appears to be happening is that the truetype fonts don't get printed properly. my experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from corel draw) print ok. graphicsworkshop for windows happily prints gifs etc. ms notepad and ms write will print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. when i print truetype fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. if i change the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated. i have tried using printer drivers for printers which the kx-p1123 (snappy name) emulates, namely epsom lq-850 and ibm proprinter x24 and the same problem occurs. if there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, i would be most chuffed. david h.

(i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week. if you do get multiple copies, my apologies.) here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of "upgrading" to dos 6 that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it. my envorinment ============== ti travelmate 4000 winsx (486sx/25) 4m ram 120m disk system bios version 1.03 05/21/92 by texas instruments cl-gd6420 vga bios v 1.03 a1 by cirrus logic & quadtel advance power manager battery.pro v b6.00 by texas instruments smart drive cache (win3.1/dos6) parameters: 2048 1024 a- b- windows benchmark winbench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by zd labs after "updgrading" to dos 6, i could not understand why certain things became so slow, especially after i decided to try 'dblspace'. in the process of finding out why, i discovered some interesting things. disk performance with double space and smart drive ================================================== while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain applications appeared to run very much slower. what was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards. i suspected double space (ds) and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbench(tm). the real disk winmark of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from factory with dos 5 and windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to dos 6 with ds. thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something. specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, ds actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because cpu being faster than i/o, more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in i/o cycles). however, for all other cases, particularly large random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long. while the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on winbench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed. the tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see winbench) and with smartdrv on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i/o'. this explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long. double space and windows ======================== dblspace will not run at all from within windows, not even if you wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that matter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get. how narrow minded can a programer get, i wonder. yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed floppy! (use the dos 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to.) dos 6 defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm ============================================== defragmentation seemed to take too much time. even so, i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm. this confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120m drive should take no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters i have used) but it took 12 minutes. i discovered that if i moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly). it dawned on me that this had to do with ti's battery saver advanced power management (apm) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle, and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process! after disabling the ti's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds. microsft programmers think ti4000 and gateway nomad users are idiots ==================================================================== in the readme.txt file, you can find the the following 	running microsoft backup with ti4000 and gateway nomad computers 	---------------------------------------------------------------- 	to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup 	for windows or ms-dos, add a /l0 switch to the device command in 	your config.sys that loads the battery.pro file. or, before you 	run microsoft backup, type setpower /l0 at the command prompt. if you checked ti's manual on the /l0 option, you will realise that it means "disable all power saving features of your notebook". why would anyone want to run a driver disabled! as i have found out, not only does ti's power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what else) are crippled by the ti's power saver. it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications. if there indeed is such a thing, then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications. you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots. by the way, if you run the advance power management utility, power.exe in dos6, when you check the status, it says: 	power management status 	----------------------- 	setting = adv: max 	cpu: idle 60% of time. this figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing (windows with only program manager in iconised form). does that mean that windows takes up 40% of my cpu all for itself, and that i have at best only 60% left for useful work? is such an overhead justified (whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface)? (in dos alone, it reports 99% idle time.) looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times! microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this: 	set path=c:\dos 	... 	set path=c:\etc\bin;%path%;c:\bin 	... 	set path=c:\etc\windows;%path%;c:\windows 	... 	set path=%path%;c:\bcc\bin 	... 	set path=%path%;%mouse% even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one (i.e. c:\dos), dos 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement, and prepends c:\dos to its value. as a result, my resultant path has so many dos's. if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path, and add the new dos path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path. (even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.) instead, the microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one) decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value. i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process. i started a thread on this when dos 4 came up, and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster. in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet. now that has not changed one bit. in fact, if you have a path statement with %path% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason? as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- i had the mouse driver invoked as: 	set mouse=c:\etc\mouse 	set path=%path%;%mouse% 	loadhigh %mouse%\mouse.com guess what memmaker did? it replaced the last statement with 	lh ... c:\etc\mouse\mouse.com why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters, without touching the rest of the line, i do not understand. dos 6 software quality ====================== dos 6 is the only operating system i know, in which, under normal usage, you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it. i am deliberately being cryptic about this: i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it. if they dont within a week, i will post how you can create this "ghost" file. surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice, i am sure two dozen microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what i was told how microsoft "tests the quality" of their products. i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to "test quality" when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but can only be built into the product. no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair! also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the defragmenters. i got my io.sys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk. this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since. microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your ds has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we should watch out for if we have already used ds. jaya -- dr. jayasooriah cse, cs&e, unsw | sign in a paris hotel: p.o. box 1, kensington, nsw 2033 | tel/fax: +61 2 697-5683/313-7987 | "a sports jacket may be worn to dinner, internet: jayas@vast.unsw.edu.au | but not trousers." dr. jayasooriah cse, cs&e, unsw | sign in a norwegian cocktail lounge: p.o. box 1, kensington, nsw 2033 | "ladies are requested tel/fax: +61 2 697-5683/313-7987 | not to have children internet: jayas@vast.unsw.edu.au | in the bar."

hello netters 	i recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer. the other day, i bought the computer shopper mag. i was looking through printer review section and noticed the winprinter800. the machine is incredibly low priced for all the features it has 			800 dpi! 			8meg ram 			postscript compatable 			envelope printing my question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so cheap? i would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge on this subject. thanks alot! 					dave ------------------------------ donuts are a girls best friend ------------------------------

does anyone have any information or better, first-hand experience, of the new epson bubblejet printer - stylus 800?? i'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under windows; i presume that a special printer driver is required - is it supplied as standard? is it able to print everything that a standard postscript laserprinter could?? many thanks for any replies - george george bolt, dept of psychology, univ of york, uk

i have a 486/33 vlb machine, with a wang 96/24 fax/modem. when using the windows terminal application, the only way i can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to com2, then go back and change it to com4. then it works fine. (i have it set to com4 as the port to use) i don't have anything plugged into com2, and i've looked over the manual for all it's worth, but what am i missing? the modem is jumpered for com4/irq3, which i understand means i can't use the second serial port and the modem at the same time, but i'm not using the second serial port anyway. also, when using procomm + for dos, it always sees the modem and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end answers. don't know if that helps any. thanks, brian d. reed bdr@cbnewsg.cb.att.com

windows shareware monthly (wsm) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best windows 3.x and nt shareware/freeware software. wsm is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single windows .hlp (help system) file. all types of software may be submitted for entry in wsm - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc. wsm benefits windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users. those searching for specific windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information. windows software authors may submit entries to windows shareware monthly in the following manner: 1. compose a short summary of the function of the software. include all special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart from other programs in the genre. be sure to include specific details such as: the current release version, where the software is available, how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any special requirements (e.g. sound card, or vbrun200.dll, etc.), how the author may be contacted, etc. because text is highly compressible, the summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it short. a good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480 resolution. order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired. all submissions whould be in plain text (ascii) format. formatting will be exactly as it is submitted - i will simply cut and paste text files into a help authoring system. if you require special formatting conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size, indicate so clearly within the text file. for best results, use windows notepad to create the .txt file. 2. include up to 100k of windows-format .bmp (bitmap) screen-shots which display the workings or special features of each program. special cases (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may submit up to 250k of .bmp files - all other should observe the 100k limit and use 16-color format. for maximum compatiblity with the software which will be used to create the wsm .hlp file (stefan olson's help writer's assistant for windows), please save the bitmaps with windows paintbrush or wingif. 3. include a 16-color .bmp of the program's icon (.ico file). many programs are available to convert .ico to .bmp format, or windows paintbrush may be used. the .bmp will be embedded in the summary text. 4. double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc. 5. compress the .txt file, the .bmp of the program icon, and any additional .bmps into a single file using pkzip (any version). 6. submit the entry by uuencoding the .zipfile, and e-mailing it to: daa7365@tamuts.tamu.edu if submitting via the internet or compuserve. if submitting via america online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .zip file, then e-mail to: diegoaa 7. if any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete the above procedures again. send all submissions to the @tamuts address, and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to daa7365@rigel.tamu.edu. all entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of wsm. the editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries. wsm is not limited to shareware/freeware software. a special area will be devoted to commercially available windows 3.x and nt software. commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .txt file and .bmps may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines). there is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries. advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations. there is no charge for advertising space. the first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints. wsm is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within wsm. a c/c++ programing section, a visual basic section, and two windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned. all work will be on a voluntary basis. if you wish to aid wsm and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at daa7365@tamuts.tamu.edu or diegoaa on america online. the first edition of wsm will be distributed may 1st via america online, compuserve, and the internet. the deadline for submissions is april 28th. the first edition filename will be wsm-1.zip, with each subsequent monthly release continuing in the series naming convention (wsm-2.zip, etc.). each edition will be released on the first of each month, and the deadline for submission will be at least three days before release.

i am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and i have a few question about microsoft's office pack. 1) i was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the office pack--winword, power point, excel, and ccmail--complete and the latest addition? 2) are the programs "hobbled" in any way? 3) can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from excel 4.0 to excel 5) ? 4) do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation? 5) is there anything that i should be aware of that makes the office package less of deal that it seems? sorry if i seem skeptical put the price for the office package--$439.39 on the street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first computer and software. but all four complete programs for less than $450 makes me just a little suspicious. maybe its just me. thanks for your help in advance kirt wilson northwestern university ------------------------------- internet: kwilson@casbah.acns.nwu.edu bitnet: kwilson@casbah

we have a lan where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. for the moment we are only working on mac and dos/windows. the department has always used sneaker net to transport files to the mac, since it requires a filter to strip out the <lf> characters. until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. we are now trying to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will allow us to share files across pc and mac platforms. i understand that pvcs used to do this, but that they no longer support the mac product (anyone know why ?? polytron ?). i have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so i assume that ours is not a new problem. who has had to deal with it ? what solutions have you come up with? thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or email. if there are enough email responses then i will post a synopsis of the knowledge. -charles emmons -- charles emmons | charles@trintex.uucp | these opinions are prodigy services co. | charles%trintex@uunet.uu.net | mine alone, unless white plains ny 10601 | voice 914-993-8856 | you would like to prodigy id - kjrd82a | fax 914-993-8659 | share them.
as a beginer, i just wonder how to transfer files from the sun system (which is on the network) to my pc at home (not connected to the network). i tried to use 'comit' to do so, but it was very slow and it seemed that getting multiple files at the same time was impossible. could anybody give me some hints & infomation? thank you in advance. liu
in comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write: >while reading through the dos 6.0 book, it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive. to make things compatable, >i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade. however, when all the dust settled, and i go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the windows directory. my question is: how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't? you might want to look in windows faq for this one, but here is my best explanation. but i can't guarantee that i'm not way off base... the permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card. the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file. it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file. compressed disks are actually "logical" disks. these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk. furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used. (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level). because of this "inbetween" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the "logical" disk. a permenant swap file is only there to "reserve" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos. windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space. (i don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.) a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios. if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dos...tsr's (disk compression)...and bios in order to be access. (i.e. never use a temporary swap file...never) more on permenent swap files... i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message "you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway" or something like that. well, a friend of mine (robert) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2. then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space. windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers. they also said that under absolutely no circumstances...none!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size. well...that's what he said! i call bull@#$#. if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it? any takers? james (if this doesn't get to the net, will someone post it for me? thanks)

	i'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a dos app. 	basically, i have several dos apps that i use now and then with different files. they all accept a file as a command line parameter, but the only way (at least that i know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the pif file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point i type in the file name). problems are: 	1) sometimes i can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager. 	 and 2) i'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried several directory levels deep. 	if anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, i'd appreciate it. thanks, tim -- 	the net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy reczek@autarch.acsu.buffalo.edu

hello, i'm investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework. i have come across a few that look good: zapp 1.1 from inmark zinc 3.5 from zinc software c++/views from liant win++ from blaise some considerations i'm using: being new to windows programming (i'm from the unix/x world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important. however, since i'm not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one. i don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the api, are valuable. since we will be developing for the 32bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows 3.1 api are less important. we will probably buy another c++ class library (something like tools.h++ or booch components from rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff (allocators etc...). so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have. the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media. i was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially zapp and zinc). a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are: zapp ---- seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes. has new fancy 3d-style controls available, and support for custom controls. has a windows nt version (essential) redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing) sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize. seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system. zinc ---- has a platform independent resource strategy. (not too important for me right now) comes with a interface builder tool has a windows nt version (essential) seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a dos version. had a better demo :-) both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated, thanks, brett harper brett.harper@cimlinc.com

(novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos, so don't scorn the concept.) 	anyway, don't expect it soon. windows 4 and dos 7 are supposed to be released next year (read: see it in 95), so i expect that chicogo won't be out til '96. 	with luck, i'll be proven wrong! =) rob |------------------------------------------------------------| \ rmohns@vax.clarku.edu / _________\ /________ \ rob mohns / ================================================== annoy rush limbaugh. think for yourself. ==================================================

you have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in windows than in dos - regardless of what communication software you are using. try the following: 1) turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to. the cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters. 2) use a different uart for your serial line. the old uart's (8250 or 16450) can only buffer one character internally. the new uart's (16550) can buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations. you can run \windows\msd.exe to find out what uart is on the machine. ron

as the subjects says, windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me gpf) on me of late. it was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every day. the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie i can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always gpf's in the same application. sometimes i can recover by simply closing the application that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and i need to re-boot. some background: i have a leading edge 486sx25 with phoenix bios. when i first got it it had 4mg of memory. it ran windows fine (not too many gpf's). then, a couple of weekends ago, i installed lotus 123 for windows (with atm), a game card and an additional 4 1mg simms. the leading edge machine is kind of strange, in that it has the ide controler built into the motherboard, the cpu is actually on a sparate board that plugs into the motherboard and the simms it uses are macintosh simms! apparently i was told that the leading edge had the parity bit built into the mother board. the original 4mg 80ns simms where of the 2 chip variety from samsung, and the ones i installed are 8 chip simms. they are recognized fine by the bios ram check. the game card is a generic $20 gamecard. the reason why i mention the hardware like this is that sometimes rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. i haven't tried taking out the ram or the game card, because as i said these gpf are not reproducible at will. i have gone through and entire day using the computer with no problems and then i might get 5 or so gpf's in the sppace of 20 minutes? what can i do. this situation is most annoying... are there any good diagnostic tools for hardware? do you think that this might be a software problem (ie emm386 etc.)? if it helps, i have manage to get gpf's on after dark, quicken, paint shop pro. a lot of them have been in user.exe or gdi.exe. any help is truly appreciated..... -eric ebosco@us.oracle.com

can't : see it having trouble keeping up. his pcplus for dos works great, re: what to do after the high speed modem arrives. edition 01 apr 93 this article applies only to windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to nt, os/2 or dos apps not running under windows. one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs-232c (serial, com) performance is seriously deficient. almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (v.32bis, v.32, pep or hst) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem. overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program. if the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem. there are three reasons for the problem: 1. the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitters (uarts) used in most pcs are primitive ns8250 devices with single-byte fifo buffers. if the operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost. dos, being a fairly single-minded environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. windows can't. 2. windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos, and interrupts often take longer to service. overruns are much more likely than under dos. as soon as you report to your pc/modem vendor that you are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a 16550". more likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue, you'll get no useful advice at all. most of the store-front and mail-order sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even know what a uart was. 3. even your pc has ns16550a uarts (and ps/2's do), or if you can upgrade your mother/com board or add a new com board, you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. windows 3.1 is improved in this regard over 3.0, but i still recommend a driver upgrade. applications like procomm+/win (which is what i use) cannot get around this problem by themselves. if you have a modem card, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart, and avoid overrunning it; however, i wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 uart if i ever buy a modem card. some modem cards don't even have conventional uarts, but if they are to work with standard windows drivers, they need to simulate one. use msd.exe (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be. the hardware situation. the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns8250 or ns16450 chips (or megacells inside vlsi chips where you can't replace them). you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program \windows\msd.exe. be sure to run it in dos *before* bringing up windows. the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a windows dos prompt. the ns16550 uart has separate 16-byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. the 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250. the 16550 also has dma capability, but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this. for more technical info, see national semiconductor application note an-491. so, what uart component do you have? try to locate the uart on your mother board, multi-function i/o card, com board or isa/mca modem card. if you can't find a socketed component with the numbers "8250" or "16450", your com ports are probably buried in vlsi, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement. if you can disable your vlsi com ports (as i chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket com board. if you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in ns16550afn or pc16c550cn (low power cmos version) ics from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each. the "n" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package. other styles are available, but avoid any ns16550 chips without the "a" (the 16c550c are presumably all ok). early ns chips have bugs, although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free. clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national. the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: national semiconductor: 16550a, 16551, 16552 chips&technology: 82c607 texas instruments: t16c550a silicon systems: 73m550 vlsi 16c550 turbocom warns about the pre-"a" ns16550 and western digital 16c550, says that problems have been reported with early ibm ps/2 55sx and 70 systems (ibm reportedly will upgrade them). if you don't have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market com or multi-function board. if this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. to add a new com or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the com1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to com3/4 (although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom). although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly i elected

jdr... i only needed two serial ports, and am running out of irqs on my pc, so i disabled my built-in vlsi-based 8250 ports. however, with the turbocom driver (below), i could have set the internals as com3 and 4, using irq sharing. the software situation simply upgrading to 16550 uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems. the standard ms serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. the windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations: - they enable only the receive fifo, and only at rates above 2400 bps. - they never enable the transmit fifo, which results in an interrupt rate of 10x during uploads. - they set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2 more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo). - the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to 19200. with a v.32bis modem, sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1 or more, suggesting that a host dte connect rate of 57,600 bps would be effective. - the api won't accept rates above "cbr_128000". - the api won't let dos programs know there is a 16550 there, and even if it did, dos programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit from a 16550 port with the standard drivers. - they don't allow irq sharing for com3,4. - the bios doesn't initialize com3,4 properly in many systems. - windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port speed options above 19200 bps. these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). rumors suggest they "may" be solved in windows "4.0". you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of "turbocom", current version 1.2,

price was around $50 as i recall. bio-eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so i had to send a check. egghead and 1-800-software list turbocom but as far as i know, they don't stock it. bio is not a software company per se. they apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite. they recently upgraded it for windows 3.1. it is run-time licensed. i now have my host (dte) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of my datacomm apps, and i am having zero problems with downloads. i routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. i am also using 115,200 bps when linking an hp95lx to my pc, with lossless bi-directional i/o. uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers. note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the windows 3.1 port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port. turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes. i also have cts/rts hardware flow control enabled, and i suggest that you do the same. even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ascii data, xon/xoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control. the informal (dec) standard for xon/xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device. the 16 byte fifo in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xon/xoff. a well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do cts/rts all by itself in the dos/windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky. even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. if this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed com board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/turbocom upgrade. a review of two such boards, and a review of turbocom, can be found in the feb'93 issue of "windows sources" magazine. i suggest trying a 16550/turbocom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems. closing soapbox comments the state of rs-232c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry. because it is the oldest standard i/o interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies. the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. in my last job, with a major workstation vendor, i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system. that family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports. however, this is the exception. few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent i/o. you may as well learn what you can about serial i/o, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon. when v.fast arrives, i expect cries of outrage from windows users world-wide whose 8250 pcs "sort of" work today with v.32, but will fail miserably with v.fast. without a hardware-buffered uart (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage, a v.fast modem will be a waste of money. regards, 1001-a east harmony road bob niland suite 503 internet: rjn@csn.org fort collins co 80525 compuserve: 71044,2124 (303) 223-5209 copyright 1993 robert

hi ... can anyone tell me where i can get a copy of updated canon bj-200 printer driver for windows 3.1, if any ? i have ver 1.0 which comes with my bj-200 printer, i just wonder if there is any newer version. thanks very much, please email.
this may be a simple question but: we have a number of pc's which we use to link to a mainframe using novell lan workplace for dos (via windows 3.1). now, to make life easier for us we are thinking of using windows for workgroups to allow file sharing across our pc network. now does anyone know if it is possible to use w4wg and lan workplace for dos at the same time. ie can i access a file on another pc while being logged on to the mainframe at the same time, simultaneously. any help well appreciated. gary hunt. centre for advanced studies in architecture university of bath absgh@gdr.bath.ac.uk

our student association runs a small novell network which has a subnetwork of windows for workgroups and microsoft mail. the director of finance, en electrical engineering student, would like to gateway this system, either via slip or not, into the university's network and thus the internet, at the very least to exchange e-mail, but possibly also to do ftp's etc. for now, this would be done via a 9600 bps modem. he would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check mail, but would otherwise connect whenever needed. what is the best way to do this? gatewaying software is available, but what works best? please reply to me: dkmiller@unixg.ubc.ca or the d of f : dleung@ee.ubc.ca with a cc: to the other. i don't read all of these groups regularly, so mail is best. if this is a common question, please pot me to a faq or ftp site. :=:=> derek k. miller dkmiller@unixg.ubc.ca researcher, alma mater society thegrodd@tz.ucs.sfu.ca university of british columbia, canada room 230b - 6138 sub blvd., vancouver, b.c. v6t 1z1 campus mail zone 1 phone (604) 822-6868 fax (604) 822-9019
somewhere in this thread, it has been said that windows nt (tm) is a multi-user os, as well as multi-threading, etc. i certainly haven't seen this to be the case. there are seperate accounts for each person, and even seperate directories if that is desired. i don't see an implentation of simultaneuos use though. 		scott -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- scott reimert \ reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com /standard disclaimer: redondo beach, ca \______________________________________/"blah blah blah ...

while there are too many ps clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. three questions come to mid real quick for something like this. q:	which version of adobe ps will we clone? 	aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, adobe has in the past released 	new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other 	software vendors do. the level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but i assure 	you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to 	dwindle in the face of competition. this allows them to shift people to 	maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3. q:	do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly? 	from the laserwriter to the laserjet 4 there have been bugs. (if i had 	a number to call at hp or adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) deciding 	which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate. q:	do we follow the red book, or do we follow someone's implementation? 	without a doubt, there are differences between the red book and adobe's 	ps. with level 2 many issues have been refined but the red book does 	leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. it would be 	nice it the red bood at least pined things down enough so that two 	different implementations of adobe's ps don't do the exact opposite given 	an identical set of conditions. q:	pscript.drv? 	having done a lot of ps clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of 	testing is the limited number of sources for test files. the primary 	source we use is genoa. and having characterizes their 1992 ps ats files, 	(1300+ of them) over half are taken from pscript.drv. it may not ideal, 	but the ats files are what the printer vendors use. i'm sure that adobe 	uses them too, but adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its 	wrong. yes, there are some very poor clones. we've seen them here at rastek (a sub of genicom which has its own clone called geniscript). some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the red book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what ps is. don newbold									don@rastek.com

hi, everybody: i guess my subject has said it all. it is getting boring looking at those same old bmp files that came with windows. so, i am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file i can share. or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files, etc.... i used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all. anyway could me give me some help, please??? thanks a lot! john

i just installed a new truetype font under ms-windows 3.1 but though all the applications display the font correctly on the screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly (on a laserjet 4 - non-postscript printer). when i use the font in coreldraw, the document prints correctly, so i assume coreldraw knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer. but when i use the windows accessory write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font. yet, write does display the font correctly on the screen. i looked through all the windows and laserjet manuals, but got nowhere. all of them just make the statement that truetype fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen---so i assume windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that???? appreciate any help....

i've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550c from word for windows. history: when i had a deskjet 500, i had to modify the macro so that it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that interferred with printing envelops. that bug is still present, however... now: the problem i have is that my deskjet 550 print driver (came with the printer i bought in december) still wants to print the envelops in portrait mode. however, the deskjet 550 feeds envelops the from the narrow end (i.e. landscape mode). how do i get the printer to print the envelops in the correct orientation? please please please do not post this to the net since: (a) due to end of the semester cruch, i can't keep up on these groups, and (b) i will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow! thanks in advance, craig stevenson

hello fellow 'netters. i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase, the canon bj200 (bubblejet) vs. the hp deskjet 500. i thought, rather than trust the salesperson, i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential. and, i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson. now, i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett-packard deskjet 500 (300 dpi). which is faster? is there a noticeable print quality difference, particularly in graphics? which will handle large documents better (75 pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated here? which works better under windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)? cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc? basically, your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable, both good and bad. advance kudos and thanks for all your input. e-mail or news posting is readily acceptable, but e-mail is encouraged (limits bandwidth). -- sincerely, robert kayman	----	kayman@cs.stanford.edu -or- cpa@cs.stanford.edu "in theory, theory and practice are the same. in practice, they are not."

to all hardware and firmware gurus: my current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a physically handicapped relative of mine. my goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an at sytle keyboard to its host system. this will be a highly endowed keyboard with a little pcl from z world at its heart. the only thing i lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with windows 3.1 and dos 5.0) will be expecting. my project is independant of windows, my hope is that some of you fellow window's users/programmers will recognize what i need and be willing to point me in the right direction. i have the winn l. rosch hardware bible (2nd edition). the hb gives most (if not all) of the information i will need concerning scan codes and even a wire diagram for the ps/2 style connector i will need, but it leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1. is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication? i'm guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock. in either event, how is the data framed? 2. is it half-duplex or truly one way? i'm guessing half-duplex since the host can turn leds on and off. 3. are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "at keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)? if anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. whatever i do it must be safe for i cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo. thank you for your time. danke fuer ihre zeit. thomas gamet (gamet@erg.sri.com) software engineer sri international

hi, have you used mac system 6.x or 7.x? if the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a "mature" os. days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real os. i can see why they have such question. ms-windows confuses many people. microsoft simulated mac, but it did a lousy job. for example: (1) you can not create hierarchy groups. there is no way to create a group in a group. (if you know how, please tell me.) (2) too many system parameters to take care of. (3) uncomplete documentation. it's not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error. (4) group deleting/file deleting after deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files. but if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full of nonsense files. (5) share problem once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. you just can not open or save the program if it is loaded. it makes sense to prevent from saving, but not opening. microsoft try to compromise between dos and windows, but they just make ms-windows a graphical dos with capacity doing mutiple dos jobs; the worst thing is they complicate the environment. the orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make pc easier to use. it's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute. no flame, please. jesse e-mail:cyen@cs.unt.edu/ic43@sol.acs.unt.edu
you need gs252ini.zip and 24*.zip, and 25*.zip font files. you can get these from wuarchive.wustl.edu /mirrors/msdos/postscript. i also advice you to get gs252gui.zip from cica. it is a nice interface for ghostscript. ghostscript is very user unfriendly. this interface makes it user friendly. for using this interface you have to get vbrun100.dll (from risc.ua.edu /pub/network/misc) copy this to your windows directory. copy gui executables and other files to your ghostscript directory. and anter the line below to your autoexec.bat. set gs_lib=c:\<your ghostscript and gui directory> now you are ready to use it. enjoy it. in article <1993apr16.114432.1@ulkyvx.louisville.edu>, cl238405@ulkyvx.louisvill e.edu (steve w brewer) writes: >what files do i need to download for ghostscript 2.5.2? i have never used >ghostscript before, so i don't have any files for it. what i *do* have is >gs252win.zip, which i downloaded from cica. unfortunately, it doesn't seem to >work on it's own, but needs some more files that i don't have. i want to run >ghostscript both in windows 3.1 and in ms-dos on a 386 pc (i understand there's >versions for both environments). what are all the files i need to download and >where can i get them? any info would be appeciated. > >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - > steve w brewer rewerb w evets > cl238405@ulkyvx.louisville.edu ude.ellivsiuol.xvyklu@504832lc >------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - > -- ____________________________________________________________________________ **************************************************************************** _m_ _ 0___ \ _/\__ |/ \ /|

to get hierarchical icon groups in ms-windows use norton desktop for windows. ms windows in not mature. it's lousy. but its supposed to be lousy. it's goal is to be ubiquitous not good. ms-windows is the course for the masses in it infrastructure 102. (dos = 102, cp/m = 101.) unix was the course for the cogniscenti in it infrastructure 101. together they prove that there is good effect of good it, and there is good effect of ubiquitous it. what we need, now is both at a significiantly higher level of function. posix + dce + corba + ????? ? see the problem? nt may be it infrastructure 103, but it will also be it monopoly 102.

dear friend, the risc means "reduced instruction set computer". the risc usually has small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase the clock rate to have a high performance. you can read some books about computer architecture for more information about risc. ghhwang@csie.nctu.edu.tw form r.o.c taiwan
hello. i purchased a video card called et-4000 true color card which can provide about 1700k colors. but the question is i can't find the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , i am now using 65k colors driver for win31. it works fine , but i think it will be better if i use 1700k driver. so, please tell me whether such a driver is available ! thanks in advance. -- ===================== ( forever 23, michael jordan.) ===================== tony g. wu gtonwu@uz.nthu.edu.tw cae/rheology lab. nthu. tony@che.nthu.edu.tw

hi there, i'm having a bizarre video problem within windows 3.1. i have a 286 with a gvga-16 video board. i've been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers. i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it's screen. the problem is that once windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves. at first i thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to windows - however, when you initially return to windows, the original colors get refreshed properly. also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc. the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black. if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows - the screen gets refreshed again. if i don't log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network, everything is fine. i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine. when i ran into problems, i deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again. when that didn't work, i tried reloading windows to no avail. any thoughts on things to check out? i am totally baffled! thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction! linda cornell lcornell@u.washington.edu uw office of research

hi, i recently bought an orchid fahrenheit 1280+. it's a real nice card, but i'm having very big problems with it. the basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows. something like every other line or so. also, when i use a dos gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in fahrenheit 1280 mode, vertical lines are swapped. it's very strange looking. if it uses vesa standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's only 512k on the card. (there's 1mb on there). i have contacted orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't have the answer. i don't think the card is the problem, since it works great on my friend's computer. here is my setup: fahrenheit 1280+, 1mb, bios 1.1 386-25, opti-chipset2, ami bios 1990, 5mb ram. maxtor 120mb harddrive, (slave) maxtor 40mb harddrive (master) panasonic c1381 monitor, version 4.6 windows drivers. windows 3.1 i tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards (besides disk controller) off. my friend's setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor. if anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, i will be very greatful. please send e-mail to tdarugar@tartarus.ucsd.edu or 			tdarugar@ebon.ucsd.edu tony.

i have an okidata 2410 printer for which i would like to have a printer driver. has anyone seen such a thing? there is not one on the microsoft bbs. i can print to it from windows but i have no fonts available and with paradox for windows i can't print labels on it unless there is a proper printer defined. thanks, bryan k. ward survey research center university of utah i-mail: bryan@src.sbs.utah.edu
i am looking for a win31 driver (or set) for my diamond speedstar 1mb video card. does anybody know of an archive site that has these? i looked at cica and it had drivers for the stealth card and for generic et4000 cards but not one specifically for the speedstar. is there one? or has diamond dropped the speedstar out of the driver development loop. thanks for any info, rob -- robert mee boston university information technology (rem@bu-it.bu.edu)

hi all, has anybody tried to compile ctrltest from the mfc/samples directory, after compiling the mfc-libs with bwc ? seems to me, that bwc isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded functions. for example, imagine the following 2 (overloaded) functions: void same_name ( void ) void same_name ( int ) after trying the whole day, i think, with bwc its impossible to take the adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined function pointer. am i right ? has anybody else had this problem ? 	thanx

hi. while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows 3.1 this evening, i got a "program has violated system integrity... close all applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error. i started to do this when i immediately got a "serious disk error" message from windows. "hit return to retry". i did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow. (i am including the chkdsk output below.) questions: 1) is there an easy way to restore everything to working order? what might be some better approaches? 2) what might have caused this? does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable? (i'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.) the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things. thanks for your comments and suggestions. brad banko ps: this is a 386sx machine with a 40mb hard drive and 2 mb of ram. chkdsk output: ====================================================================== volume serial number is 1159-09d3 errors found, f parameter not specified corrections will not be written to disk c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.exe allocation error, size adjusted c:\gfx\vpic46\vpic.txt allocation error, size adjusted c:\gfx\vpic46\video7.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\gfx\vpic46\orcpro2.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\gfx\vpic46\vga.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\game\goose\bird2.x allocation error, size adjusted c:\winmisc\adv21\winadv.exe allocation error, size adjusted 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains. 647168 bytes disk space would be freed c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 c:\gfx\vpic46\geno5400.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16138 c:\gfx\vpic46\tri8800b.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16139 c:\gfx\vpic46\ts4000hi.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16140 c:\gfx\vpic46\config.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16141 c:\gfx\vpic46\vpic.txt is cross linked on allocation unit 16146 c:\gfx\vpic46\video7.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16151 c:\gfx\vpic46\defincon.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16152 c:\gfx\vpic46\atiwondr.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16153 c:\gfx\vpic46\geno6400.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16154 c:\gfx\vpic46\oak.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16155 c:\gfx\vpic46\hires.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16156 c:\gfx\vpic46\aheada.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16157 c:\gfx\vpic46\vpic.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16208 c:\gfx\vpic46\orcpro2.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16184 c:\gfx\vpic46\everx673.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16185 c:\gfx\vpic46\wait.com is cross linked on allocation unit 16186 c:\gfx\vpic46\maxxon.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16187 c:\gfx\vpic46\wait.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16188 c:\gfx\vpic46\everx678.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16189 c:\gfx\vpic46\ega.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16190 c:\gfx\vpic46\config.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16191 c:\gfx\vpic46\readme.1st is cross linked on allocation unit 16199 c:\gfx\vpic46\vga.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16201 c:\game\goose\bird2.x is cross linked on allocation unit 16382 c:\windows\system\sound.drv is cross linked on allocation unit 16380 c:\windows\games0.grp is cross linked on allocation unit 16367 c:\windows\mad79-11.bmp is cross linked on allocation unit 16341 c:\mage\demo2_2a.kin is cross linked on allocation unit 16151 c:\mage\demo2_2b.kin is cross linked on allocation unit 16257 c:\mage\pkin_2_2.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16339 c:\winmisc\games\dialword.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16184 c:\winmisc\games\dialword.txt is cross linked on allocation unit 16201 c:\winmisc\adv21\winadv.wri is cross linked on allocation unit 16257 c:\winmisc\adv21\adv.key is cross linked on allocation unit 16265 c:\winmisc\adv21\adv.rec is cross linked on allocation unit 16275 c:\winmisc\adv21\freezer is cross linked on allocation unit 16339 c:\386spart.par is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 c:\bng2.mbx is cross linked on allocation unit 16146 42366976 bytes total disk space 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files 153600 bytes in 67 directories 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files 1564672 bytes available on disk 2048 bytes in each allocation unit 20687 total allocation units on disk 764 available allocation units on disk 655360 total bytes memory 579712 bytes free -- brad banko; dept of physics; u of illinois; b-banko@uiuc.edu ========================================================================= see one. do one. teach one.			73 de kb8cne @ n9lnq.il

i just got a copy of tobias' managing your money v9.0. i have quicken 6, and it's wonderful for some things, but mym seems to have some features that q6 doesn't. for example, q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account). or is there something that i'm not doing right, and q6 can actually do that? anyway, mym seems to be able to handle monthly deductions. in fact, it can apparently do better than that. that is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly. anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs? or can someone just give me their own personal impressions? maybe someone who has used both. or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review? anything would be greatly appreciated. if i keep mym, i have to pay for it, and i don't know whether it's worth doing. if mym is better than q6, of course i will keep it. but if q6 can do everything mym can do (maybe even better), i won't. thanks all! if you post a reply, please also cc me. thanks.

i am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business. the particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a windows-based accounting system. my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary). it then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of daceasy or m.y.o.b., and fire it all up! the 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup. well, this all seems too easy to me. would any of you network gurus out there tell me if i am out of my mind here? any and all suggestions, however trivial, will be immensely appreciated. my apologies if this has been brought up before. thanks! john -- john e. martin jemartin@nyx.cs.du.edu university of puget sound '92 kent, wa (formerly martin@ups.edu) seinfeldsupersonicsrushbelafleck -- john e. martin jemartin@nyx.cs.du.edu university of puget sound '92 kent, wa (formerly martin@ups.edu) seinfeldsupersonicsbc++rushdweckl

i just got off the phone with mathsoft technical service. they are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with maple and norton desktop for windows. they have no clue at this time and are collecting configuration information on the systems which exhibit the problem. anyone having problems loading the maple solver in mathcad 4.0 under ndw shoud call technical support at 617-577-1017. they made no schedule promices, but are actively working on the problem. in the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configuration selection in autoexec.bat to use progman (yuk, pew) whenever you plan to use the maple solver and ndw otherwise. i am using norton be to place a little menu on the screen with a 5 second timeout to auto boot ndw. +---------------------------------+----------------------+ | _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ | david a. fuess | | _/ _/ _/_/ _/ _/ | dir, center for eecs | | _/ _/ _/ _/_/ _/ | phone: (510)423-2436 | | _/_/_/ _/_/_/ _/ _/ _/_/_/ | fax: (510)422-9343 | +-------- lawrence livermore national laboratory --------+
since swapping out my generic vga card for a diamod speedstar 24x, i have noticed two new problems: * if i create a windowed ms-dos session (386 mode), when the text starts to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire display. ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the desktop * after a short time in ncd's pc x-remote for windows, all characters displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; i am unable to restore without rebooting. these are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts. dos 5, win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed. i like the speed of the card and have had no other problems. any ideas? thanks! -- steve chesney slc@catherine.cim.cdc.com metaphase technology inc. 612-482-4662 (voice) 4233 north lexington avenue 612-482-4001 (fax) arden hills, mn 55126

walther, i'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering. i'd only suggest using the color screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. if this is not too small for your tastes at a 14".... personally i'd prefer the mono-screen as i always have quite a few windows open. if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color 'surplus' is worth trading in the smaller size. if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors. i used a 14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen. regards, olaf winkelhake
i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card. some have been positive but most are negative. could people please confirm these? (i am interested in the eisa version in particular). 1) the card does not work in a system with 32m ram. 2) the card works in a 32m system with some switches set but it is much slower. 3) the card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes. 4) the latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many cases. 5) this card is the fastest full colour card for the money. 6) this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-) thanks for your feedback. i will summarize. al -- alan walford eos systems inc., vancouver,b.c., canada tel: 604-734-8655 aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca or ...uunet!wimsey.bc.ca!eosvcr!aew
i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few questions about windows for workgroups. i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1). i am considering moving all our machines to w4wg. q1: how much conventional ram does w4wg use over and above the driver for the network card? q2: if i have a novell ne2000 card, are the lsl and ipx drivers still needed? q3: does w4wg do a license check over the network to ensure each machine is running its own licenced copy of w4wg? (note: i do not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy of w4wg for each of our machines, it is just that i would like to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. returning one opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies.) q4: if you buy the upgrade to windows 3.1 for w4wg does it replace all of win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current win 3.1 files? q5: if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out, will i have any troubles with the w4wg machines? when i started this message, i was going to ask only 2 questions but i got carried away. i'll stop now ;-). i look forward to your replies. al -- alan walford eos systems inc., vancouver,b.c., canada tel: 604-734-8655 aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca or ...uunet!wimsey.bc.ca!eosvcr!aew
hi, 	we've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a serial printer (dmp or laser). i have used works and windows write. the output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output, but anything fancy garbles or just doesn't output. the exception is outputting to a lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to bother about handshaking messages. i'm sure i'm not alone in this. i've tried most of the print/network manager options i can think of. anyone had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it?? thanks john atherton

we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w4wg for a while now. we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway. you also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work. you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff. we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do. there is a glitch somewhere in the system though. i don't know if it is ms mail, the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent. the scenario is this. the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go. if that mail is routed to the vax, the vax has problems some times receiving the mail. most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location. that is the main gotcha. where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying "boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)". if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok. the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem. if anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out) phooey to that i say. i am looking vigorously for a better idea. if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew, please drop me a note - anyone. the next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip built in they say........ the netxt itteration of w4wg good luck!!!!! ******************************************************************* wes james email: wesj@extsparc.agsci.usu.edu utah state university cooperative extension systems specialist umc 4900 voice: (801)750-2229 logan, ut 84322-4900 fax: (801)750-3268 *******************************************************************

i just purchased the norton desktop for windows, and i also have norton utilities. when i installed ndw, it wanted to rem out the line that installed ep (ep /on) and the command to invoke the image utility. it replaced the image command with a new image command that invokes the version of image that came with ndw. this makes sense, as presumably the image version with ndw is newer than the one with nu. it did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec. now two questions: 1: will nu use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked. i.e. are the two version of image compatable? 2: will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa? i use both dos and windows, and i want to make sure that when i erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected. from the experiments i have run, the two programs (erase protect and smart erase) don't use each others info. i currently have both ep and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and i don't see any conflicts; fyi : norton desktop for windows version 2.2 norton util's version 6 thanks for any help.
word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw. our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box. they overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless. i believe the character used by w4w is the period-centred (0183). this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this. i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w4w. altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!! is the w4w character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf? -- ____ russ sharp russ@deakin.edu.au ph (052)27 1141 fax (052)27 2015 \ / deakin university, school of engineering & technology, geelong, australia \/

here is an annoying problem. whenever i save an icon which contains dark colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the bright colors. this happens with every icon editor including the image editor that came with sdk. i don't have this problem with .bmp files either; only with .ico files or icon libraries. the problem is with the icon colormap field in the icon file header. checking the file with a binary editor, i can see that the masks are ok. by editing the colormap manually (copying from another icon that i didn't edit) i can fix the colors. does anybody know what may be causing this problem? thanks. -- sadun anik, u of illinois at urbana-champaign center for reliable and high-performance computing e-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu

hi there, we are running a 120 node token ring with windows 3.1 and novell 3.11. every once in a while, we run into "the black screen of death", a phrase coined by robert x. cringely in a recent infoworld column. basically, sometimes when you quit windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen. also, sometimes when you exit to dos, the same effect occurs. cringely hints that microsoft and/or novell has a patch for windows' virtual interrupt controller that may solve this. neither company seems to know what i am talking about when i call them. has anyone else noticed this phenomenon? is there a fix for it? any response is welcome. peter sweeney psweeney@miavx1.acs.muohio.edu

i have just noticed my filemanager doing something strange recently. usually, the line at the bottom of the filemanager (the status bar, i guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection. if i select a whole bunch of files, i will get an exact byte count. recently, i notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating! if i select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'. if i select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', not 23 kbytes, just 23 bytes! if i select 893,352 it will report only 893 bytes in the selection. if i select over a meg worth of files, say 3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes! it's as if it's got a problem with displaying more than 3 characters! my system: 486dx/33, 8m memory, stacker 3.0, dos 5, win 3.1. i've run the latest virus scanners (scan102, f-prot) and they didn't report anything. could i have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting of the status bar in the filemanger? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- _/ _/ _/ _/_/_/ _/ _/ nicholas masika, masika@bnr.ca _/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ bell-northern research, ottawa _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/_/ (613) 765-4893 / fax:765-4309 _/ _/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/_/_/ _/ _/ opc development operations -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they >cache data writing.) you're not stupid. smartdrive caches things, and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also. all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment. >the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to >fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows >and a few other things. a reasonably accurate prediction... here's a brief description of how dos stores files: there are three pieces to a file. the directory entry, the fat chain, and the data area. you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3x5 cards. the directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number. it also holds some other information that's not important right now. the file allocation table (fat) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data. each square of graph paper holds a number. if the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available. if it holds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk. any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file. the data area (3x5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each. (in your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.) as a cluster is filled, another is allocated. to read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number. now you read the data from that cluster. next, look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read. this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards. continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the fat, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file. chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission. it doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it "fixes". now let's do a bit of a post-mortem: >c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.exe >c:\gfx\vpic46\vpic.txt >c:\gfx\vpic46\video7.cfg >c:\gfx\vpic46\orcpro2.cfg >c:\gfx\vpic46\vga.cfg >c:\game\goose\bird2.x >c:\winmisc\adv21\winadv.exe > allocation error, size adjusted all of these files have sizes (according to the fat) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries. chkdsk /f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size. (in other words, the directory entry for cvpic.exe may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. but chkdsk found a fat chain of 43 clusters attached to it. (my numbers, obviously, are made up.)) > 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains. > 647168 bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat, but is not attached to any directory entry. chkdsk /f gives you the option of converting these "lost chains" to files. you can then examine the files (file0000.chk through file0223.chk) and rename or discard them. or, if you tell chkdsk _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked "available" in the fat. >c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.exe > is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 ... >c:\386spart.par > is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 these files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster. obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong. it's interesting to note that c:\386spart.par is your windows swap file... to fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. this will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. now delete the cross-linked files. examine the copies and try to assemble them properly. good luck. (hint: "missing pieces" are likely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...) > 42366976 bytes total disk space > 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files > 153600 bytes in 67 directories > 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files > 1564672 bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full. this may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space... in any case, the short summary is that something trashed your fat. there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs. sorry. -- ---------------------------------------------------- gordon s. hlavenka cgordon@vpnet.chi.il.us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec. 3rd! -- ---------------------------------------------------- gordon s. hlavenka cgordon@vpnet.chi.il.us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec. 3rd!

to those interested in the new ati ultra cards: i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions. this message is a summary of the responses. thanks to all of you that replied. > 1) the card does not work in a system with 32m ram. a) the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only, as far as i know. the vlb and eisa version should have no problems. b) i'm pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesn't work in systems with over 16m ram. there is supposed to be way of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this, but apparently it doesn't work. i posted some "help me" messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didn't have this problem. c) false d) the vlb card, which i have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32m by using their configuration software. no messing with jumpers necessary. the 32m problem is probably valid only for isa cards. > 2) the card works in a 32m system with some switches > set but it is much slower. a) again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124m ram (eisa and vlb) or 12 m (isa). 32m should not be a problem for you. b) dunno. c) depends on the bus. yes if isa, no if eisa or localbus > 3) the card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes. a) nope. i can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all non-interlaced. b) yes - according to pc magazine, they've tested a local bus version that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced. c) not for the pro. sometimes for the plus. some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. this has nothing to do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. note that for 24 bit color and windows you must have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding. > 4) the latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many > cases. a) they aren't perfect, but are much improved. i don't recall the last time which i had to leave mach 32 mode (ati gup mode) and switch to 8514 or vga mode due to software incompatibility. b) true. many people recommended going back to build 55 or 54. c) they appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. for example, certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they do display ok on the screen. they are about par for fancy cards .. other accelerated cards also have bugs. d) overall, i like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory. i am running the 1024*768 16 color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow. i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram, but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver. > 5) this card is the fastest full colour card for the money. a) it's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate. b) yes - i'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what i wanted to use it for. too bad it crashed (in many different ways) every 20 minutes or so... c) depends on many many things. > 6) this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-) a) i like it. b) well - pc magazine seems to think it is. c) yes, this appears to be true :-) d) as to greatest thing since sliced bread, i doubt it. better cards are coming out. who knows, maybe ati will come out with something faster yet. several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which pycon was developing at that time. (pc magazine, about two months or so back) overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- that is the end of the questions. these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation. for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here (from an ati ad since i don't have an graphics ultra yet.) ati graphics ultra plus: - accelerated 1024x768 at 65k colours - true colour(16.7m) at 800x600 - multimedia video acceleration (for indeo video,rle and video 1 compressed) stretch full motion video windows to full size - fast vga - includes 3 button mouse (isa versions only) - anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,i think) - real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop - around a 1/2 length card size - priced from $400 u.s. ati graphics ultra pro: - everything in graphics ultra plus - faster performance with vrams - accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74hz non-interlaced - available in isa, eisa and microchannel - priced from $600 u.s. ati technologies (416) 756-0718 i hope this summary can be of use to you. al p.s. i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few years (which i generally liked). -- alan walford eos systems inc., vancouver,b.c., canada tel: 604-734-8655 aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca or ...uunet!wimsey.bc.ca!eosvcr!aew

hi. my last question for the year. i have a mail-order no-name notebook with 4 meg ram. i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview, but win3.1 and w4w2.0 constantly crash on me, most commonly citing a "memory parity error." the only thing i can do is turn off and re-boot. my cmos ticks off & counts all the memory every startup, and there is never a problem with this either. could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware? i remember having some disk error problems when installing it. is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening (i think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both crash frequently nonetheless) i know this is a pain, but please answer by email because my home account doesn't have rn. and i will stop asking questions now. thank you. chet pager = chetter@ucthpx.uct.ac.za

i find that it's always (almost anyway) busy when i dial, but if i try repeatedly, usually only 5 to 15 tries, i always get connected.
i've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because i have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....i've talked to mouse systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will soon!??. the other alternative seems to be possible, but in one case prohibitively expensive, i.e. 4 port card for $600??????!!, and in the other, the author(s) of powerbbs for windows claim to have a 4 port serial card with buffered 16550 uarts and drivers for windows to match (i.e. com3 irq5) for $120...... the second paragraph is hearsay, because i haven't checked it out yet.....but intend to as soon as i can free up $120 <g> hope this will save you some steps.

i have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate environments under windows for each of them. is there some way of setting things up separate desktops/directories for each of them? ideally, i'd like totally separate virtual machines. i'd be willing to settle for less, and may end up having batch files that copy .ini files around depending on who wants to use the machine. mark alas, setup/n doesn't work if you don't have a network.

greetings! i've had a bunch of problems with the 24x. opening a dos window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop. nothing can recover this except to completely exit from windows. the other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling, as if a cr was printed without an lf. this seems only to happen to communications programs, but i can't nail it down any further than that. note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating. even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem. prior to the latest rev of word perfect for windows, wpwin would sometimes blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem. i've still seen this, but only once or twice with wpwin 5.2. dave zimmerman (my opinions are my own)

are there any workspace managers out there for windows 3.1 ? by a workspace manager, i mean something like the hp apollo workstations have - multiple workspaces under x. there is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces. it overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen. instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them. thanks in advance.

is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle a compressed ide drive without screwwing it up? need to document occasional failures in reading/writing, check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors. i believe that all of my problems with dos/windows can be isolated to my drive. getting occasional corrupted files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off. had these problems under dos 5. only with drive c. drive d may have had one failure, but that file was under the control of win/winword on drive c. all utilities available to me report no problems. dos, ndd (nu4.5). another symptom, sd took forever on c, and kicked me out with a suspension till ndd run 6 to 8 times. thanks. -- mike hayes |"knowledge is good." - faber college motto www |"knowledge and thoroughness" -rensselear poly motto unemployed tech, |"no, thank you!" -groucho marx, 'a day at the races' driven to banging my head against engineering physics for 4 years.

i have a .bat file that i run under a windows icon. i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen. the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable. my problem is that on some of our machines (running ms-dos 5.0 and windows 3.1 in enhanced mode), the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error. i have raised the amount of environment space to 2048 bytes using the shell command in config.sys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out. if i just click on the ms-dos icon, i can create a bunch of environment varibles from the dos shell. the problem is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in a bat file fails. has anyone seen such behavior before? i see no place in the pif fail to configure environment space. lance j. gay internet: gay@venice.sedd.trw.com trw systems engineering & development div. phone: 310-764-3988 carson, ca 90746

i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (file is 5426dr13.zip). they're very recent, i downloaded them from the cirrus bbs (570-226-2365) last night. if you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well. i have a local bus based card (vl24 bitblaster from micron) but i think the drivers work with isa cards (or at least includes drivers for them). i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on cirrus's part but i don't think so. from steve gibson's (columnist for info world) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) i extracted the following for the sake of comparison: 							wintach 		winbn3.11	word	sprsht	cad	paint	overall steve's system: 486/33 vlb: ati graphics ultra pro	 9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 vlb: vl24 bitblaster		 9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65 its no viper, but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson's review. micron system owner's, i would be interested to hear your opinions on the dtc 2270vl local bus disk controller. my system came with a maxtor 7120 drive (120 mb) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 kb/s, i am now at 22 kb/s. is this about as good as it gets? i can't get a norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said. oliver weatherbee oliver@earthview

i quit windows normally to run a special dos app, got done with it and tried to start windows. ok got the title screen, windows background, dos with an error about loading progman.exe. hum, yep progman.exe is still there. must be bad, ok pull off progman.exe from a backup tape, start windows, get the windows title screen, windows background, dos with the same error. hum! fire up the good ol' norton disk doctor, test, 500 lost clusters! ok, fix them, and look through them, doesn't look important. remove the windows directory, and reinstall from disks. fire up windows, title screen, background, program manager, success! i have a 486/50 (amy) with 4 meg of ram, 120 meg hd, svga, running under dos 5.0, no special memory managers or stuff, just the basic windows 3.1 a 12 meg permanent swap file using 32-bit access. i mainly use windows to run more that one dos app at a time. (ie downloading with qmodem with a dos window open, and possibly pov running in the background.) i've noticed that since i started using windows a few months ago, lost clusters have gotten more and more common. although i don't like having data just disappear, it really haven't been a problem except for today. has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while running windows? and what could i do to fix the problem, i'd sleep better knowing amy wasn't loosing her marbles. :) steven -- steven marcotte			sdoran@matt.ksu.ksu.edu

i am using dos quick c 2.5 in a dos window under windows 3.1, and the other day while i was running the compiler, i got a general protection fault immediately followed by a "serious disk error". when i rebooted, i found that about 15 files had gotten "cross-linked" which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system. i am concerned that quick c in a dos window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem. i thought that dos programs run in dos windows were pretty well-contained by windows. if that is true, then maybe the quick c compiler has nothing to do with it. has anybody else had this type of problem?

thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows 3.1. i found 3 shareware workspace managers, from australia's ms-windows archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the u.s. the three i found were: 1. workspaces 1.10 (wspace.zip) this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found. it is very easy to use. it displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra button for configuration purposes. one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away. also, it would have been nice if there was an "always on top" setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons. maybe some user-specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature. the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package. 2. workshift 1.6 (wrksft16.zip) while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming to set things up. with workspaces 1.10, all but the first workspace is initially empty. with workshift 1.6, you need to take "snapshots" of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what applications they contain. also, the main window is quite large, but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace. with workspaces 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it. workshift 1.6 provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful. 3. bigdesk 2.30 and backmenu (backdesk.zip) this is an interesting package, which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager. other goodies include "backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you press a certain mouse button - just like in x-windows. the menu is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus, which is provides quite handy access to applications. you could say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager. also bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "wrun", which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications. the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk 2.30. bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces. in fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount, and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on. this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one. the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop. basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up of a particular section. try each of them out for yourself. i was impressed with all of them, so find out which one suits your needs the best.

(note: the followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc. dmqs files describe monitors and valid modes to be used by the xga-2 under both windows and os/2.) these files are unsupported! ibm has nothing to do with these files or this post. it's personal this time (and every time i post -- see the signature). due to demand and requests, here are some additional dmqs files i've collected for the xga-2. these files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the xga-2. not all these files will work under windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time. all files will function under the most recent os/2 2.1 beta and those i've tried have worked under os/2 2.0+sp. not all files have been fully tested. these files are unsupported! they represent a personal collection, not anything resembling an officially supported set. as a standard disclaimer i would like to point out the following facts: 1) some of these files may run your adapter out of spec. doing so can stress the ics on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) you should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability to use the mode you select. using these files represents hacking in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable about what you're doing. 4) if you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the dmqs files you have or wait until ibm releases official, tested dmqs files. although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the ibm files. these files are unsupported! by using them you may invalidate your warrenty. not all have been fully tested -- i don't have that many monitors. installation: unpack in your dmqspath environment variable, usually c:\xga$dmqs. then use the methods described in your xga-2 installation diskette to change your adapter or settings. packing: these files have been packed with the latest infozip utility. you will need pkzip 2.x if you don't have the infozip utilities. submitting: feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite dmqs files for your favorite monitors. i'm always interested in collecting more. archive: these files have been uploaded to ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in pub/uploads/xga2dmqs.zip. begin 644 xga2dmqs.zip m4$l#!!0``@`(`)i%eqj!0#0bn`````4!```&````<f5a9&ue38[!:l-`#$3o

a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation. once the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc. unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of spss left: when i run something like "write" and go to embed an object then "spss chart" appears on the list of objects i'm offered. i looked around all the obvious "ini" files without success. the next thing i tried was looking for the string "spss chart" in every file in the windows directory. it turned up in a file called req.dat (or reg.dat). unfortunately the file was binary and so i didn't feel inclined to edit it. i'd welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers. chris wooff (c.wooff@liverpool.ac.uk)

(from the windows resource toolkit (for win4workgroups)), add an entry to your "system.ini" file under the [nonwindowsapp] section: commandenvsize=nnnn "this sets the command.com env size, where nnnn must either be 0 or between 160 and 32768. a value of 0 disables the setting. if this value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768. if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment, this setting is disabled, as if it were 0. if you specify the environment size in a pif file for command.com, the pif setting overrides this setting. the default is 0 with msdos versions earlier than 3.2. otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the shell= command in config.sys. to set this value, you must edit your system.ini [and reboot]." i have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from the config.sys shell= line, and both give larger environments. if you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment _variables_ present when windows was started. (no matter how big the dos env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes.) this should allow your batch file to run, but your mileage may vary. -- jerome (jerry) schneider domain: jls@atg.com aspen technology group uucp: {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls po box 673, ft. collins, co 80522 voice: (303) 484-1488

i am looking for the latest drivers for the actix graphics accelerator card. the driver i am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2mb memory. the bbs support for actix is unbelievable! they are still using 2400bps modem! it will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you are calling long distance. is there any ftp site that has a collection of video drivers for windows? btw, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far? thanks. -- daniel y.h. wong					uoft:(416)978-1659 wongda@picton.eecg.toronto.edu				electrical engineering --

[ article crossposted from comp.os.ms-windows.apps ] [ author was dr. richard timmer ] [ posted on 24 apr 93 23:11:16 gmt ] hello winnetters: i have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of ms access and borland paradox/win. however, are there any users out there with experience with the database package called "approach". it has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than paradox. i have ruled out access because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a field to always have a value. i like what i've seen of paradox, but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what i have (386/25 mhz, 6 mb ram). so, please provide me with your thoughts are "approach", good and bad. thanks. richard timmer

ok, i have a 486dx50(isa) w/ diamond stealth vram 1mb. i was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows. but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos' vga, especially this new strike commander. ;-) this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench). my winmark was 6.35 million, i think. so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully can perform approx same w/ my current vram in windows and also can perform dos' vga preferably >30fps. i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that speedstar 24x and orchid prodesigner 2d-s ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard. both can give >30fps in dos' vga w/ 486dx2/66. does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)? any other card recommendation is welcomed too. also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-) thanks in advance, folks! ===martin

is anyone out there running a ms-dos system with a localtalk board? i am on an appletalk network, hooked up with a daystar digital lt200 mc localtalk interface board, running on a ps/2 model 70. i'm using the appleshare pc software for file server and network access. it works fine under dos or the window or os/2 dos box. but when i try to load it *before* windows, so that every application i run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as soon as i start up an application. and of course, things look pretty hopeless for os/2 (but who knows). so, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup? - duncan - duncans@phoenix.princeton.edu
a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde. the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. however, during this process i have come up with new problems. 1) there seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a dde topic string. is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb? 2) it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database? a) a dde sql update command does not seem to work. b) initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur. (the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated, i guess.) c) access does not allow vb to dde poke the information. the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key- strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command. this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes vb sends. are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions? are there any better work arounds to the above? are there any signs of an odbc driver for access? bob ran@doc.ic.ac.uk

hey all...i got an equation editor, and since it didn't automagically appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), i decided to manually place it there. so i went into win.ini (is there another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture. didn't work. quit windows, go back. aha: mistake. correct it. it looks fine. start windows...doesn't work. play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally i get it to work. the only thing i can see that's different now is that it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last. but now i end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working. (and only one entry in win.ini). so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this? (i.e. make "equation"appear but once?). also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above. it's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and "picture" has something to do withthe way it appears (picture/description?) but what are the others? i.e., in soundrec=sound,sound, whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd? and what is "soundrec"??

mornin' all. i was wonderin'..... i got screenpeace (the screensaver, which i think is *very* good), and i got a problem with it... there is an option there, "realize colour table", and if it's switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with some screensavers (e.g. the "flashlight" one). if i turn it off, however, it works well, and it's faster, so i have it off. all's nice and well. however, if i turn it off, then it will be on again next time i start windows. all the setting are set in the win.ini file, and i *do* have "save settings on exit" selected. also, i tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file to "n" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows. it will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again* turn the option on. i tried adding a +r (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then. actually, it's the same application. anywya, it didn't work, since it must change the setting at the win.ini file. so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me? thanks, i.a. mickey aka mp -- pe-|| || michael panayiotakis: louray@seas.gwu.edu ace|| || ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray |||| \/| *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a hd directory??* \\\\ | "well i ain't always right, but i've never been wrong.."(gd)

word for windows lets me designate text as being in a language other than us english. (alt-f l, format | language, as i recall.) so i mark it for english (uk), but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at "rumour". as far as i can see, microsoft didn't include the english (uk) dictionary on my disks.

to clarify: vc++ *is* considered an upgrade for c7. there will be no product called c 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of vc++ lists its version as 8.00). c7 is not a "dos"-only product -- it is a c/c++ compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows, as is vc++ (pro. ed.). the (significant) difference is that vc++ comes with many windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code). initial impressions have been very favorable. everyone who is a registered user of c7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c7. if you haven't, call microsoft and i'm sure they'd be happy to send you some! -jefrem iwaniw pelican software corporation

recently the following problem has arrisen. the first time i turn on my computer when windows starts (from my autoexec) after the win31 title screen the computer reboots on its own. usually the second time (after reboot) or from the dos prompt everything works fine. s far as i remember i have not changed my config.sys or autoxec.bat or win.ini. i can't remember whether this problem occured before i optimized/defragmented my disk and created a larger swap file (thank you mathcad 4 :( ) system 386sx, 4mb, stacker 2.0, win31, dos 5 --- --------------------------------------------------------------------- | carlos g. niederstrasser | only two things are infinite, | | princeton planetary society | the universe and human | | | stupidity, and i'm not sure | | | about the former. - einstein | | carlosn@phoenix.princeton.edu |---------------------------------| | space@phoenix.princeton.edu | ad astra per ardua nostra | ---------------------------------------------------------------------
well, i'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. i received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary. thanks to everyone who made it possible. on my own i was able to find out about codebase, accsys, and q+e. codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql. q+e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls, where you send a sql string and receive the results. most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland. other products mentioned were: microsoft's odbc, accsys, quadbase, codebase, rbase, and q+e. only odbc, quadbase, rbase, and q+e have sql. for myself, i decided on codebase, mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos, unix, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. it works with dbase, foxpro, or clipper files. however, i feel that microsoft's odbc looks very promising. it's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries, and formatting query results. as the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the "odbc programmer's reference" and the "odbc sdk guide". moreover, odbc doesn't actually interpret sql and liase with databases, that's up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. also, it's windows only (it's actually an extension to the windows sdk). nevertheless, it's a start at a sql interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future. here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by a line of asterisks (*). > does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing > their respective databases (paradox, foxpro) from within c programs? > i'd really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it > to a function which returns the query results in some format. failing > that, any other access would still be better than nothing. > > i'd also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing. > > if other people are interested, i'll prepare a summary of what i'm > told and post it. > > thanks to all. **************************************************************************** borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want. the current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) paradox 4.0. (why the versions are different, i don't know. pd engine 2.0 was compatible with pdox 3.0 and 3.5...). it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal (i think turbo pascal 5.5 and up) and c (i think either microsoft or borland). now.. reading the box... it's "borland paradox engine & database frameworks". works with any borland c/c++, mocrosoft c 6.01 or later, turbo c++ for windows, turbo pascal 6.0 or later, tp for windows 1.0 or later. for framework applications, bc++ 3.0 or later or ms c/c++ 7.0. it does have support for object useage... i

can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but i finally fixed my mouse jumpiness problems: i installed a bus mouse. (sorry, i didn't say the solution was free.) in the past i'd tried everything with my microsoft serial mouse. (cleaning it, unloading all kinds of tsrs, turning off smartdrv write cacheing, changing com ports, ...) nothing worked. yesterday i finally broke down and bought a mouse systems bus mouse. the improvement is even better than i had imagined! so much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (i just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and i had gotten so used to it i didn't notice. my wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second! i can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the mouse systems one you'll have to give up either com2 or lpt2 to an irq. also, if you don't know, mouse systems mice have three buttons. the driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button. hope this helps someone else. if you're anywhere near as frustrated as i was, it's well worth the $80. --- stephen thomas at&t tridom (404-514-3522) email: sat@eng.tridom.com, attmail!tridom!sat

howdy we have been having a real problem with an ast 386sx/16 machine with 4mb of ram. we installed paradox for windows, (but i don't think paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok (windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), dos 5, win 3.1) but the program will not load in 386 enchanted mode. the thermometer bar goes to 60% and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram talking about an illegal instruction. i've checked out the command.com thing, but as a long-time c programmer, i've crashed my share of machines with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-) anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced. we also have quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior. spent about 2 hours with borland's tech people, with no avail. the guy i talked to a microsoft didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly. somewhat disappointing, really. i expected more from microsoft. you'd think with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all the possible problems, but i guess not... microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing uae and general protection faults (sorry, i can't fax anything out of here so please don't ask, try microsoft), which we tried. we did *everything* they said, and still no luck. so. if you can help, please mail me. this problem is driving us nuts. i will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on. thanks kelly -------------------------------------------------------------------------- this is the real signature...please ignore the following demon signature.. kelly j. grant grantk@nosc.mil 4045 hancock st (619) 225-2562 "the next time someone asks you if you san diego, ca 92110 are a god, you say yes!" :-) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- kelly grant grantk@manta.nosc.mil (619) 553-0850 computer sciences corp ^^^^^^^^ important: manta.uucp won't get to me 4045 hancock street "if you are given lemons.....see if you can trade for san diego, ca 92110 chocolate" - me

what exactly does the windows bitmap format look like? i mean, how is the data stored: width, height, no. of colours, bitmap data? i couldn't find anything in ths user manual, is there any other reference material which would give me this information? thanks, andrew
hi all, i have a dll in which i register a class and create a window of that class type. both calls require a module instance handle, hinstance. petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the dll (page 934). i have two questions: 1) is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module? 2) what are the possible problems with using the instance handle of the dll? thanks in advance, mike -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- mike smith e-mail: m.smith@ma30.bull.com bull hn information systems inc. phone: (508) 294-2049 300 concord road ma30 - 815a fax: (508) 294-3807 billerica, ma 01821 usa -----------------------------------------------------------------------
due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts. this is a uuencoded bitmap. 960x600 256 colors. the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. reguarding image quality and resolution - i have not seen much better. for those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together. 	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files 	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer 	 in each file. 	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file 	4. uudecode the file there are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (unix) and uucoder (windows). if neccesary i could post these tools or where to get them by ftp -- let me know. ------------ part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 roman.bmp

i recently purchased a diamond stealth 24 video card and received the wrong drivers. does anyone know where i can ftp the windows video drivers for the stealth 24. i tried the drivers at cica and they don't work. the right drivers are on the diamond bbs but the file is almost 1 meg and it would take a while to download them at 2400 baud. any information would be appreciated. please contact me at doug@sun.sws.uiuc.edu thank you doug ward .

>i'd appreciate if you can email or post you positive >or negative experience with this monitor, especially >compared to to nanao 550i. >i'd summarize if i got multiple responses. i bought a viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week i took it back. i felt for the money my nec 5fg that i use at work was a much better monitor. the nec is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable. i have heard complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all. there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not match up. i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that the nec did not. i personally like the non-etched nec with the ocli filter and the tube on the 17 was not as nice. the 17 had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems. also, it would change brightness when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the controls. and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill. on the postive side, although not as handsome as the nec, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy. i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold through oem channels with a panasonic label on it. if it's available that way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it. for now the nec has my vote but i'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, nec 5fge's to see if it's just as good as its older brother the 5fg before i decide which one to buy. i have no experience with the nanao. i can never keep the nanao models straight and don't have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of all models. -- standard employer disclaimers apply -- keith w. johnson tektronix, gpi/nd info services, wilsonville, or, usa internet: keith.w.johnson@tek.com voice: 503-685-2953 fax: 503-682-3595
this is the official request for discussion (rfd) for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt. this is a second rfd, replacing the one originally posted in january '93 (and never taken to a vote). the proposed groups are described below: name: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup status: unmoderated. purpose: discussions about setting up and installing windows nt, and about 	 system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt. name:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc status:	 unmoderated. purpose: miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using windows nt, 	 including issues such as security, networking features, console 	 mode and windows 3.1 (win16) compatability. rationale: 	microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family 	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish 	to argue about the meaning of an "os"). the family ranges from 	modular windows through windows 3.1 and windows for workgroups to 	windows nt at the high end. to date, microsoft has shipped over 	50,000 beta copies and pre-release sdks of windows nt -- the 	actual release is slated for may/june '93. 	while windows nt has an entirely new design internally, it shares 	an application programming interface with the other members of the 	windows family; its win32 api includes the win16 api used in win- 	dows 3.1, and the win32s api subset (win32 less threads, networking 	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for 	windows 3.1. 	the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows 	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features. it uses 	program manager, file manager and other applets, and generally pre- 	sents an identical appearance to the user. many of the announced 	windows nt applications are ports of existing windows 3.1 apps, and 	nt also runs existing 3.1 applications. 	thus, it appears logical that windows nt should share the following 	groups with the other members of the windows family: 		comp.os.ms-windows.apps 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32 	 	the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as 	well as windows 3.1: 		comp.os.ms-windows.announce 		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy 	 	in conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the 	windows 3.1 and windows nt hierarchies is different internal 	structures of windows 3.1 and windows nt. and yet operating 	systems such as os/2, macintosh os, xenix and coherent all have 	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate 	newsgroup hierarchies. 	further, windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 -- 	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-dos-built-in next- 	generation windows, "chicago", debuts next year, surely it should 	remain in the same hierarchy. and what, then, would be the jus- 	tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions? discussion period: 	the discussion period will run from 27 april, 1992 to 18 may, 1993. voting: 	the cfv (call for votes) will be issued around 19 may, 1993, based on 	the feedback received during the discussion period. no votes will 	be accepted prior to the cfv. -- [ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ] [ "stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth. now pull ] [ up. that's how the corrado makes you feel." -- car, january '93 ]
i am starting to work on a project using dde to transfer data. the application came with an excel macro which can transfer the data. i need to 'port' it to 1-2-3w. 1-2-3w uses a very different setup for dde macros. does anyone have any suggestions as to good references? i have downloaded "ww01117: windows dynamic exchange (dde)" [the ms application note]. any books worth getting? the specifics are: server application: dionex ai-450 chromatography data system client application: 1-2-3 for windows v1.1 except for the macro, dionex did not provide any documentation for dde. also, i am having problems because i am trying to develop the application on my pc, but to actually get data, you need to be connect to the instrument. any help here would be appreciated, too. thanks, -- leon m. olszewski | nothing is worse than having an itch you can internet: leono@uiuc.edu | never scratch. leon - bladerunner
