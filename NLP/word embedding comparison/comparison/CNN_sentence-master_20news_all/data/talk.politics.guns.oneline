contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives. if this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate. but the nat'l commission on the causes and prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case. it appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks. in fact, the reverse was true. what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill. fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc. most gun homicides did not show this pattern. rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim. 	source: report on firearms and violence : then, since england != usa (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you

making any kind of social parallels between europeans and americans. there are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities. i just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks. i don't think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent crime here in the us, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi. on the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the canadians. in fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of vancouver, british columbia and seattle, washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control. in seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense. after a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon. the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted. in vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun. concealed weapons are not permitted. recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province. purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit. a permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs. handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. in short, gun control but not unreasonably so. both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws. convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties. the researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. in defining the cases, they used the same standard: the fbi's unified crime report. results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver (1.09 / 1.11). burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in seattle versus 12,034 in vancouver. the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12). however, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in seattle. in fact, 7.7 times as often. over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle, as compared to vancouver, was found to be 1.63. when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver. virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms. handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms. handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than in vancouver. the authors of the report also investigated "legally justifiable" homicides (self-defense). only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police. only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in seattle and 4 in vancouver. only 13 involved firearms. after excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings. ------- this is, i feel, a very fair report. one might even make the argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of ottawa, calgary and toronto while seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of nyc, chicago, los angeles and houston. critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means. this report shows differently. if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in vancouver than in seattle. however, during the study interval, vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods. as well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report. although seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period. and, as was reported, seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense. 	heavily quoted source: handgun regulation, crime, 	assaults, and homicide: a tale of two cities. 	john h. sloan, arthur l. kellerman, donald t. reay, 	james a. ferris,

---------------------------------------------------------------------- open letter by dr. paul h. blackman, research coordinator for nra-ila. nra official journal 1/89. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- dear sir: by now, we are used to the new england journal of medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of momentus "scientific" findings. these are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists. the latest effort -- "handgun regulations, crime, assaults, and homicide: a tale of two cities," by j.h. sloan, et al., with the accompanying editorial, "firearms injuries: a call for science," by two employees of the centers for disease control (november 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that i feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order. 	1. the authors misleadingly cite wright, et al. (ref. 1) to 	support the statement that "some have argued that restricting 	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate 	of homicide." wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that 	contention. 	 	2. the authors pretended that vancouver and seattle are very 	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories, 	demographic characteristics, and the like. in fact, the cities 	are very different with very different demographic characteristics 	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in 	seattle. both cities are over three-forths non-hispanic white 	and *the non-hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be 	the same in seattle and vancouver*. it is the different back- 	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various 	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide. 	 	3. the authors pretend they are evaluating canada's gun law, 	compared to washington state's. but they do not examine at all 	the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect 	in 1978. as it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975- 	1977), vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth 	involving handguns, (ref. 2) and in the seven years of the nejm 	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving 	handguns. surely even the medical profession recognizes that 	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding 	that a change made a difference? would a physician conclude that 	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day 	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without 	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen? 	 	4. the authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national 	gun law. nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily 	selected sample. seattle appears to have been selected because 	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific 	reason. would physicians call something a scientific study which 	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar "control"? 	had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite 	"scientific" conclusions would follow: vancouver's homicide 	rate *exceeds* that of such "wild west" cities in texas as 	el paso, corpus christi, austen, and, in colorado, colorado 	springs. (ref. 3) 	 	5. the authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or 	handguns "are far more commonly owned in seattle than in 	vancouver." they use two surrogate approaches in pretending 	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. the first is 	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry 	permits in seattle to the number of registered handguns in 	vancouver. but the number clearly understates the number of 	handguns in seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun 	owners. the second, however, tells nothing about the number 	of handguns in vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns 	for the most part. where is it difficult to obtain handguns 	legally for protection, registration figures are 	meaningless. there are 66,000 registered handguns in new york 	city (new york daily news, sept. 27, 1987). comparing the two, 	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population 	in new york city compared to 960 in vancouver, meaning vancouver 	has a greater "prevalence of weapons" than new york city. 	 	the second method of measuring gun density is "cook's gun 	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity 	differences." but the validation was by cook of his own 	theory. (ref. 4) normally, second opinions are sought from a 	different doctor. more significantly, the cook index is 	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement 	in suicide and homicide. so the authors are basically taking 	a measure of misuse. unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide 	(42% in seattle, 14% in vancouver) is related to gun misuse in 	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in seattle, 12% in 	vancouver). the authors are not measuring the relative avail- 	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in seattle and 	vancouver. 	 	6. the authors misstate the laws of both washington and 	canada. they neglect to mention the significant fact that 	washington has a waiting period and background check prior to 	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in canadian 	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal 	protection. the authors also make it appear that it is more 	difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than is actually 	the case. 	 	7. the authors ignore all other factors which might explain 	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the 	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a 	firearm. there is no measure of: the differences in the number 	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making 	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest 	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences 	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns, 	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. whereas social 	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences, 	the authors of the nejm "tale of two cities" fail even to mention 	most factors related to crime control. 	 	8. the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective 	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. such is not 	the case. criminologists (ref. 5-8) have found that almost 	650,000 americans annually use handguns for protection from 	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the 	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be 	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury 	to the victim. it is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors 	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides 	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle 	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides 	involving firearms. 	 	9. the centers for disease control, which funded the "study," 	editorially praised the paper, (ref. 9) saying it "applied 	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb 	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly 	handguns." there is nothing in the paper which could possibly 	be mistaken for "scientific methods" by a sociologists or 	criminologists. the vancouver-seattle "study" is the equivolent 	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding 	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25 	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs, 	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while 	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure 	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, 	announcing in a "special article" a new medical breakthrough. 	it would be nice to think that such a "study" would neither be 	funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm. 	 	since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the nejm and the cdc 	make them willing to present shoddy research as "scientific 	breakthroughs" in "special articles" and editorials relating 	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying 	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight 	over the activities of the centers for disease control about 	the distortions contained in "handgun regulations, crime, assaults, 	and homicides: a tale of two cities" and "firearm injuries: a call 	for science." clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside 	whenever the cdc and the new england journal of medicine seize 	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in america. 	 				references 1. wright jd, et al, *weapons, crime and violence in america*: a literature review and research agenda, washington, d.c.:

*firearm injuries: a call for science*. nejm: 319:1283-1285. ========================================================================== guns and sputter by james d. wright (from july 1989 issue of reason, free minds & free markets) someone once wrote: "statistics are like a bikini. what they real is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital." the problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide. funded by the federal government and published last year in the new england journal of medicine, the study compared homicide rates in seattle and vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban "may reduce the rate of homicide in a community." the nine medical doctors who published "handgun regulations, crime, assaults, and homicide" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) despite many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available. the second step in their reasoning seems indisputable. the overall homicide rate in seattle (for the period 1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in vancouver. homicide is definitely more common in seattle. the question then becomes, why? the authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning, that vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent. but their evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist. they offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in seattle; but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true. we are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established. indeed, the situation is even more troublesome. the first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed- weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted-weapons permits issued in vancouver. differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. * the second bit of evidence is "cook's gun prevalence index," which stands * at 41 percent for seattle but only 12 percent for vancouver. cook's index * however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in * various cities. it measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage * of homicides and suicides involving firearms. * in the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, * firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver. to take * cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be * assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides * is directly related to their relative availability in the general * population. but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. to * assume what one is seeking to prove, then to "prove" it on the basis of * that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything. even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that guns are less common in vancouver, we might still question what causes what. the authors attribute seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership. but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words, that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa. in fact, it was once commonly argued that great britain's low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership--until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted. to invoke an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause. nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership. the authors say seattle and vancouver are "similar in many ways," implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law stringency, and crime rates. this is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that "all else is equal" among things being compared. * clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look * reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime * or homicide rates. the cities are closely matched in what percentage * of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent). but seattle * is about 10 percent black, while vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. * vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly asian. so although the * authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- * dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown * that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. * in fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is * particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates * according to the race of the victim. for the white majority, the homicide * rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in seattle, 6.4 in vancouver. * the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due * entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities. for blacks, * the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for hispanics * 26.9 to 7.9. (methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison * problematic, but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver.) racial * minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle * than in vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain * in either city. since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in "gun availability" (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites. can differential gun availability explain why blacks and hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed in seattle than in vancouver? (studies in the united states, incidentally, do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.) or are other explanations more plausible? could the disparity between canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it? what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse? of homelessness among each cty's minority population? (the city of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi.) unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the united states usually exceeds 40 percent. what is the comparable canadian percentage? the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries. absent more detailed analysis, nearly any of these "many ways" might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates. in gross comparisons such as those between seattle and vancouver, all else is *not* equal. * the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide * result in a "complex picture." they do not acknowledge that the ensuing * complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument. they * also acknowledge that "socio-economic status is probably an important * confounding factor in our comparison," remarking further that "blacks * in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of * vancouver's population." given the evidence presented in the article, * it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle * and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle's racial * minorities. but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, * since "detailed information about household incomes according to race * is not available for vancouver." the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example. if one were to take all u.s. couties and compare them in terms of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one would find an astonishing pattern: counties with more guns have less crime. would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime? or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account? in this example, the "hidden variable" is city size: guns are more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city problem. if researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very seriously misled. in the study at hand, the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables, and their results are impossible to interpret. in the editorial "firearm injuries: a call for science" accompanying the study, two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the authors for applying "scientific methods" to a problem of grave public heath significance. but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out. absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research. that this study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals-- is cause for further concern.

the atf agent interviewed on "street stories" reported that the raid was ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the bd's) knew the atf was coming. why? i believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of president clinton. i would even suggest that the loss of 4 atf agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. it might even be beneficial to his agenda, as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. further proof might be that the atf denied their agents (street stories report) requests for sufficient fire power. important dates: feb 25th - nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. feb 28th - compound in waco attacked.	 on feb. 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. it looked like it might be a tight vote, but the senate in n.j. was going to vote to overturn the ban. it would not sit well to have an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given clintons stated agenda on gun control. i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in waco) to record the event for the tv audience. the agent on "street stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get ready fast", as "they know we are coming". i believe this attack continued, even tho the probablility of failure was high, because it came from the top down. after the n.j. assembly vote, the atf had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely. ...rich

(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the national crime survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.) so, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. this is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. if memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence. frank crary cu boulder

"face"? possibly. however, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. very few criminals shoot from cover: it attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. overall, i'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife. >...fortunately, the best defense against a knife isn't >another knife. anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have >much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife >assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants). actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem. you also ignore the criminal's reaction: the national crime survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. if faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. knives, however, are much less effective than guns: criminals don't consider knifes as a "serious threat" nearly as often as they do guns. frank crary cu boulder

(those are the extremes. most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) about 1% of those crimes are homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year. there are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year. for there to be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns. that would be very hard to do: according the the federal batf, only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. since gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed, law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) that doesn't sound like a net benefit to me. >...there were over 250 >accidental< handgun >homicides in america in 1990, most with licensed weapons. since most were with licensed weapons, i assume you are not supporting "reasonable" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background checks, licenses, etc...). since only a complete ban would alter the statistic you refer to, i assume that's what you are supporting. by the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs. 250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to other household accidents. >...more >american children accidentally shot other children last year (15) >than all the handgun homicides in great britain. 1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from drinking poisonous household chemicals (like drano), 139 from falls. if the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a better palce to start? (or, perhaps, restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers?) >...please... no dictionary arguments about rates vs >total numbers, okay? they're offered for emphasis, not comparison). while you might call it "emphasis", refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. if it isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right, the kindest thing i could call it is propaganda. frank crary cu boulder

on a los angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the family of the murdered rancher said that the los angeles sheriff's department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before the raid. this strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property; any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse. in viet nam, lt calley was tried and convicted of murder because his troops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. it is time that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to standards at least as moral as the military's. greed killed the rancher, possibly greed killed the davidian children. government greed. it is time to prosecute the leaders who perform these invasions. fred franceschi (these are my own opinions!)

i do not think it is at all unlikely that clinton ro his policy wonk facilitators arranged the waco raid as a display piece for the gun war on the constitution. look at what the bush administration did to get material for the drug war on the constitution--remember that baggie of crack george waved at the cameras? they took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the white house so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the white house lawn. and i don't think anybody could honestly think clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... the only really worrisome thing is that the bd's heroic defense of their ranch will make clinton's gun war on the constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted. the media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the bd's are bad guys! don't help them. stand up for the bd's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue. they are heroes in the fight against oppressive government; it could just as well have been you. -watkins@earth.eecs.uic.edu (brian e watkins)

well, i dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies of the national crime survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what it said about self-defense with a firearm. i haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me. first only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense. 1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon." the second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%. unless there's an explanation for this, i'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time. anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference? the survey doesn't appear to have changed significantly between 1986 and 1987. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group pa146008@utkvm1.utk.edu

a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. second, publication of some latter-day "scientific study" doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying. third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. fourth, as often happens with these things, the "study" doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies, omissions, and distortions. fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (carl bakal, author of no right to keep and bear arms, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present "study" dubious, to say the least. seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you should be better aware than most people how "progress" -- in designing "studies" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data. a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create "studies" "proving" that pornography causes crime. more naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary. ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. tenth, another reason to doubt all such "studies" is that human behavior (as the austrian school of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified. the attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization. eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. twelfth, the "study" is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social benefits. if anything, perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense. thirteenth and finally, the national rifle association officials quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are many), are correct in this instance: the "study" is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility. and because of that, adrian, even if the "study" were valid, it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. in this i'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun "while they still can". before the '68 gun control act, most of the "shooting fraternity" viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, ineffective toys. there probably weren't six million of them in the whole country. now, thanks to kennedy, metzenbaum, the bradys, and their ilk -- america's greatest sporting goods sales team -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year. the fascinating datum is that handgun control, et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so i guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are. look: gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further). even if it were difficult, there are already a quarter billion firearms in america, with an estimated "half life" of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel. guns are gonna be around a long time, adrian, whether you like it or not. as for me, to paraphrase elmer keith, regardless of what the law provides or any court decides, i'm always going to be armed. and i will always work to see that others are, as well. the bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where i come from. we can't be stopped by passing laws, we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently. so what's the point? l. neil smith author: the

i wrote : nice strawman indeed. the discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots. you claim they did. that claim is ludicrous. awesley replied: i repeated what i had been told, under what context i had heard it, supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in detroit in 67. the issue has never been whether tanks were used in detroit in 1967. it has been whether they fired their main guns. you did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were "quite" effective at this. you continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing. awesley went on: i spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was down and they don't have a card catalog. anyway, it took about 10 minutes to find this in _nightmare in detroit, a rebellion and it's victims_ by sauter and hines, on page 133, telling of the death of tonia blanding, age 4. "when the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings. after a short round into the front of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment." well, it's not the main gun. "well, it's not the main gun." gee, that's only the entire point. are you now going to admit that you were wrong? i wrote: will i see any pictures of tanks firing their main guns? will i see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells? will i read the reports of the tank fire? i'll bet you dollar to doughnuts i won't. it will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old national guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled american cities in the sixties. awesley replied: well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main guns. i will never read of tanks firing their main guns in detroit in the '67 riots. there is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later. the american military firing shells from tanks in american cities on blacks would have been *big* news. awesley goes on: you can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. to fire fragmentary grenades? i doubt that as well. to fire concussion grenades? perhaps. to fire tear gas? certainly. but you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible. and on: i don't expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually do a little research to be convinced one way or the other. let me know what you find. i already know what you found: nothing. if i claimed that the marines used f-4s to launch rockets at buildings in trenton, new jersey would you believe me? would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it? or would your bullshit filters kick in? if tanks had fired their main guns in detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades. i would know about it. unless you also claim that the national guard managed to cover it up. if your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you. i prefer to live in reality. and here in reality, i find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them. --john l. scott

recently while looking around in traders sporting goods store, a very well stocked firearms store, i discovered a printed document that was being distributed by the good folks who work there. traders, btw, is located in san leandro, ca. granted, the document may be asking you and i to help out traders, but in the big scope of things, i feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping to this cause. anyway, here it is: newspaper ad censorship are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their advertisments? the newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that traders, san leandro, has run for many years. these ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection. they certainly have the right to do so, under the second amendment right to bear arms. if you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your displeasure over their censorship doctrine. following is a list of bay area newspapers who censor gun ads. perhaps you'd like to send them your thoughts on this issue! oakland tribune		daily review		alameda times-star pob 28883		pob 5050		1516 oak st. oakland, ca 94604	hayward,94540	alameda, ca 94501 argus			tri valley herald	san leandro times 3850 decoto rd.		pob 10367		161 w. juana ave. fremont, ca 94555	pleasanton, ca 94588	san leandro, ca 94577 contra costa times	san mateo times		san francisco chronicle pob 5088		pob 5400		901 mission st. walnut creek, ca 94596	san mateo, ca 94402	san francisco, ca 94103 san fran. independent	san fran. examiner	san jose mercury news 1201 evans ave		110 5th st.		750 ridder park dr. san fran., ca 94124	san fran., ca 94103	san jose, ca 95190 then there are six pages of "facts". i can not validate these facts, and there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true. here are the topic headlines: - big media snow job - blaming firearms for murder is like blaming hospitals for death - i could use the same nazi journalistic technique of cbs and abc to prove that hospitals cause death - how nbc, cbs, and abc have scammed the american people on "gun control" - american tv journalism is based on nazi journalism - why tv journalists lie - the government with the help of the tv networks, has succeeded in playing one group against the other - gun laws are unconstitutional - american gun laws are based on nazi gun laws - the government is trying to devide and conquer - the cia wants your firearms and so on for six pages. so now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or other recreational use. let me know if you write to any of these bozos. /-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | peter d. nesbitt | air traffic controller | pnesbitt@mcimail.com | | | oakland bay tracon | | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | cbr600f2 pilot | nra member ccx1380f | s&w .41 magnum carrier | \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
|what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of |proportion. in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car |cruising around the city vs. gang members. of course the police have access |to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the |time? of course they don't and that's the point i was trying to make. every |day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in. the majority that i |see are still carrying revolvers. not that there is anything wrong with a |revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple |of automatics in his coat (i mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a |disadvantage even with training. i have been at a shooting range where gang |gang members were "practicing" shooting. they were actually practicing |taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target |and they weren't doing too badly either. the university cops here (who are |are state cops) are armed better than the chicago police. it seems most |state cops are. i don't know where you are originally from david but you live |in tennesse and i live in chicago and see this crap everyday on the news |and in the papers. i think the situation is just a tad different here |than there. however, don't forget that the police in chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the glock, which is not approved for carry (guess they figure all cops are like the police chief of winnetka, who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. this is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto uzis for his patrol cars...). perhaps in the judgement of the majority of chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. i note that in germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers. i don't think the issue is cost, because chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40k/year. your presumption of "disadvantage" i think is not borne out by the experiences of new york city's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 spl revolvers. i've seen s&ws, rugers and beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by chicago cops.... in the past, i've seen .45 m1911s; others have seen browning hi-powers... |jason

/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (strider) / 8:51 pm apr 12, 1993 / >i think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun, >but how the hell are you going to manage that? you still haven't offered i've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff "i'd rather face a knife than a gun" has got to come from ignorance! i used to think pretty much the same thing, then i got 'educated.' people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one. most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death. the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other. many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives. a gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon. a contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter. most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident. from 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill. from inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a drawn gun. a knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition. it is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder. criminals in general are young, fast and strong. it's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices. i've talked to several well trained martial artists. they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker. practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment. practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush. criminals practice their knife attacks in prison. if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground. a 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds. dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two. i've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second. i'm old, over weight and slow. i can do it in 1.3 seconds. i've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe. (how about a single stab wound to the chest with a table fork! in this case the attacker used the handle, not the pointed end.) add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.' this is true of even heart shots. there is the case of the police woman in l.a., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart. that lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it! all four of her shots, fired after she had been shot, struck the perp. atta girl! the bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen. it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole. she died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months! she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest. she was on her way home so happened to have her gun. no, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights. sigh. the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging. a good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis. people can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them. many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons. the target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.' hot .38's on up will usually do this. remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them. this the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive. i don't want to face a violent attack of any sort. knowing what i now know, i can't rightly say i'd rather face a knife than an gun. it would have to depend on the attacker, and if i could pick and choose, i wouldn't be there. this is really the bottom line. criminals do not fear the law. criminals do not fear the weapon. they fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes. rick.

>hell, a glock is the last thing that should be switched to. the only thing >that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it. sure there is >that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety. you're getting warmer. the 'little thing in the trigger' has to be depressed before the trigger can move. what this means is the damned thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled. this makes it just about (there have been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver. the gun when working correctly is totally drop safe. now, in police work this is a consideration. there is not a single documented case i'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm. there are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely prevented the office from getting shot. the purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire. this does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use! thus the glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else. by this criteria it does make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece. from the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of firing it. the ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm. rick.

(sorry colt fans. colt revolvers are ok too!) if this post had gone the other way, i'd be arguing for revolvers. :-) rick.
/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu / 6:26 am apr 14, 1993 / >	the vast majority get through life without ever having to >	own, use or display a firearm. i suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority.... you are correct about 'majority.' somewhere between 1 out of three and one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent assault. the risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke. 'vast' is probably too loose a term. with approximately 1,000,000 americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 million americans with experience in using firearms for self defense. 30/250 yields 12 percent of the population. (yes, i know that is a real rough estimate. we're closer to 270 million now, but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage if anything is low.) at any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred to as 'tiny' minorities, so i don't see how the other part of the group can be referred to as the 'vast' majority. a little more work might support a 'simple' majority of americans never use, own or display a firearm. certainly when you are talking about ownership you are wrong. nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms. >	 besides, there are other >	means of self-protection which can be just as effective >	as firearms. please provide a list of other means that are as effective. then you might convince your local police departments to switch. good luck. rick.

there's only one way i know of to tell an ar-15 from an m-16. pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely at the saftey lever. if it has two positions, its an ar-15, if it has three, its an m-16. there are numerous internal differences as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see them, they are not valid in this discussion. so, in conclusion, there is very little external differences to distinguish an ar-15 from an m-16 except at close (very close) range. david bixler auburn university all standard disclaimers apply.

(unfortunately i don't have suicide rates for norway.) however, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate. >the issue (i hope..): >i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. >guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??) > >i think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)jugoslavia: >they should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them >to kill other (innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns. the problem's been humans since before we had stone axes. the fct of the matter is simply this: if nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent. yet weapons are *built*. i'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons. anyway, the bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years. taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality. >if 50% of all murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them >or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, >it's the 'axer' ?? >(an example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...) in the u.s., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.) the reason i say that guns, per se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate. i don't really think we've got more knives or fists. in any case, i think examples of gun control *applied* to the u.s. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition. until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem. and if the problem is violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead. the *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused. (on the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun). this says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse. >think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect >themselves. is this a good situation ?? the situation is not "good" in that people fear for their lives. but recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns. would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods? >is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ?? the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles, no it isn't. however, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate. whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it. you have to examine which problem you're referring to. if you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop. (hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.) >if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have >guns) what do you think will happen ?? (i mean if everybody had a gun in usa) 45% of households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. that accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million americans. firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime. you may take that for what it's worth. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group pa146008@utkvm1.utk.edu - "i still remember the way you laughed, the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore." - "weird al"

note: these trial updates are summarized from reports in the _idaho statesman_ and the local nbc affiliate television station, ktvb channel 7. randy weaver/kevin harris trial update: day 4. friday, april 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial. synopsis: defense attorney gerry spence cross-examined agent cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor ronald howen. spence moved for a mistrial but was denied. the day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of deputy marshal larry cooper by defense attorney gerry spence. although spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent cooper. cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent degan. spence attacked cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between cooper's statements last september and those made in court. cooper conceded that, "you have all these things compressed into a few seconds...it's difficult to remember what went on first." cooper acknowledged that he carried a "9mm colt commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel." [i thought a colt commando was a revolver!] cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill weaver's dog. when spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by degan's m-16 rifle when degan was apparently dead, cooper could not say for sure that degan did not return fire before going down. spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had cooper discussed last august's events, cooper responded, "if you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor." spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the weaver's dog. cooper disagreed. assistant u.s. attorney ronald howen repeatedly objected to spence's virulent cross-examination of agent cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and spence was wasting time. howen also complained that spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events. u.s. district judge edward lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until judge lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys. "i'm not going to play games with either counsel. this has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals." spence told the judge that, "when all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent larry cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events." spence continued, "we're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of mr. cooper and the other witnesses." spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, "we can't have a fair trial if the jury believes i'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes i'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that i'm violating court orders." judge lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was "preposterous" and denied the motion for a mistrial. lodge did tell howen to restrict his comments when objecting. the trial resumed with the prosecution calling fbi special agent greg rampton. the prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: however, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address cooper's credibility. defense attorney ellison matthews (harris' other attorney) questioned rampton about the dog. rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the weaver's dog without being detected. matthews then had rampton read a septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which rampton had said that cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. rampton then acknowledged that he believed that cooper had said that, but he could not remember when. he then stated that, "i did not conduct the primary interview with deputy cooper, but i have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted." monday, april 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial. scheduled is the continued cross-examination of fbi agent greg rampton.
here is a copy of my first update on the randy weaver trial. after a large response (about 15 email messages), i've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting. *** file follows *** hi folks; as perhaps the only boise resident on the list, i guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the randy weaver/kevin harris trial. yesterday marked the seating of the jury. apparently no other legal activities occurred. the jury was selected and things start today. more interesting is what happenned outside. about a dozen weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse. one woman carried a sign that read, "who stands trial for the murder of vicki and (son's name - i forget) weaver?" on the evening news she said, "i am here protesting because i believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. i thought we all did." nice sound bite (grin)! the news reporter also interviewed some guy named "tim" who refused to give his last name. not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi. he also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. "tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of weaver and harris and the news had footage of a boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest. i don't know the finer points of this one. perhaps there's a law against political activity within x feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the first amendment?!?). most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the gestapo...err...atf with a minicam filming the protestors! welcome to the world of big brother. anyhow, gerry spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help weaver's case any. he said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that weaver would be aquitted. more stuff as it comes available. drew
hi. i've just finished reading s414, and have several questions about the brady bills (s414 and hr1025). 1. _are_ these the current versions of the brady bill? what is the status of these bills? i've heard they're "in committee". how close is that to being made law? 2. s414 and hr1025 seem fairly similar. are there any important differences i missed? 3. s414 seems to have some serious loopholes: a. s414 doesn't specify an "appeals" process to wrongful denial during the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?) (s414 has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established, but not before). b. the police are explicitly not liable for mistakes in denying/approving using existing records (so who would i sue in "a" above to have an inaccurate record corrected?) c. s414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person can convince the local chief law-enforcement officer (cleo) of an immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member. but s414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a "threat", nor does it place a limit on how long the cleo takes to issue an exception statement. true? have i misunderstood? any other 'holes? 4. with just s414, what's to stop a person with a "clean" record from buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks? at minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this? 'seems at min. a "gun counting" scheme would be needed (e.g., "john doe owns n guns"). so, if s414 passes, i wouldn't be surprised to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge i.d.'s plus national gun registration, justified by a need to make the brady bill work. please comment. i'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation--i don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed. 	marks || shepard@netcom.com

[moderator: nice summary, keith, thanks.] i talked to the federal dept. of justice (doj, ottawa) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to canadian gun laws. i am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g. 1. it is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get a concealed carry permit in canada. this is contrary to what i was told by a police officer. 2. it is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me. guns must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will be exempt or how this will be managed. this is up to each province. the general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines. apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these 'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess. dealers will be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. high capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will not be considered prohibited weapons. amendments to the regulations specify some possible methods to alter the magazines. some manufacturers (beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines. (god knows how much they'll charge for these) this covers most of what we discussed. i have typed this from memory, do not take it as gospel. i am not a lawyer and i refuse to play one on tv. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------- | keith p. de solla, p.eng | ipsc ontario, oha, nfa, sfc, ofah | | keith@orion.ic.cmc.ca | frontenac rifle and pistol club | -------------------------------------------------------------------

excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-apr-93 2nd amendment dead - good ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu > yea, there are millions of cases where yoy *say* that firearms > 'deter' criminals. alas, this is not provable. i think that that > there are actually *few* cases where this is so. excerpted from a letter i wrote a while ago: although less apparent to those who have not researched the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason as sport for the private citizen to own a gun. the most recent research is that of dr. gary kleck of the florida state university school of criminology.1 he found that handguns are more often used by victims to defeat crime than by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively in this study). these figures are even more encouraging when you consider the number of crimes that never occur because of the presence of a gun in the hands of a law-abiding private citizen. in a national institute of justice study of ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of the felons surveyed had aborted at least one crime because they believed that the intended victim was armed., and 57% agreed that "most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police."2 one of the most heinous of crimes is that against the women of this country. it has been my recent observation that more women are purchasing handguns for defense in response to the present danger of these assaults. this should be taken as encouraging news if the events of orlando florida are any indicator. in the late 1960's the female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults; just the publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in rape for that area, the only city of its size in the country to experience a decrease of crime for that year. additionally, a 1979 us justice department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate is 36%. but when a woman defends herself with a gun, the completion rate drops to 3%. 1 g kleck, point blank: guns and violence in america aldine de gruyter, ny, 1991 2 jd wright & ph rossi armed and considered dangerous: a survey of felons and their firearms, aldine de gruyter, ny, 1986 ------- __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs never scratch you when you wash them. they just become very sad and try to figure out what they did wrong. -dave barry seth eliot dept of material science and engineering carnegie mellon univerity, pittsburgh, pa arpa :eliot+@cmu.edu |------------------------------------------ or se08+@andrew.cmu.edu | bitnet: se08%andrew@cmccvb | ------------------------------|
	the debate over the second amendment rages on. arguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia" is and what trkba means in practical terms. however, the only authority in this area, is a binding court decision on the matter. even a decision in this area is subject to an overturning by a higher court. is there anyone who has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a supreme court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd amendment?

(i can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.) then they started running a "two million strong!" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership. in 1964, just after the commencement of the dodd hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the nra had a mere 625,000 members. by 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had about a million. today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to aarp and aaa). and its membership is growing faster than at any previous time.

my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos. i suggest reading massad ayoob's (i know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _the semi auto pistol in police work_ (or something like that). he defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that "different is good". the main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode. there is also a certain "propriatory nature" of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn. this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun. |> |> define "armed better". go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the |> colt .45. does one fires faster than the other? nope. aside from which |> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. sure it makes the other |> guys duck for cover, but just *you* trying hitting anything with a thompson |> in hose-mode. this is why the military is limiting it's m-16 now to |> 3-round burst-fire. simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops |> like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something |> often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful). |> |> a revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber. |> |> - a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull |> the trigger again. |> - a double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first, |> but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold. with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action. the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot. |> - a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again |> to rotate to the next round. i'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point. in a da semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now). this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation? granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go. slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time. |> - a revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the |> hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an |> easy motion, even one handed. actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended. a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off. |> -

the partial magazine can still be used if needed later). |> |> - a misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell |> first, time spent which can be fatal. and a vital second or so is often |> lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything |> about clearing it. yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it. really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small. you are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (sigs, glocks, et.al.). |> -

103d congress 1st session h. r. 1276 to establish the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and to provide for the enforcement of such right. ======================= in the house of representatives march 10, 1993 mr. bartlett introduced the following bill; which was referred to the committee on the judiciary ======================= a bill to establish the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and to provide for the enforcement of such right. be it enacted by the senate and house of representa- tives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the "citizens' self-defense act of 1993". sec. 2. right to obtain firearms for security, and to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home; enforcement. (a) establishment of right. -- a person not pro- hibited by federal law from receiving a firearm shall have the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use fire- arms in defense of self, family, or home. (b) firearm defined. -- as used in subsection (a), the term "firearm" means a -- (1) shotgun (as defined in section 921(a)(5) of title 18, united states code); (2) rifle (as defined in section 921(a)(7) of such title); or (3) handgun (as defined in section 10 of public law 99-408). (c) enforcement of right. -- (1) in general. -- a person whose right under subsection (a) is violated in any manner may bring an action in any united states district court against the united states, any state, or any person for damages, injunctive relief, and such other relief as the court deems appropriate. (2) authority to award a reasonable at- torney's fee. -- in an action brought under para- graph (1), the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than a state, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs. (d) statute of limitations. -- an action may not be brought under subsection (c)(1) after the 5-year period that begins with the date the violation described therein is discovered. ------------------------ (end of hr 1276) ------------------------ well, this sounds good to me. the key is section (2)(c)(2), which will effectively open up the federal court system to all the folks who can't afford to adopt an attorney with whom to fight city hall. all of you who've been saying "hey, isn't that illegal?" could just go hire your own attorneys on a pay-if-you-win ("contingency fee") basis, and sue the bums ... :-) what you can do now: (1) write your representative, and ask them to co-sponsor hr 1276. (2) write representative roscoe bartlett, the sponsor -- representative roscoe bartlett 312 cannon house office building washington, d.c. 20515 -- to tell him who your own representative is, and that you've asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of hr 1276. (3) contact gun owners of america -- gun owners of america 8001 forbes place springfield, virginia 22151 -- which has committed to lobby on behalf of hr 1276. (4) for those of us with a realjob (tm), find out how to reach representative bartlett's campaign fund (i'm working on it) and toss in a few bucks. you can bet your bippy that he's going to be one of the hci "targets" in the next election, which isn't that far away (1994).

you know, i was reading 18 u.s.c. 922 and something just did not make sence and i was wondering if someone could help me out. say u.s.c. 922 : (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun. well i got to looking in my law dictionary and i found that a "person" might also be an artificial entity that is created by government and has no rights under the federal constitution. so, what i don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on an individual. so someone tell me how my government can tell me what i can or cannot possess. just passing a law does not make it law. everyone knows that laws are constitional until it goes to court. so, has it ever gone to court, not just your run of the mill "ok i had it i am guilty, put me in jail" has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told by the supreme court that they didn't have that right? -- brian sheets		 _ /| 	"truck?! what truck?" support engineer 	 \`o_o' 	 atlas telecom inc.

i hate long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy.... overall crime rate: it fell....just like that... acquiring weapons in norway: you can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in norway, but you must have a permit, and a good reason to get the permit.... if i would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from the police and to be a member of a gun-club. the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and/or records of serious mental diseases. now, if a got my licence, i would have to be an active member of the gun -club for 6 months before i could collect my gun. it's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to... use of guns in crimes (in norway): some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short time befor the crime. use of knives: it is allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. you (americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open in public -rigth ?? scandinavians are 'aggressive': we northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide to take action we do. ask any historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....

anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one. if you carry any pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going off are about zero. unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a couple of minutes or put it in a fire. :-) -- +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | "what doesn't kill us makes us stronger" spoken by many a.t. hikers | | kilo delta four zulu papa uniform -kd4zpu 146.82 +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

(are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.) >the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and/or >records of serious mental diseases. this has been suggested in the u.s., and generally supported among gun owners. what many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of "gotcha" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way. >now, if a got my licence, i would have to be an active member of the gun >-club for 6 months before i could collect my gun. >it's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? >you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to... at this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the u.s. is for the most part nothing like its european counterpart. i understand getting one is far more difficult there than here. in the u.s. it's a joke. but my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things. for instance, in the u.s. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road. it is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property. that is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands. a permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property. >use of guns in crimes (in norway): >some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' >for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. >most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short >time befor the crime. > >use of knives: >it is allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. >you (americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open >in public -rigth ?? this varies *widely*. (one thing i think europeans have a difficult time with is that the u.s. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in europe to another). some places allow open carry of both guns and knives. some allow concealed. some prohibit both, or allow one or the other. and it can be either a state or local restriciton. >individual vs masses: >yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some >extent.... >your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? >what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of >all the others ?? the question must be asked: is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual. what we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as "people who own guns,") are adversely affecting the rights of some other group. if for instance, "bob" were using his gun to attack "steve," you'd have a point. but essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group "people who own guns" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights. it's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one. >the issue: >i believe the issue is guns, and gun-legislation. the issue is crime, violence, and murder. the question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those. >we shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one.... >if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home. >but should it have to be like that ?? of course not. it would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. but currently we don't have that option. nor do i expect we will. >do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ?? no state does. in any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's "wisdom" on me. freedom in general is an unwise concept. if you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be "unwise" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept. >if you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence why do you think >it should be free to buy guns ?? i'll raise my hand against driver's licenses. as currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignored by a startling number of drivers. it does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car. but, as i mentioned, they're two different things. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group pa146008@utkvm1.utk.edu - "i still remember the way you laughed, the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore." - "weird al"

aclu official policies. policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion pictures: "industry sponsored ratings systems create the potential for constraining the creative process and thus contracting the marketplace of ideas. despite the stated goal of providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of expression." in regards to the pledge of allegiance, the aclu states in its policy 84: "the insertion of the words `under god' into the pledge of allegiance is a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of church and state." policy 120 states that, "military conscription under any circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and constitutional guarantees." the aclu objects to the draft even during wartime because of the "anti-democratic power it gives government to wage war without support of the people." policy 125 states, "the aclu calls for a broad-based inquiry into war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the actions of the united states military and other combatants against the people of south vietnam, laos, cambodia, and north vietnam." policy 133 states, "the aclu recognizes that us government reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign and domestic policy, while propounded as a defense of democracy, is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. four decades of adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount threat to our civil liberties." policy 217 objects to roadblocks "where drivers are stopped for sobriety tests" because they "violate fourth amendment principles." policy 242 states the following on criminal sentencing: "the most appropriate correctional approach is reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the offender within the community than by incarceration. probation should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made, should be limited to the most serious of offenses, such as murder or treason." bill vojak vojak@icebucket.stortek.com 				nra, ila, colorado firearms coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ the cbs nightly propaganda with dan rather.

upi washington dc, update desk			4/15/93 for the past several months the clinton administration has been stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy. while most leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area of jobs creation. the unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark. last month, in an effort to understand this problem, president clinton appointed a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting economic signals. this panel was chaired by vice president gore. today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion. "it's the guns" vice president gore said. apparently nra members, and other "gun-nuts" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the economy out of the recession. "their buying them five times faster than ever before, and stockpiling left and right", the vice president said. however, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several declarations of bankruptcy by many leading american gun makers, they have not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand. "we want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people", said the president of colt industries. "as long as clinton is in office, we suspect it will", he added. in response to this new information, president clinton announced a new gun control measure to be introduced into congress this session. it's called the "ban-one-a-month" gun control bill. under the terms of this law, every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index cards. the cards will all be put in a big hat and the president will draw one card every month. sixty days later that gun will be banned from any further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the politically connected and to members of the national police force. the president said, "this law will benefit america two ways. when the gun-of-the-month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more. in addition, over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the street." he also announce the appointment of sarah brady to oversee this program, citing her "honesty, and unbiased view on the subject of gun control". senators metzenbaum, deconcini, feinstein, and boxer have proposed an amendment to the bill which would add additional index cards containing caliber designations for all know ammunitions. "their stockpiling, stockpiling, stockpiling" screamed metzenbaum during a press conference at the national headquarters of handgun control inc. senators simon, metzenbaum, and moyenhan also introduced an amendment that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been drawn from the hat. senator simon was quoted as saying, "first we'll fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning", during a press conference he held in the second floor mens restroom of the senate building. he of course was referring to the fact that he would allow the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require the batf to seize all of the guns in america sometime in the year 2008, after all of the cards have been drawn. the head of the batf responded by saying, "we will have to see if this thing in waco is over by then. we may be too busy to seize all those guns". us house representatives pat schroeder and david skaggs of colorado declared this proposed law as being "reasonable gun control which won't affect anybodys constitutional right to own sporting guns". - end article - for the humor impaired :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) bill vojak vojak@icebucket.stortek.com 				nra, ila, colorado firearms coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ the cbs nightly propaganda with dan rather.

(there are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the us every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.) i don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he gets one. just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- if they couldn't be abused by the government. but they already have! one state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections. is this fair? > most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short > time befor the crime. and how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? how many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market? > use of knives: > it is allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. > you (americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open > in public -rigth ?? some states allow only open carry. some allow only concealed carry. some allow both. some allow both, but require licenses for concealed carry. all you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators someplace are doing exactly the wrong thing. which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern. > scandinavians are 'aggressive': > we northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide > to take action we do.

[this is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.] gun owners action league, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. it was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud. mike yacino of goal spoke. one of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of "election fraud" to hold their jobs. nancy snow and amos hamburger were busy handing out id buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were). mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list. it seems a delegation of students from simon's rock of bard college (alma mater of wayne lo, who shot up the place with an sks late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident. the hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) gardner auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the governor's hearings on the framingham eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release). so we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room. one of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. he said, "oh, it must be gun hearings day again! the gun lobby is always so organized every year." i got a little pissed, and replied, "i'm not from the gun lobby -- i'm from your district." at 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't). randy price from the tv news was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several simon's rock anti-gun "close-the-loophole" protestors. (earlier, randy had covered the goal rally.) the room we had been assigned seated about 50. remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from bard. one of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind him. a cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in. soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else. everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills. most of us signed up to "support goal's position" on "all bills." first, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify. and first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, i guess). currently, massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state. previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining massachusetts. the simon's rock folks called the current law a "loophole" and wanted it closed. two of their reps spoke about wayne lo and his "sks assault rifle." the second one, hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing montana (wayne lo's home state) with missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff. carr, from gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states only if they have licensing in their own state "as strong as" that in massachusetts. since none of them do, that's that. some of the things these two said were really offensive. "in some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!" (oooooo!) "we have some very, very good gun laws in massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't." (naughty, naughty!) next up was boston city councilman albert "dapper" o'neill. he was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability. he's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician. he badmouthed the aclu, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their "last rights" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) he said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals. he said this four times :-( two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a ccw or fid, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you. (note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.) senator barrett of reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, "i'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted." i haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since nixon whined that he wasn't a crook. barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the fid card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now. the stated purpose is to remove fid cards from those who have become ineligible. "revenue has nothing to do with it." (yeah, right.) apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time. as usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook. the two co-chairs of the committee were rep. caron and sen. jujuga. jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both "restraining order" bills) but caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged. (he was a co-sponsor of one of the "restraining order" bills as well.) one of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so. his heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, "every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap..." it's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective. at about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected. so they found a bigger hall upstairs. one of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the "public" testimony; the other got a seat this time. caron began by talking about how he got his fid 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. he complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his pd back in his city of birth still thought he lived there. great quote: "if you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999." (this was also an argument he used against the renewable fid card.) testimony was heard from several "battered women," one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an fid card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts. they used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men. a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected. caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year. he asked whether she would be satisfied if the fid were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the fid. she gave some long rambling circumlocution in response. then testimony against the bill was heard. mike yacino (who looks something like einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. atty. karen mcnutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony. other pro-gunners got up to testify. one said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him! he noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. one of the junior reps noted that "this is america" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected. senator jujuga reiterated this, saying that "people who abuse smaller people can go to hell as far as i care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order." (point and match, senator.) another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship "expired every 5 years," and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms. a third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings. senator jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings. the speaker then responded, "i'll make you a deal. you get me the rope, and i'll tie the noose." next came public testimony on the simon's rock bill. a teacher testified that she had been the teacher of wayne lo, and that "he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside" without his evil gun. she said that the "loophole" should be closed to prevent something like this from "ever happening again". four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators. one of the students actually shot by wayne lo was also there. many of them had t shirts on, saying, "as long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control." the committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an fid. "only residents can get fid's," he said. (how much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?) yacino and mcnutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all guns possessed by out-of-staters. karen also noted that hunters in ct, nh, and vt could be put away for a year if they wandered across the ma boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens. yacino underscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resident student -- and, hell, even an ccw, as he had no criminal or mental record. one junior rep was upset that it would take ma residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was "elitist". another (caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an fid because only two other states in the union had "fid-type" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was "not enough." one pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, "everyone's out of step but johnny!" all the bard college people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration. the main bills remaining (and goal's position) were: o h.4375 and four others: notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported) o h.1732: require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed) o h.962: require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly opposed) o h.1350: allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws (opposed) o h.1731: fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported) o s.1097: state constitutional amendment for the rkba (supported) o several on police discretion in the issuance of fid cards (opposed) o several altering non-resident license conditions (supported) o h.1135: ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!) some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them. mike yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked. caron blew right through h.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, "this would create hundreds of different licensing systems." the session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified. it ended at about 6:30. -- cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com --if you believe that i speak for my company, or cdt@vos.stratus.com write today for my special investors' packet...

i don't know what traders is claiming, but it appears to me that the oakland tribune has censored gun ads in the past. likewise for the san francisco chronicle, and i have never seen a gun ad in the san francisco examiner. specifically, about a year ago on thursdays, when traders placed its ads, the chron. ad would not have any graphics representing any handgun sale, though text could list it. the trib. would run a graphic of a handgun. the examiner would not have a traders ad at all. over the past year while oakland politicians have made a lot of noise about measures to fight crime the trib stopped taking the traders ad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then stopped, then started. since the trib. was sold some months ago it has not had the traders ad. during one of these non-ad interludes a traders employee told me that the trib. had refused to take their ads. yes, the usual chron. thursday ad was there today, with graphics representing rifles, safes, etc. as usual. joan v
>> do you know how many deaths each year are caused by self-inflicted gun- >> shot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters? there are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year. the large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. i really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of "self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters" is probably well under 250 per year. >>if you fall, for example, >> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge. handguns designs have included a "hammer block" since around 1960 or earlier. this is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: even under impact, the gun cannot fire. the hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. as a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) >> the number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of >> deaths caused by animal attacks or "wacko" attacks combined. i don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. if only 2.1% of the murders were killings by "wacko"s, you would be wrong. worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated assaults each year. these numbers make violent attacks, and preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the accidents you are worried about. (these figures, by the way, are from the fbi's "uniform crime report" for 1990. i'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at the "national crime victimization survey", which is more specific about where and when the crimes occured.) frank crary cu boulder
dennis deconcini, 1982 ...in these and similar areas, the bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5 u.s.c. sec 552, which was intended to prevent "secret lawmaking" by administrative bodies. these practices, amply documented in hearings before this sub- committee, leave little doubt that the bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the united states. it has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens. it has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property. it has ignored the fifth amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law. the rebuttal presented to the subcommittee by the bureau was utterly unconvincing. richard davis, speaking on behalf of the treasury department, asserted vaguely that the bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. he also asserted that the bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. no documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. in hearings before batf's appropriations subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of batf gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations. ( exerpt from: 97th congress; 2d session committee print t h e r i g h t t o k e e p a n d b e a r a r m s report of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary united states senate ninety-seventh congress second session february, 1982 printed for the use of the committee on the judiciary u.s. government printing office 88-618 o washington : 1982 letter to constituent: april 1993 thank you for contacting me regarding the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (atf), which is the federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations. it has been my experience as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on treasury, postal service and general government which funds atf, that atf is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the federal government. the agents of atf have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of drug-related crimes. it enforces the armed career criminal act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out an illegal activity. the bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons. the waco, texas case involved the execution of search warrants by atf on the branch davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.) in virtually every gun case, atf is asked to trace weapons through its' national firearms tracing center, where they keep all dealer and federal firearms license information. atf is the federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants. atf, working with state and local law enforcement in texas and the u.s. attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the branch davidians. in addition, atf carefully selected a sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored. as you may be aware by now, vernon howell a.k.a. david koresh spiritual leader of the branch davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants. unfortunately, atf lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves and prepare for atfs' entry into the compound. once a hostage situation presented itself, the atf asked the fbi to become involved since the fbi is skilled in hostage negotiations. in addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the branch davidians. based on what i have learned about atf's role in the branch davidian raid, i believe the agency acted responsibly. i am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult. i fully expect the department of treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the department to be headed by the assistant secretary for enforcement. in addition, atf will conduct its' own review of the waco operation. i look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion. sincerely, dennis deconcini chairman subcommittee on treasury, postal service and general government april 7, 1993 -- larry cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range. my point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line. is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction? to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. perhaps sen. metzenbaum declaring the barrett light fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the barrett has only range and acurracy going for it. >they have determined that their lives are worth the effort to >protect their homes and families. using nuclear weapons close >to home will not accomplish this. 	i disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once i have died. i assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned. if this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit. personally, my home is worth, say, twenty martians intent on taking over the world. my family? all of them. the balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk. >there is, however, another problem: in any case of civil war, >the strength of the militias fighting on each side should >reflect the popular will. if the public is split 67% versus >33%, then the minorities' militias should be at a 2:1 disadvantage. >such a

if the 33% minority included all the >tank and artillery owners? 	that seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry. with such low numbers, obviously due to cost, i don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe. furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness. >i think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small >minority would have a reasonable

lesser of two evils. >whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body, >responsive to the will of the people. 	i had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons. but, if joe bob owns an old sherman tank i certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up. follow orders from the officers, yes. since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated. >here, i think we have to be carefull about _which_ "state" we >are talking about: certainly one role of the militia is to >overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely >destructive to that end for that same government to control >the militia's arms. but the united states have several levels >of government, each able to act independently, but not all >likely targets of rebelion. >as such, rebelions against state and >local governments are very unlikely. i think, therefore, that the >state (or possibly local) governments could safely be allowed to >keep the select militia's heavy weapons. the risk of abuse, while >still something to consider, is far less than the similar risk >were the federal government in control. 	this i'll agree with to a point. the state having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located. keep them spread out, such that the ability of the state to lock them up isn't so easy. otherwise, i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militia officers. >that is eaxctly why i think they should be removed: the select >militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained >specialists. for the reasons i have outlines above, i think >these heavy weapons (tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc...) are >better off being kept by local governments than by a small >number of

militia. similarly, the >select militia should be incapable of action without the >aid of the general militia. 	i'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support. just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, i can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. i think a better mix is called for. but, i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units. >consider, then, the effect of removing the national guard's >infantry and placing the guard under the control of local >governments. the government-controled select militia could >not fight effectively without infantry support provided by >the general militia (an inherently infantry organization.) >on the other hand, the general militia could function (although >at a disadvantage) without the backing of local governments and >the select militia. 	we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. i'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory. these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. i suppose i'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment. >>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds >>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and >>the like. > >i would much rather see these things handled by the local, >general militias. 	so would i, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough. thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else. >perhaps the national guard isn't as close to my conception of >the select militia as i thought: i was considering them to >be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry >arm of the regular army. 	perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different? i think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff. m113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, humvee's, old m60 tanks, 105 howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry. actually, this is what the guard units in iowa are currently fielding in some units. 	perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under state control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent. allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks. similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry. finally, the militia is more than just fighting. equipment is needed for other responses. the federal army, i'm convinced, should have a very minumum of

a few comments on the atf's botched handling of this case: 1. attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight? the explanation we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult members would be at religious services. my only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit, you'd better understand basic military tactics. one cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously. 2. we were told that atf got four agents killed because they were outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance. when questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily armed. can you say contradictory? i knew you could! 3. the batf has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant, hotdoggers. i was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of crockett and tubbs wannabes. i'm more than ever convinced that's right on target. an anecdote not related to the waco fiasco is that apparently the batf screwed up some of the evidence in the world trade center bombing. there's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the fbi will not be admissible in court. this is not hearsay. i was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an fbi agent. his opinion of the batf was, ummm, well, let's just say uncomplimentary. 4. i have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that the bd's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the reason for the raid in the first place. btw, we're *still* hearing this justification. ag reno, on cnn yesterday, made references to this issue, without any substantiation. she also waved around the "he's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!" flag. sigh. 5. a point re the feds in general: their handling of the whole siege reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought processes of the cultists. ag reno said they pushed the button because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing. my only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in the walls and cs gas pumped in? if i were a bd, i'd expect the forces of the godless government to assault me at any time. in that light, whether they torched themselves or drank jim jones kool-aid is irrelevant. also, look at how the siege was conducted: bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and other contact with the outside. all measures designed to make the bd's feel more and more isolated and threatened. this might have been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals. as it was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into koresh's paranoid delusions. -- #include <std_disclaimer.h> dan s.

what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf. if they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. the batf needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. if you are going to do a job then do it right. the batf is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job. with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours. with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later.

posted by cathy smith for l. neil smith weird science everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying: his lips move. what may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase "political science" is subject to more than one interpretation. years ago, we heard how "scientists" were worried that a new ice age might be coming, and later on that "nuclear winter" -- smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international unpleasantness -- was a possibility. something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs. what we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, that real-world events (the burning of kuwaiti oil fields) tended to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made america the most successful culture in history, and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the plague when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs. we miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely. prince william sound, site of the famous oil spill, and mount st. helen's weren't supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 100 years. that turned out not to be true, although you'd never know it from watching network nightly news or cnn. it doesn't fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be. but for once, the media aren't entirely to blame. as ignorant of science as they are of everything, they trust "scientists" to unscrew the inscrutable. the trouble is that today's "scientists" have agendas of their own. nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for "global warming". the money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable. the same appears true of "acid rain", a deliberate hoax cooked up by the environmental protection agency (which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much. the list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread. "ozone depletion", for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on. decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society, the freer that individual -- and his society -- become. honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have been suppressed, most recently by the california state government. and what the media didn't say about recent epa "discoveries" on the effect of "secondhand smoking" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird. it's enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer. that, of course, is the real threat represented by politically correct science. the world is a dangerous place. it would be nice to know the hazards. i've never believed smoking to be a healthy practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's science, how am i to decide what to do about it? nicotine is highly addictive, to that much i can attest from experience. yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue. there isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment. two centuries ago, the founding fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion. each time some short-sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street -- has wound up being shed. real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the epa, of livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, when they die from the effects of obesity. what we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries, is another barrier, a constitutional separation of state and science -- including medicine. knowledge is valuable; real science won't languish for lack of funding. the money will simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and everyone will benefit. l. neil smith author: the probability broach, the crystal empire, henry martyn, and (forthcoming) pallas lever action bbs (303) 493-6674, fidonet: 1:306/31.4 libertarian second amendment caucus nra life member my opinions are, of course, my own.

note: these trial updates are summarized from reports in the _idaho statesman_ and the local nbc affiliate television station, ktvb channel 7. randy weaver/kevin harris trial update: day 5. monday, april 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial. synopsis: government informant kenneth fadeley testified that randy weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the national firearms act of 1934. u.s. district court judge edward lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the waco fire because of possible influences on the weaver/harris case. the testimony of fbi special agent greg rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by ktvb nor the _idaho statesman_. the day was highlighted by the testimony of kenneth fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named gus magiosono. fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms in his dealings with randy weaver. fadeley began by stating that he had met weaver in 1987 at an aryan nations summer conference in hayden lake, idaho. the two then met again october 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in sandpoint, idaho, to begin a weapons transaction. he stated that weaver had said, "he felt like he (weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the white cause." the two later met october 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale. during this second meeting, fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation. weaver allegedly showed him an h&r 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches. he additionally showed a remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (nfa requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches). on tape, weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up. the two then discuss the possibility of future sales. fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet. (note that the atf could have simply arrested him here. why did they wait until january 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him? this is not explained). the next meeting took place on nov 30, 1989. fadeley stated that his "source" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised. at this point, weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, "i had a guy in spokane tell me you were bad." fadeley managed to convince weaver otherwise. the _idaho statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with randy weaver. thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded. however, the _statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving vicki weaver (randy weaver's wife) was played to the court. there must have also been phone taps. these tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of gerry spence, weaver's attorney. spence said to a ktvb reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, "...if it has a case at all..." according to the rules. randy weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape. u.s. district court judge edward lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the waco fire because of possible influences on the weaver/harris case. exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained. other notes: sunday evening there was a report on ktvb concerning kevin harris. unnamed agents within the fbi admit that they are surprised that kevin harris is still alive. first, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the y-junction. later, when randy weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that harris had been struck (not weaver). finally, there was a report that the fbi agent who killed vicki weaver believed he was aiming at kevin harris instead. (this is what was reported). critics are charging that the fbi was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of samuel weaver and deputy marshal william degan. some local people believe that harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention. tuesday, april 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. kenneth fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

ever since the siege at waco started the fbi spokesman has been stressing how unstable and paranoid david koresh was. he stressed how likely it was the the branch davidians would commit mass suicide. he was concerned with the safety of the children. what did the fbi do to defuse the situation, did they try to reassure koresh? did the fbi offer medical assistance to the bd? did the fbi offer them a supply of water when the bd pump stoped working? did the permit koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? what the fbi did was harass the branch davidians as much as possible. they kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter. the stated goal was to put pressure on david koresh. was the fbi attempting to get koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks. it appears that the tactics employed by the fbi did drive koresh over the edge. the blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove koresh over the edge and the fools at the atf who planed the raid. stupidity and incompetence of the batf and the fbi leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people. if every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today. instead the atf screwed up and caused the death of 90+. incompetent law enforcement can kill you! -- rod anderson n0nzo | the only acceptable substitute boulder, co | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | -solomon short- satellite n0nzo on ao-16 |

"instead, we are faced with devastation and death. however, i have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with extreme professionalism and care. i applaud the restraint shown by agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire, and i thank them for risking their lives to try to end this peacefully. i have only the greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all involved." -30-

could someone email me a usnail address for the nra? i'd like to write them a letter encouraging them to see to it very emphatically that the 2nd amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended. people like howard metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they did in waco. after all, from what i know of the federalist papers, it is this kind of tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against. honestly! m-60 tanks against the civilian population! attack helicopters! we need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. actually, if they intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population, we need the right to field tactical nukes. government tyranny! who would have ever thought it would happen here! i wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov. suspects child abuse. maybe yours! maybe mine! and what is an illegal weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the 2nd amendment is designed to do what i believe it is, and the gov. uses tanks against you? government self-serving? naaaah. not here. time was when the u.s. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries. now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a half of civilians. "first they came for the jews, but i did not stop them, because i was not a jew: then they came for the catholics, but i did not stop them because i was not a catholic! then they came for the lutherans, but there was now no one left to stop them!" rev. martin niemoller.

i have been convinced of the right of americans to an effective self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the pro-rkba arguments presented here. the numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me. likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?). however, it is surprising that the "evil antigun empire " (darth vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare "all legitimate gun defenses" vs. "all gun crimes." instead, it's always "all legitimate gun defenses," which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died. why is this? of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide. whereas in the legitimate gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred. -case kim kim39@husc.harvard.edu

awesley wrote: that was the entire point to *you*. what exactly did i claim? -------------------------------------------------- "i've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire. quite effectively." -------------------------------------------------- i wasn't wrong . . . i've heard those descriptions. if you're paying attention, i've mentioned that i saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account i heard. that helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, "bullshit filters". stating that i *claimed* this is a falsehood. later in the same post: another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble. based on what i remember, i was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two. fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are "inclined" to. see below for a stronger statement of your beliefs). those claims are still ludicrous, however. previously awesley had written: you can also read of the troops using grenade launchers. prompting me to write: to fire fragmentary grenades? i doubt that as well. to fire concussion grenades? perhaps. to fire tear gas? certainly. but you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible. to which awesley replied: john, again, strawman techniques. do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what i said and knock that down? what i read said nothing about what they fired. and so i put nothing in there. if you need some help, let me know and i'l take your side of this for a while. you're not scoring here, you're boring here. but why did you mention grenade launchers at all? because it supports the notion that the tanks shelled buildings. and it supports that notion because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades. but that too is ludicrous. i wrote: if tanks had fired their main guns in detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades. i would know about it. awesley relied: glad to know you're such an expert. nice to hear some an authority. i especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it. since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the detroit riot. some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300. the offical number is 43 but the concise columbia encyclopedia says it was "several". i've also heard some things about that but i won't dare repeat them. you'd assert that i claimed they were truth. yes, if it happened i would have heard about it. everybody would have. army tanks don't fire their cannons in american cities in the 1960's without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying "this has gone far enough." so, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis for my disbelieving the claim. now i have more reasons to disbelieve it. not one poster has written to say, yes, i lived in detroit at that time and everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells. this is the usenet. if it had happened, somebody here would remember it. furthermore, your own research failed to come up with any support for the claim. the claim is extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit. i do not. i wrote: unless you also claim that the national guard managed to cover it up. awesley wrote: taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the difference between army and guard troops. or so i recall from 26 years ago. and i seem to recall it was the army running the tanks. so it would have been an army cover-up. quibble. fine, it was an army cover-up. six years in the reserves has taught me the difference also. but do you think that in two and half decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said "yes, i shelled americans," or "i gave the orders to fire the cannons," or "i helped cover it up"? i wrote: if your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you. i prefer to live in reality. and here in reality, i find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them. awesley replied: given the level in destruction in detroit, i'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns. good. then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known? awesley concludes: now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the account i cited. actually, now we have established that i don't believe what you believe, as well as why i don't believe it. and if it's boring, then i yield the last word to you, if you want it. you may say anything you like with impunity--i am dropping the subject. --john l. scott
i was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was "luser!" that was certainly not my intention. i meant to leave the subject line unchanged. i believe that the nntp server i use at columbia must have put in that subject line in protest over problems with my header. that was rather rude of them, but beggars can't be choosers, i suppose. in any case, i didn't do it and i apologize to awesley for the apparent insult. --john l. scott

and in order to see that this be not neglected, it 	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of 	a year. but, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year. just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it requires a continually standing committee of organizers. since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a "well regulated militia" is not well organized. but i will concide a "well organized militia" is not necessarily a "well regulated militia." several people have stated that the "well organized militia" is what is defined under 10 usc 311, which states 	the militia of the united states consists of all able-bodied 	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in 	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, 	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, 	citizens of the united states and of female citizents of 	the united states who are commissioned officers of the 	national guard. this deos define the militia, but were is the adjective "well regulated." 10 usc 311 does not define a "well regualed militia" in any way, shape, or form. it only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia the federalist papers clearly define the "well regualed militia" as a proper subset of the militia. in the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above "disciplining all the militia of the united states" so they fit the "character of a well-regulated militia." this is what the paragraph states about the associated costs: 	it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the 	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short 	of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all 	the states. to attempt a thing which would abridge the 	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, 	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not 	succeed, because it would not long be endured. another quote provide by charles scripter is: james madison, federalist paper 41 (regarding the "general welfare" clause): 	"nothing is more natural nor common than first 	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a 	recital of particulars." so the phrase "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed" must either qualify or explain the phrase "a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state." the definition of "explain" as stated in "the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language" the new college edition, 1982 is: 	1) to make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from; 	 elucidate: "it was the economists who undertook to explain 	 this puzzle" 	2) to define; explicate; expound: he explained his plan. 	3) to offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify: 	 explain an error the second phrase clearly does not "explain" the first, therefore the second phrase must "qualify" the first. the definition given for "qualify" is: 	1) to describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities 	 of; characterize. 	2) to make competent or suitable for office, position, or 	 task. 	3) to give legal power to; make legally capable. 	4) to modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions. 	5) to make less harsh or severe; moderate 	6) grammar: to modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) since "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. by process of elimination it must fall into definition #3. and since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case. therefore, "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" gives legal power to the "well regualated militia" and this legal power "shall not be infringed". i thank you very much mr scripter, you have provided me with more evidence that the second amendment only concerns itseft with the people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little about the right of an untrained person to "keep and bear" a .50 caliber machine gun. and since i, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something i personly have meant to correct by going to a nra gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, i conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me. -> so now we know which category mr. rutledge is in; he means to destroy -> our liberties and rights. i mean "to destory our liberties and rights." is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what "our libertues and rights" are? i force my version of "our liberties and rights" by begining statements of what "our liberties and rights" with "all that the second amendment clearly states to me." using expressions, such as "states to me," clearly mean i intend to force my views on others? i don't think so. so in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our liberties and rights," i state that nothing i have written, or will write, in the matter of "liberties and rights" is the final word. for i am only one person among many and the final word on "liberties and rights" cleary and irrevocably belongs to the many. +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+ | | "if only it were a modern document, with a | | john lawrence rutledge | smart index and hyper links stretching all | | research assistant | through the world data net. it was terribly | | | frustrating to flip back and forth between | | interactive media group | the pages and crude flat illustrations that | | computer science department | never even moved. nor were there animated | | umass - lowell | arrows or zoom-ins. it completely lacked a | | 1 university ave. | for sound. | | lowell, ma 01854 | "most baffling of all was the problem of new | | | words... in normal text you'd only have to | | (508) 934-3568 | touch an unfamiliar word and the definition | | jrutledg@cs.ulowell.edu | would pop up just below." | | | from david brin's "earth" | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

fact: both janet reno and bill clinton have admitted responsibility, even grief, over the deaths in waco. fact: regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two. cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?) come to mind. fact: it is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty of life in prison. fact: impeachment is allowable for "high crimes and misdemeanors." anything that's a federal felony should qualify. conclusion: we have no choice, if we are an honest people, but to impeach mr. clinton, and remove reno from office. glenn r. stone (glenns@eas.gatech.edu) wearer of asbestos underoos

a couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there: question #1 according to the nra/ila state firearms lawbook, in wisconsin it is 'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a "concealed and dangerous weapon." there is no statutory provision for obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.' * jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use. does this mean that open carry is allowed? if so, just how 'open' does it have to be? would an in the pants holster be considered concealing? what if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon? also, is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed, period? question #2 as i understand it, in evanston, il, they have a ordinance banning handguns. is there any way to get around this provision? what would the penalty if you were found out be? what if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there? how would the city law apply to your impending trial for the shooting? also, what is il state law concerning short barreled weapons? short barreled shotgun is what i would be interested in if a handgun were not available, either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie colt, marlin). one more thing, what is the chance of getting a ccw permit in il without being rich or famous or related to the mayor? please send replies via e-mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g a little faster than i can handle. thanks again ------- steve syck syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu --------

just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (ap, etc.) that there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires. it has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause. what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident. i believe the moves made were right and proper, but i still have some problems with some of the tactics. after watching the abc special on it tonight, as well as cnn and nightline, i question some of the atf and fbi actions. 1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at some time before the feb. 28th raid? 2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome. 3) were fbi actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action? and a few other questions. like i said, i believe the actions taken, in general, were proper. but i still have some reservations. one other point, i'm no fan of janet reno, but i do like the way she had the "balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.
first, i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as mr. rutledge with whom to discuss this topic. frankly, most anti-rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the writings of the era. this is most refreshing. second, i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. my brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the state militia. some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. i'm not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia, both organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my state, mississippi. please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. for instance, the commonwealth of massachusetts has a well organized militia which, members report, maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. the laws of other states will vary but are probably similar. title 35 of mississippi code defines our militia as "all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years...". the militia is divided into 3 classes: the national guard, the mississippi state guard and the unorganized militia. the national guard is a strange sort of fish from a constitutional perspective. it tries to be both state militia and federal reserve. the discussion of this "para-constitutional" arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. suffice it that, at this date, the national guard has ceased to have any constitutional standing as anything but a federal reserve force. mississippi, and most other states, maintains a purely state organized militia. in mississippi this is called the state guard. in other states it may be called something else. the state guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior ncos who serve as volunteers without compensation. we drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. our state-authorized cadre strength is 694. this is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. the muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized militia. in time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the governor can order the activation of the state guard. when this takes place a call will first be made for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. in the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized militia. the size of the state guard is not specified by law, but rather by executive order. at one time, the organized militia of mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. needless to say, the state does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. the historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the militiamen. it is my hope that demonstrates that state militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim. >no, i simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well >organized militia." and i have also stated that a militia that >meets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized." and this >state of readiness that i have claimed the people have a "right" >to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated >by hamilton. regarding hamilton: if you take hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the founding fathers, you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. hamilton was on the extreme federalist end of the political spectrum. others, such as coxe and henry, can be chosen to represent the other end. many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing army of any sort or even a select militia or "train bands" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. the compromise reached was to provide for a small army, which had to be refinanced every two years, and iron-clad protection for the militia, which was to remain ever, "terrible and irresistible". these protections included: state control, not federal; limitation of federal utilization of the militia (i.e. execute laws, suppress insurrections and repel invasions), and the right to keep and bear arms to prevent what the british had tried to do at lexington. these limitations eventually proved so onerous to the federal govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the national guard. the national guard was created for one very simple reason: the constitutional militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. spanish-american war). the constitution provided that the militia could only be employed by the federal government in very limited purposes. as far back as the war of 1812, militia units had refused to leave united states territory to attack the enemy. further, there was no constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the federal military and militiamen were particularly protected. in all wars until ww-i every american who left the country under arms was a volunteer. when the national guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the army, existing soldiers were "grandfathered". at least one of these "grandfathered" individuals refused to go to france in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the federal courts. mr. rutledge has stated that the second amendment applies only to members of a "well organized" militia. however, the pre-constitutional history of the american militia shows relatively few periods when the militia came close to meeting either messrs. rutledge or hamilton's definition of "well organized". in the period of peace between the french & indian war and the revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to the revolution. perhaps mr. rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. i would not be so bold. again, i wish to repeat. the national guard, for all its merits, is not the militia described by the constitution nor by mr. hamilton nor by mr. henry nor by mr. coxe. the fact that the federal government and many states are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their constitutional militias diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the militia as detailed in the constitution. misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the constitution. the constitution prohibits states from keeping "troops or ships of war in time of peace". i have heard some insist this prevents states from maintaining a militia, but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. today we call any large vessel a "ship" but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel. a "ship" is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. a "brig" has two masts. in the contemporary usage the states were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the states' keeping nuclear missiles. "troops" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. in at least one respect, i am in agreement with mr. rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of the militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society, i am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a drill of their state's militia. -- donald r. newcomb * university of southern mississippi dnewcomb@whale.st.usm.edu * this is the way we tax and spend, tax dnewcomb@falcon.st.usm.edu * and spend. we're democrats in office.

here is a press release from the white house. president clinton's remarks on waco with q/a to: national desk contact: white house office of the press secretary, 202-456-2100 washington, april 20 -- following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press: 1:36 p.m. edt the president: on february the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued. the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life. the bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, david koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane. he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency. he was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february. given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi, designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. i was informed of the plan to end the siege. i discussed it with attorney general reno. i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask. i then told her to do what she thought was right, and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. mr. koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive. he killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. now we must review the past with an eye towards the future. i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently. i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review. finally, i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people. i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general, to the justice department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. again, i want to say as i did yesterday, i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco. i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks. and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. q mr. president, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided -- q mr. president, can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- the president: i can't hear you both. if one will go first and then the other. q sorry. can you describe what janet reno -- q mr. president -- the president: i'll answer both your questions, but i can't do it at once. q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? the president: yes. i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. and she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building. and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire. in fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. there were no shots coming back from the government side. i asked a number of questions. the first question i asked is, why now? we have waited seven weeks; why now? the reasons i was given were the following: number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. they might be needed in other parts of the country. number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out. number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time. and number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. so for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good. she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. the third question i asked was, has the military been consulted? as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco, that's the first thing i asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it. and so i asked if the military had been consulted. the attorney general said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. having asked those questions and gotten those answers, i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that i would support it. and i stand by that today. q mr. president -- the president: wait. go ahead. q can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? the president: no, i'm bewildered by it. the only reason i made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody. it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. there was -- i have -- i can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place. i talked to her yesterday. i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show, and i talked to her again this morning. a president -- it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. i will say this, however. i was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves. (applause.) i regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. they were heavily armed. they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on. we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life. they made the decision to immolate themselves. and i regret it terribly, and i feel awful about the children. but in the end, the last comment i had from janet reno, is when -- and i talked to her on sunday -- i said, now, i want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. and she said, it's because of the children. they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time. i have to take their word for that. so that is where i think things stand. q can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience? and if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way? the president: no -- well, i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today. this is a -- the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time. this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety-split, record time. we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way. is there something else we should have known? is there some other question they should have asked? is there some other question i should have asked? can i say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? i don't know that. that's why i want the inquiry and that's why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. there is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. and we may have to confront it again. and i want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved. but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. q mr. president, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday? the president: well, yes, i got regular reports all along the way. there were lots of other options pursued. if you go back -- you all covered it very well. the fbi -- you did a very good job of it. i mean, the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working. some of the children got out, some of the other people left. there was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities. and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. that's what they thought. q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? the president: that's up to the congress. they can do whatever they want. but i think it's very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts. and as i said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate. there is nothing to hide here. this was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.

here is a press release from the white house. president clinton's remarks on waco with q/a to: national desk contact: white house office of the press secretary, 202-456-2100 washington, april 20 /u.s. newswire/ -- following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press (part 2 of 2): go ahead, sarah. q there are two questions i want to ask you. the first is, i think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks. and on february 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? the president: they were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the treasury department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them. q what federal laws -- the president: let me go back and answer -- i can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. and one of the things that i've heard -- i don't want to get into the details of this because i don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. they also knew, sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent. and they were -- i think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. in terms of the gas masks themselves, i learned yesterday -- i did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work. so that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. ms. myers: last question. q mr. president, why are you still saying that -- q could you tell us whether or not you ever asked janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? and when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? the president: what i asked janet reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen. and she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway. and she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future. that was the judgment they made. whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. what happened when i saw the fire, when i saw the building burning? i was sick. i felt terrible. and my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. that's the first thing i wanted to know. thank you. q mr. president, why are you still saying it was a janet reno decision? isn't it, in the end, your decision? the president: well, what i'm saying is that i didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the fbi. i didn't go over every strategic part of it. it is a decision for which i take responsibility. i'm the president of the united states and i signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call. when i talked to her on sunday, some time had elapsed. she might have made a decision to change her mind. i said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, i will support you. and i do support her. she is not ultimately responsible to the american people; i am. but i think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as well as she could have. thank you.

today's atrocity in waco has finally impelled me to start working on something i've been thinking about for some time. over the last few years i have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok. unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector. so i intend to put together what i call the "american horror file": a compilation of cases where the american government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which i can find decent documentation. i hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government. the end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ascii text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years. this book will be distributed at cost, and i will encourage people to post copies to bbs's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors. this is a call for your help. any information that you can send me on how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated. i would prefer information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific instances of governmental abuses. i also welcome anyone who wants to join me in collecting and researching information for this project. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- kevin s. van horn | is your religion batf-approved? vanhorn@bert.cs.byu.edu |

cnn just reported the atf and the fbi have begun killing everyone in the united states. a press release stated this action was required because bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday do something illegal. an atf spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated that "this would clean up things once and for all". if the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the fbi has indicated they will "burn them, just like we did those kooks in waco". it hasn't been decided how the new proposed "energy tax" will enter into this, an irs representative stated "we're looking at the tax code to determine if taxes really end at death. with this many dead americans, we don't want to overlook anything". an atf agent ran into the room, and shot her. stay tuned....rich

oldham@ces.cwru.edu (daniel oldham) babbles: what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf. if they would of had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. 	if they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the 	warrant, like the sheriff had done 3 other times, they 	wouldn't have needed to have an initial assault. but then, 	herr klinton and attorney gen'l reno wouldn't have been 	able to have told such heroic stories about how they 	"protected" the rest of us from a group of people who 	kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie. the batf needs more people, better weapons and more armored transports. when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use more force instead of retreating to a stand off. if you are going to do a job then do it right. the batf is there to protect us and they must have the proper equipment and people to do the job. 	the batf needs to be disbanded. this out of control group 	of rambo wannabees is a danger to the republic. with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. 	well, i figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by 	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so i'll 	just let it pass for now. 	case western reserve, huh? do the feds know about that big 	stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in your 	house? are you the same daniel oldham that lives on orchard 	drive? just so they get the address right, that is... look at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country of ours. 	well, it used to be a great country. now i'm not so sure. 	i knew a few of those good people who died in wars; i was 	in viet nam. i can assure you, none of us fought to protect 	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with 	military force without provocation. (hint: serving a search warrant 	is not sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault 	on a religious group. at least not here in the us. maybe in 	iraq, or syria...) with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later. 	this is a joke, right? or are they really letting fools like 	you into cwru now? too bad. used to be a good school. how'd you 	get in anyway, did your old man buy a new wing for the library?

the following is quoted from the tail end of a (rather condescending) article about paxton quigley, that appeared in us snooze and world lies, (sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...) and was repeated in the colorado (people's) daily, a student newspaper at the university of colorado at boulder. "a study of residential gunsot deaths in king county, wash., found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder. studies by the western psychiatric institute, in pittsburgh, found that the mere presence of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness." i have seen these numbers quoted before, and i have seen very specific refutation of them quoted as well. if someone will be so kind as to email the relevant information, i will write a letter to the editor of the co. daily (which might get published) and send a copy to usn&wr as well. thanx... --dan -- dod #202 / loki@acca.nmsu.edu / liberty or death / taylordf@ucsu.colorado.edu send me something even you can't read... -----begin pgp public key block----- version: 2.1 mqcnaitfksqaaaeeakceejwi9f5kmjykp0logc5dghrpbmy2xhoo8kpehmdyuf8a 1bfdqsj53kostz6hroshsdzlvul1/40vpjmmntfr+vyz4jvd3rl4iuq2ummmex3m itf3ult8xn/v/qabsvhcfshvjvk4lf6wosucmo03m2tix31ai7vb0uzo4yxjaaux tcreyw5pzwwgribuyxlsb3igpexva2laywnjys5ubxn1lmvkdt4= =s5ib -----end pgp public key block-----

this was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. ============================================================== hi folks; wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial. opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last august. the prosecution argued that weaver and his family moved to idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the "evil" federal government. the prosecution alleges that weaver sold federal agents "sawed off" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: despite repeated "good faith" efforts to get weaver to surrender peacefully, weaver refused. the shootout erupted when weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing. according to the prosecution, three people were taking an "offensive action" against an fbi helicopter when an fbi sniper killed vicki weaver. the defense argued that weaver and his family moved to northern idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace. they wanted simply to be left alone. weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a "regular supplier"). the defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but i assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story. we'll know more as things develop]. the failure to appear in court happenned because weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. the shootout occurred when federal agent arthur roderick killed weaver's dog that was in proximity to weaver's son, samuel. weaver then fired in self-defense. in the ensuing battle, federal agent william degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: however, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained). finally, the defense claims that vicki weaver was only going to "look at the body" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an fbi sniper. prosecution quote: "weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation." -- asst. u.s. attorney kim lindquist defense quote: "the evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where randy weaver and kevin harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit." -- gerry spence [nice soundbite!] notes: the _idaho statesman_ claims that weaver supporters heeded a call from spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse. however, the local nbc affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including "tim" again. "tim" claimed he was a skinhead, who were "ordinary, working class people." he also claimed he was for "white pride, not white power." outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with bo gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear randy weaver. in an affiliated article carried in the _idaho statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse. these lawyers were present to watch gerry spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him. some tidbits: spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son kent were volunteering their time to represent weaver because they believed in him. spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and spence compared the "sawed off" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!). today (thursday, april 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence. drew ============================================================= -- ************************************************************** * ron phillips crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com * * senior customer engineer * * intergraph electronics * * 381 east evelyn avenue voice: (415) 691-6473 * * mountain view, ca 94041 fax: (415) 691-0350 * **************************************************************
this was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list. ============================================================= hi folks; thursday, april 15 marked day 3 of the trial. this day marked the first testimony of the trial. deputy u.s. marshal larry cooper took the stand for the prosecution. the short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution. cooper testified that he had arrived in spokane (washington) on august 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the weaver cabin. the team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people. the six later met at an observation point above the cabin. after this, deputies cooper, william degan, and arthur roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites. cooper told the court that roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, "whether the [weaver family] dogs would respond." striker, the weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly. roderick led the three in a run from the area. they ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the "fern field"] with the dog in pursuit. by this time, kevin harris and samuel weaver had joined the chase. the surveillance team had reached a y in the road: cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be "shot in the back." as degan reached the y, he spotted randy weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead. weaver was startled but did not fire. at this moment, striker reached degan, and cooper had to "fend him off with his gun." [it is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog]. both cooper and degan then took cover in the woods. according to cooper, kevin harris and samuel weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two. after they had passed by on the road, degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, "stop! u.s. marshal!" harris then "...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired. he didn't bring the weapon up to eye level. i saw bill's arm going back, and i knew he had been hit." cooper fired at harris, and harris went down. cooper then brought his weapon to bear on samuel, but did not fire. at this point, cooper then heard two shots to his right. samuel weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, "you son of a bitch!" and ran toward them. cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin. at this point he then saw samuel weaver running toward the cabin. when cooper reached degan, he placed his first two fingers on degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped. shortly thereafter, roderick and the other three marshals joined him. they then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin. on cross-examination, david nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, "you wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?" nevin also pointed out that in last september's testimony, cooper had claimed that he spotted weaver after the dog had left him. cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that thursday's account was correct. nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available]. friday, april 16 marks continued cross-examination of cooper. notes: there was no coverage of protestors. drew ============================================================== -- ************************************************************** * ron phillips crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com * * senior customer engineer * * intergraph electronics * * 381 east evelyn avenue voice: (415) 691-6473 * * mountain view, ca 94041 fax: (415) 691-0350 * **************************************************************

in the videos of the original batf attack on the bd church, did anyone happen to see batf agents on the highest structure, where koresh's room was? i don't recall seeing batf agents higher than the roof of the lowest structures, so i made an assumption that batf helos did the firing down into the tower. any other info on how the rounds came through the roof?

"coincidence? i think not!" and as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of destruction. the fbi tried to convince the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the building. sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to cover its ass. : and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader? how is he : on diabolical laughter? does he look good in a cape? these things must be : investigated. you first. oh, please. if you want to argue, argue. if you merely want to demean those who see this differently than you, then please go somewhere else. : mark sachs is: mbs110@psuvm.psu.edu keith marchington

the branch davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence. when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back. but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for their wounded. the bd even released the atf agents they captured. it is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical attention that the bd were not looking for trouble. if the bd were violent they would have held the atf agents as hostages. they would not have released them like they did. if they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc. a big thing is being made of the bd collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them. it is also apparent that the bd did not have any military training. if they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications. they could have shot out the lights and speakers. it appears that the bd were not violent, they shot back at the attacking atf agents out of panic. there were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the fbi attack on the compound with armor. all the violence in waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the bd. -- rod anderson n0nzo | the only acceptable substitute boulder, co | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | -solomon short- satellite n0nzo on ao-16 |
flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires. a fire will start small and in one location and heat the air. the temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once. this may have occurred in the bd compound, i have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound. when the fire got big enough, and broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire. because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape. they were trapped by the flames in their safe room. i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final assault. i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the fbi overcoming the "forces of evil", aka the branch davidians. the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove that they were not using excessive force. -- rod anderson n0nzo | the only acceptable substitute boulder, co | for brains is silence. rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | -solomon short- satellite n0nzo on ao-16 |

here's something preston covey (professor of ethics at cmu) wrote: from: "preston k. covey" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> subject: gun stats & mortal risks date: mon, 15 feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (est) folks, hail from the nether world. on february 4th, the wall street journal carried a front-page article by erik larson entitled "armed force." i felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that "a gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect." i sent the following to the wsj. ----- gun stats & mortal risks preston k. covey 	erik larson~s even-handed article on paxton quigley (~armed force,~ 2/4/93, wsj) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home: ~a pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in king county, washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~ the ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days; it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~ given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 new england journal of medicine (nejm) study is remarkably understated: ~the advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 	responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home. but what we need to know is this: what exactly are the risks and benefits? the nejm testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks. further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know: what control do we have over the risks and benefits? and, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents: how can we minimize the risks? like raw highway death tolls, the nejm stat is not very helpful here. 	the nejm finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off. it is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify. the frightful statistic screams for itself: the risks far outweigh the benefits, yes? what fool would run these risks? if your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination, should you not take the bus? 	uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies. surely, we can do better where lives are at stake. let~s take a closer look at this risky business: 	the ~43 times~ stat of the nejm study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home (the dividend). the divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense. the dividend is 387: in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides. 387 divided by 9 yields 43. there were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in king county between 1978 and 1983, so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted. 	the nejm~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts: 	1. the dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media: the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~ the implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children. deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk. these crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors. this is criminological hogwash. 	2. the study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed. in actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure. to ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk. 	3. one misleading implication of the way the nejm stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility. the typical quotation of this study (unlike larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun: ~a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~ (the center to prevent handgun violence, a major promulgator of the nejm statistic, uses this particular formulation.) we can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing: again, by tautology, gun deaths would not occur without the guns. the question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns. in any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments. the moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice. due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise). the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejm~s high-risk pool. the gun does not create this risk by itself. people have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes. for example, graduates of paxton quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers. undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death. this is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities. fortunately, nothing can consign us to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter. 	4. suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the nejm study. as against the total deaths by gun in king county, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies. suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents. the implication of the nejm study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns. it is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed. it is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides. this is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases. (see: bruce l. danto et al., the human side of homicide, columbia university press, 1982; charles rich et al., ~guns and suicide,~ american journal of psychiatry, march 1990.) if suicides were removed from the dividend of the nejm study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~ the inclusion of suicides in the nejm risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter. quotations of the nejm study totally disregard this issue. 	5. citations of the nejm study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide. most measures, like the nejm homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. but many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense. in the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. time~s january 18, 1993, cover story on women ~fighting back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out. time~s july 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense. in a may 14, 1990, update, time reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. in time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four. the possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the nejm statistic. 	6. while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading. the divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed, not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at. the utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes. what kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ? do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred? should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses? the question posed to media that cite the nejm scare stat is this: why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist gary kleck (point blank: guns and violence in america , aldine de gruyter, 1992)? 	kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies: the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist). dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33. thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody. 	of course, kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control. we should indeed question the basis and method of kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as i have questioned the nejm statistic. clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics. one thing troubles me still: we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in our media, but we hardly ever find kleck~s good work mentioned, even critically. -- larry cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but i'm personally waiting to see what the texas rangers have to say about it all before i pass judgment. why don't you do the same. some more interesting facts about the waco incident: 1) the original assault was conducted by batf officers wearing an assorted types of camouflage. i saw, on cnn, at least three different types. i would be hard pressed to identify a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to be police. 2) the batf has been lying from the beginning: + "we only had handguns" - the original footage showed 4 batf officers on a roof top getting shot at, one had an mp-5 assault sub-machine gun. + "we were out gunned" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the best in quarters weapon, you can't be out gunned when you have the best guns available for the job. + "we didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!" - this one is the best, there are very few guns that won't shoot through a household door, or through a house wall for that matter. since officers from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and *firearms* should know that, they are either lying or incredibly incompetent. not to mention criminally negligent if they are shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter plywood. + "we had a search warrant. actually, we had an arrest warrant. no, wait, we had both. yeah, that's the ticket. oh, and they're child molesters too. and they make *drugs*. did we mention we think they have rocket launchers." - the story from batf and fbi spokespeople has changed daily and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous. 3) throughout the siege the fbi and batf have be claiming that one of their biggest concerns was that koresh and his followers would mass suicide. now they are claiming that that's what he did and that they are surprised that he did. huh? all in all i think that anything the fbi and batf say should be taken with a grain or two of salt. rob. -- robert a. osborne ...!uunet.ca!isgtec!robert or robert@isgtec.com

|question #2 |as i understand it, in evanston, il, they have a ordinance banning handguns. |is there any way to get around this provision? why don't you call the city and ask? oak park also has an illegal handgun ban as well, but does allow those with a "collectors ffl" to possess ("collectible?") handguns. |what would the penalty if you were found out be? probably a fine in practical terms. |what if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment |there? how would the city law apply to your impending |trial for the shooting? it wouldn't impede your defense at all. there was an actual incident in oak park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. on the other hand, a black man used an illegally owned handgun in oak park to defend himself, and the village tried to make an example out of him. an nra director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided not to charge the guy. of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it's own drawbacks, like when the oak park police chief came to his house, and told him: "this is stepping over the line; this could get dangerous for you." whereupon the few black oak park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family. |also, what is il state law concerning short barreled weapons? short barreled |shotgun is what i would be interested in if a handgun were not available, |either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie colt, marlin). l.v. cipriani states that the "any other weapon" category is allowed, but the exact relationship between an ithaca auto-burgular, which i believe is in the "any other weapon" category and a chopped barrel h&k hk-94 (class 3 for sure) is not clear to me... |one more thing, what is the chance of getting a ccw permit in il without being |rich or famous or related to the mayor? in your dreams, buddy. as long as democrats reign in chicago, illinois residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. politicians get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry concealed weapons. voters in chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes out of office; because the dems are always in power, the illinois supreme court is always tilted to the democratic party's views on guns.

list, karl kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for rkba related information. this directory can be used for things like articles by kates, wright, tonso, levinson, supreme court decisions, the ria vs us decision, copies of legislation, and so on. it's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here. so, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here. instructions: short version for techies: the site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu. place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba. the ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work. give the command "type binary" to be sure files are transferred correctly. your files will be moved to the rkba directory. to get a file use the commands get or mget. i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived. long version for non-techies: in order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the internet. to connect to the archive site run the command: 	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu if that doesn't work you cannot use this archive. if the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login: 	name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc): instead of lvc your initials will appear. answer this prompt with: 	ftp next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address: 	guest login ok, send e-mail address as password: i would enter: 	l.v.cipriani@att.com you'll enter your own e-mail address. you'll get these lines or similar as output: 	remote system is unix. 	using binary mode to transfer files. next, the command prompt is printed: 	ftp> if you do not get the line "using binary mode to transfer files." run the command: 	type binary now you're logged in to the archive machine. there are many directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are 	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and 	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming there are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below. when you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon. to retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command: 	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or 	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba to submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command: 	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or 	cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command. to find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command: 	ls -l this will produce something like: total 6021 -r--r--r-- 1 karl 6932 jun 16 1992 dmn_gratia_ccp -r--r--r-- 1 karl 69149 apr 5 19:20 index -r--r--r-- 1 karl 18965 jun 16 1992 knox_aw_lies -r--r--r-- 1 karl 10930 apr 30 1992 s361 -r--r--r-- 1 karl 8958 jun 16 1992 wsj_crimestrike -r--r--r-- 1 karl 2649 jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r-- 1 karl 935 mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r-- 1 karl 36079 aug 4 1992 aclu ... and so on ... each line corresponds to one file. reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with. to get a file run the command "get" followed by the name of the file you want, for example: 	get index or 	get noduty after the file is transfered to your machine a message like this: 	transfer complete. 	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 kbytes/s) you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. you can use the mget command to retreive multiple files. if the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/hr1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it: 	cd congress/103rd 	get hr1025 once you're finished you can log off with the command: 	quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different. first of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry. the index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory. for example: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- file: whitemanslaw white man's law by william r. tonso, from the december 1985 reason magazine ---------------------------------------------------------------------- once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above). once you are in the incoming directory use the command: 	put file_name in this case: 	put whitemanslaw again there'll be a "transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds" message. now your file is on the archive machine. another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/. be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write. if you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message]. your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory. once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file. if you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i'll take care of the rest. if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first. if you have any questions feel free to ask me.

on the subject of cs/cn/tear gas: when i received my initial introduction to tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit. if there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or any other obstacles to movement, i would have had a difficult time exiting the chamber. and any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas contaminated area is considered a real bad idea. so hoping the bd's would peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic. if they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't be too far fetched. throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off. anybody tried to get amnesty international to jump in on this one? -- ******************************************************************************** james s. cochrane * when in danger, or in doubt, run in * this space gt6511a@prism.gatech.edu * circles, scream and shout. * for rent ********************************************************************************

(flames to /dev/null) --------- begin enclosed article ----------- 			the unabridged second amendment 			 by j. neil schulman if you wanted to know all about the big bang, you'd ring up carl sagan, right ? and if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf, no question about it. but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage, to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution ? that was the question i asked a.c. brocki, editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system. mr. brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud, a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of "american usage and style: the consensus." a little research lent support to brocki's opinion of professor copperud's expertise. roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at usc. since 1952, copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for "editor and publisher", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field. he's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary, and merriam webster's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert. copperud's fifth book on usage, "american usage and style: the consensus," has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the association of american publisher's humanities award. that sounds like an expert to me. after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested, i sent the following letter: "i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage, to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution, and extract the intent from the text. "the text of the second amendment is, 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.' "the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.' "i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent. further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment, i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary." my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment, then concluded: "i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter. i am doing so because, as a citizen, i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment. while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, i ask that you do this because of that importance." after several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, professor copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity): [copperud:] "the words 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause. it is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall'). the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia. "in reply to your numbered questions: [schulman:] "(1) can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?" [copperud:] "(1) the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people." [schulman:] "(2) is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the second amendment, or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?" [copperud:] "(2) the right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed. the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia." [schulman:] "(3) is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free state, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?" [copperud:] "(3) no such condition is expressed or implied. the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia. no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state. the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence." [schulman:] "(4) does the clause 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?" [copperud:] "(4) the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated. it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia." [schulman:] "(5) which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?" [copperud:] "(5) the phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military." [schulman:] "(6) (if at all possible, i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated." [copperud:] "to the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment. if it were written today, it might be put: "since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.' [schulman:] "as a 'scientific control' on this analysis, i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence, "a well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and read books, shall not be infringed.' "my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be, "(1) is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the second amendment's sentence?; and "(2) could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?" [copperud:] "(1) your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure. "(2) there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation." professor copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: "with well-known human curiosity, i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion." so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along: the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right. as i write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. and here in the united states, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely. american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the constitution. and even the american civil liberties union (aclu), staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights, stands by and does nothing. it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right. no one else will. no one else can. will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do? will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak ? or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the constitution of the united states promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

|question: |what will californians do with all those guns after the reginald |denny trial? the wall street journal had an article on how the police were whining about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are employees of the government. rather like having your janitor complain about job conditions. i say californians should form armed block clubs that would engage in coordinated strategies should batf attempt to disarm them based on the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. unlike waco, californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down with abandoned car blockades. m-1 garands should easily outclass batf shock troops with their h&k mp-5 smgs, and there should be enough sony walkmans and boom boxes to overwhelm any fbi psy-war operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. billary clinton would get what he wanted, a war on gunowners, the batf would attempt to show the anti-gun press they they really, really were in charge with a 500-man "charge of the light brigade," and the fbi would attempt to show how _they_ really were in charge by asking the californian national guard to level the area with artillary! :-) :-) :-)

it must be symbolic in nature. the police are essentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community". if you, i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous. >> >> >>i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or >> >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are >> >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often >> >>"borrowed" from a parent without their knowledge. >> > >> >i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - i >> >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of >> >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun) >> >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students >> >who carry a gun to school daily. >> > >> well joe, i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence >> or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see >> that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. >> the cphv reports that 135,000 youth bring guns to school daily and that >> 400,000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates >> that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once >> in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key >> children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access >> to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200% increase in >> student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between >> 1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in >> schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88. these are the "statistics". >> > >200% increase in california schools, eh?

folks, it's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local tv, radio and newprint media. ideally, these questions could be asked at any investigation into the batf's and fbi's participation at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the batf and fbi. my list is up to 13 that are really nagging at my gut. the list will probably grow. 1. what were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that the batf obtained? 2. it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet. therefore, a "no-knock" raid could be ruled out. prior to the initial assault on the complex, did a single batf agent and accompanying witness (without a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law? 3. on the day of the initial assault on the complex, batf agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings. in the ensueing gun battle, batf agents fired into a building known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child. knowing children were present, why didn't the batf have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 4. the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over $200,000 in firearms and ammunition. did david koresh and the members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms license, were they actively participating in the legal business of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed? does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons. 5. after the original assault on the compound tragically failed, a batf spokeswoman stated "we were outgunned!". yet, tv newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents armed with mp-5 and ar-15/m16 rifles. although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's bodies, they also may have had ak-47 and sks rifles. what type(s) of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex? 6. since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily, why did the fbi treat it as a "hostage" situation? 7. along the same lines, why did the fbi use "psychological warfare" techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind? 8. reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers. since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out, why did the fbi expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities? 9. agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch davidians setting fire to the complex. branch davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table. video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location. was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated? 10. fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide. yet, bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex. this seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history. what evidence does the fbi have that a mass suicide pact existed? 11. fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the branch davidian's ammunition and/or powder cache exploding. yet, the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes. was any evidence found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball? if so, and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business? 12. it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound. is there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act? 13. fbi director sessions states that, during the final assault on the complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles." on the video tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines. yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired. also, there are no indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows, buildings or other structures in the video. surely, these should be evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles. finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles. do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high-power rifles? 14. cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent. the united states has signed international treaties which prevent the use of cs gas in warfare. if the united states could not morally use cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops, why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land? 15. on april 21, fbi spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide. on april 22, the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head. were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

having read the posted long article by jpfo, i have some observations: 1. this article does not claim that the gca of 1968 is a "verbatim translation" of a nazi law. what it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section. the implication is that the similarities are devastating. in the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce the german text of the nazi law, together with its translation. not surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea: that the american gca is a literal translation of the nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, urban-folklore style. 2. the article goes to great pains to establish that senator dodd had a copy of the nazi law, either from his time on the nurnberg prosecution team or later. this fact is considered highly incriminating, but i don't understand why. the author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly: "if dodd got his copy of the original german text of the nazi weapons law during his time at nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the reichsgesetzblatt [the german law registry]." bingo. exactly. dodd had a *book*, with a series of nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion. all of the stuff about "why would a u.s. congressman have a copy of a nazi law?" melts away, by the author's admission. he then continues: "but if he acquired the original german text of the nazi weapons law after his service at nurnberg, he must have done so for a very specific reason..." but there's absolutely no reason to think that this is the case. in fact, as a "senior member of the u.s. team that helped to prosecute nazi war criminals", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy. all arguments about whether the nazi weapon law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether dodd personally prosecuted the interior minister who signed it, can be put aside as red herrings. 3. having established that dodd owned a copy of the original german text, the jpfo article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated. the problem is, in the context of the charge levelled at dodd, these two things work *against* each other. people ask to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*. if dodd took it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into american law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, wouldn't he? anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that i questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly. why would dodd need the exact translation for this purpose? is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet? didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own? once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: "dodd may have offered his copy of the nazi weapons law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the nazi law." in fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the congressional record, under the heading of documents "concerning the history of nazism and gun confiscation", dodd's motivation isn't a mystery: he asked for the translation in order to put it in the cr. 4. even this article makes it clear that the part of the nazi law that was added *by* the nazi regime is only a small part of that law. registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus not a "nazi-inspired" idea. the parts of the nazi law that parallel the 1968 gca include handgun control of some sort, and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons. the jpfo then goes on to list other parts of the nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the american gca. nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the discussion of the anti-jewish parts of the law, the jpfo article continues, "given the parallels between the nazi weapons law and the gca'68..." -- so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law. -- 					-- don porges 					porges@inmet.camb.inmet.com 					..uunet!inmet!porges

the u.s. government's campaign of persecution and genocide against the branch davidians was a resounding success. heil clinton! heil reno! the gestapo is alive and well and living in washington, d.c. -- kevin, who agrees that david koresh was probably a first-rate nutcase but who firmly believes that the bill of rights guaranteed his his right to be a religious fanatic and that the government is guilty of violating his civil rights and of 1st degree murder. ok, which small, under-represented-in-congress religious group are we going to persecute next and are we going to torch their church with a rolled up copy of the constitution? i think i'm going to be sick now. . .

hello, i just want to make 2 points: 1) the fbi is not stupid. these people are chosen for their intelligence, education, loyalty to the government, etc. they are given much intensive training. so, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here, and say that the fbi was just stupid, i say i don't believe it. 2) the fbi has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. the fbi can manufacture evidence. need a tape of koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of computer graphics, you can have one. the thing is, manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time. so it may be a few more days before we get to see them. or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any fbi video is because it is: 	1) classified 	2) too gruesome for our eyes 	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it dwayne jacques fontenot btw, i get my information from live video feeds. i read the papers too, but almost everything in them contradicts what i have seen with my own eyes.

according to wnci 97.9 fm radio this morning, dayton, ohio is operating a gun "buy back". they are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in. they ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of some sort. they are looking for more funds to keep operating. another media-event brought to you by hci. is there something similar pro-gun people can do ? for example, pay $100 to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ? sounds a bit tacky, but hey, whatever works. -- larry cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

(japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the u.s. there people jump off buildings.) according to the national crime survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by "non-strangers," which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the king county study to mean, "friends and family." that is, mr. quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a "friend, family member, or child," equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger. unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa. most rapes are commited by someone known to the victim, for instance. essentially, that a gun was used against a "friend" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person. crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most "at risk" for family problems, especially violent ones. a son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might. finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm. using the minimum figures i worked out using the ncs i got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. between the fbi uniform crime report and the ncs there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. as such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the ncs (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed. not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a "friend or family member" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home. (i believe a large number occur in businesses.) >studies by the >western psychiatric institute, in pittsburgh, found that the mere presence >of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member >will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness." i have not seen the exact data for this, so i can't comment. i will point out canada's and japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates. there was also a comparative study between canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the new england journal of medicine (i can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group pa146008@utkvm1.utk.edu - "i still remember the way you laughed, the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore." - "weird al"

look, folks, i don't know what happened in waco. i do not claim the bds are angels, i never did. koresh may very well be the devil incarnate. i just don't know. but i do know that i must question any single source of information, such as we have here. and i must question even harder given that it is single source at the insistance of that very government. what ever else happened at waco, that is perhaps the biggest evil done. and even more so in light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the state officials. but what i really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong. they are fanatic to the point of making things up, such as brent's microwave oven disclaim of the bd's using fire for food heating. i am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power koresh held over the bds, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those rapid apologists. jim -- jmd@handheld.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "i'm always rethinking that. there's never been a day when i haven't rethought that. but i can't do that by myself." bill clinton 6 april 93 "if i were an american, as i am an englishman, while a foreign troop was landed in my country, i never would lay down my arms,-never--never--never!" william pitt, earl of chatham 1708-1778 18 nov. 1777

the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal's article on paxton quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the journal tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t.p.g. type folks, i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it. the text follows. the colorado daily, btw, is the university of colorado (boulder) student (i think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (the title was the only thing they changed/added) "gun stats" the daily recently reprinted an article from the wall street journal, primarily concerned with paxton quigley, author of "armed and female." the article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the new england journal of medicine. the article states, "a study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." this is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: the study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you. the study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. the study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'. this would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check. possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. the nejm study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense. especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. statistics available from the fbi and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. d.f. taylor cu department of chemistry and biochemistry -- spooksmoke: revolution, assasination, thorium, cobalt-60, clintin, cia, nsa, shc dod #202 / loki@acca.nmsu.edu / liberty or death / taylordf@ucsu.colorado.edu send me something even you can't read... -----begin pgp public key block----- version: 2.2 mqcnaitfksqaaaeeakceejwi9f5kmjykp0logc5dghrpbmy2xhoo8kpehmdyuf8a 1bfdqsj53kostz6hroshsdzlvul1/40vpjmmntfr+vyz4jvd3rl4iuq2ummmex3m itf3ult8xn/v/qabsvhcfshvjvk4lf6wosucmo03m2tix31ai7vb0uzo4yxjaaux tcreyw5pzwwgribuyxlsb3igpexva2laywnjys5ubxn1lmvkdt4= =s5ib -----end pgp public key block-----

well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the compound has been answered. abc aired a report including the 911 tapes from monday. the fbi called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. by the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers and no water supply. the fbi made another call requesting a tank truck, but the waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one. though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference. they even aired a tape of a woman who called waco 911 from georgia asking if anything was being done. civic-minded, but probably irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local calls could get through. abc also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast. neither of these is conclusive proof that the koresh crowd offed themselves more than the fbi offed them, but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net. score 2 fbi, 0 branch davidians. or is that -89 branch davidians? -- | the koresh cult standoff is over ... may his victims recquiescat in pace | | | | (the above is a net.moment of silence) | daniel a. hartung -- dhartung@chinet.chinet.com -- ask me about rotaract

jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu: firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area. it would not be economic to smuggle them in. all production would have to be local. there are not all that many people who have both the skill and motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch. high-ranking crime figures could obtain imported uzis and such, but the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it. good point you make. however, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun. recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the allies during world war ii for use by partisans. they were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet. but they were useful as a means of killing german soldiers for their guns. also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. the point's been made here that one could make a sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder. i still think that while the point is good, i think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff. if guns are banned, i think the demand for "real" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot. in any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and "bad guys" will continue to have access to them, one way or another. and i don't see that as a necessary situation. -- allan j. heim allanh@sco.com ...!uunet!sco!allanh +1 408 427 7813

hi, in canada, any gun that enters a national park must be sealed (i think it's a small metal tag that's placed over the trigger). the net result of this is that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the national parks. instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions. i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer to nature, that they are a part of nature and, as such, have to deal with nature on it's own terms. guy

today rush was criticizing clinton for not claiming responsibility for the actions and decisions of janet reno and the fbi early enough to suit rush. about 2 months ago rush was chortling over the fact that reagan has stumped "special persecutor walsh" with his croaking of "i don't remember" when asked about ollie north. if rush's criticism of clinton were to be applied to reagan and north... reagan would have been impeached while north was convicted (and overturned on a technicality). gosh, rush sure wants to have it both ways... clinton must be held responsible, but reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense". maybe that's waht clinton should say about campaign promises and such "well, there you go again rush... but to tell the truth, i wasn't in the loop and i just don't remember."
boston globe, wednesday april 21 1993 col. 4 "bodies found in ruins as fbi defends raid on cult ranch" col. 5 "clinton blames koresh, orders probe of siege" col. 2 "the children: panws in a horrifying game" pg. 18, col. 1, editorial page 	"judgment at waco" 	now the scientific and political scrutiny of the horror show in waco begins, though nothing can undo the tragedy that might have been prevented there. 	forensic experts will study the rubble and ashes of the branch davidian compound, where at least 85 people, including 24 children, perished in smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of a manipulative madman and a stunning lapse in judgment by federal law enforcement officials. [emphasis added by me] 	investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno. that is their strong suit. 	but the public must question why agents of the federal bureau of investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. 	the loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader david koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness. his assembly of davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them. little in the way of rationality could be expected from koresh, a self- confsesed "sinner without equal." 	what continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents, who bungled the case from the start. the misadventure began on feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal bureau of alcohol, to- bacco and firearms storemd the compound, intent on seizing koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons. four agents and an estimated six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle. earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. 	authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last. fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. 	it had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside "rancho apocalypse" were essentially hostages. with their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient. the government's superior firepower, control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. 	neither attorney general janet reno nor the fbi has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. 	if intelligence was accurate and koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an m-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind. if re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr. etc etc tec.... [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted] but some of the responsibility rests with clinton, and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on waco. 	if reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. 	full investigations into th ewaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches. the first step is to verify how the blaze started. though apportioning blame will play a role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time.

"i wish to turn state's evidence." hope deal's good. b) wait, figuring other federal agents will get bored and go on vacation. c) wait. if they come after you there will be a chance to kill more g-men. the fbi has you surrounded, asks you to come out immediately. a) come out, figuring long prison term is chance to catch up on some writing. b) stall. you just can't concentrate when you're on trial for some reason. c) decide to write novel-length prophecy now while ideas are fresh in mind. fbi calls and says they will use tear gas if you don't come out. a) come out with hands up. your radical bro-in-law hated getting gassed at uc. b) get out your gas mask. really, these feds will have to give up eventually. c) shoot at vehicles delivering tear gas. it's rude to break down a man's door! fbi calls and says they will use tanks to break down your walls. a) come out with your hands up. flimsy cardboard construction won't last long. b) with presence of mind, move flammable devices away from tinder-dry haybales. c) spread some kerosene around and hit a match. big schwarzenegger ending. points are awarded in the following manner: 0 points for every (a) answer, -1 points for every (b) answer, and -2 points for every (c) answer. count 'em up and compare with your friends! if you answered (a) all the time, you are probably in jail, but alive. if you answered (b) all the time, you may still be holed up in your compound. if you answered (c) all the time, you are probably dead.

ok... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion. you see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door. will you a) defend yourself and family against this attack b) realize "oh, only the batf would enter like that, so i better surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do what they would like? you have chosen a), and discover that the people you defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender. you have learned that they intend to charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time. then they start using psychological warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial. some weeks into this standoff, you are still holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks. yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time. while you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks. only 9 of your followers make it. i am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate. i am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant. look at how the texas rangers view the batf. look at the fbi statements regarding the batf actions. from all apparent sources, the fbi blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the batf, resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the bd's who were still in the compound, and are now playing cya. the batf committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of texas ng resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses by accusing the bd's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault. -- ******************************************************************************** james s. cochrane * when in danger, or in doubt, run in * this space gt6511a@prism.gatech.edu * circles, scream and shout. * for rent ********************************************************************************

i'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against the davidians by the fbi/batf. here is what i've got so far. care to add any or provide more backup info? first amendment: 1) fbi/batf violated davidians right to free exercise of religion from the 	start. we now have a de facto precident against any minority religion. 2) fbi/batf violated bd right to free speach by: 	a> preventing them to speak to media 	b> preventing them from practicing their beliefs 3) fbi/batf violated the freedom of the press by: 	a> keeping them 2 miles from the davidians 	b> preventing the media to cover the fbi/batf actions close-up 	c> censoring media reports 4) fbi/batf violated the bd's right to peaceable assemble 	a> proven by initial baseless assault second amendment: 1) the batf went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the 	fbi/batf didn't approve of. 'nuff said. fourth amendment: 1) the right of the bd's to be "secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures" was violated by: 	a> initial baseless assault fifth amendment: 1) the davidians were "held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime" without a "presentment or indictment by a grand jury." 2) the davidians were "deprived of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. sixth amendment: 1) the accused were denied the right to "a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury" when the fbi became judge, jury and executioner. 2) the bd's were never informed of the specific "nature anad cause of the accusation." eighth amendment: 1) the davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when: 	a> the fbi cut off the water to the ranch 	b> the fbi used psy-war (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of 	 dying rabbits and tibetian chants) 	c> the fbi prevented family members from contacting their family 	 inside the ranch. 	d> the fbi used tear-gas against them (especially the children) 	e> the fbi burned the ranch down. 	f> thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing. anything i miss? --pv

the best reason to abolishing the atf is that they don't have enough to do. if the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to the fbi (firearms) and irs (tobacco and alcohol). both of these organizations have enough to do. the fbi is probably not going to try to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken gun. there have been postings stating that law enforcement should be divided and and weak. but there is nothing more dangerous to liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to chase. the atf is one and look at the trouble it started in waco. -- rod anderson n0nzo | "i do not think the united states government boulder, co | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | fanatics decided to kill themselves" satellite n0nzo on ao-16 | slick willie the compassionate

for those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to another in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the followup-to line. i didn't notice that. apologies to those who were confused. the substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages. however, i don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. suffice it to say that i disagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the second amendment offered by gun lovers, and what i think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated federalist papers. my webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control, and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. i think the latter a special interest pleading. no one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and not under control/disciplined, etc. thus i continue to believe the second amendment is a militia clause and not an 'arming everyone' clause. others are welcome to disagree (as i know many do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular forum. to avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, i note that i've come in here to post this one message, just to clarify the one below. i'm now outta here again though i'm available via e-mail. david in article <strnlghtc5tr6d.n3n@netcom.com> strnlght@netcom.com (david sternlight) writes: > >though i agree this is not the place to discuss guns, i note in passing that >a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words "well regulated" >in their distorted interpretations of the second amendment. > >david >-- >david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of > our information, errors and omissions excepted. > > -- david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information, errors and omissions excepted.
a really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today. it claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the u.s. i understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before may 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states. is texas one of those states? can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been killed by legal full-auto weapons in the u.s.? and finally, i think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest of facts on the waco incident. in particular, i would like a source for the fbi/batf mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and information on the beginning of the raid, specifically batf lies. i am also interested in past batf no-knock warrents which have lead to personal and property damage against innocent citizens. i intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon. the author of the piece states he wants to work for the batf. gack! -thomas

just saw a new commercial(?) by the nra. it starts out with a bunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime. they finally realize that they need to put criminals away longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun law.( during this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how easy criminals get off ) in the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal) watching him on tv just laughing his ass off. classic. sean

(though in some cases the i can see where that might not bother me all that much!) if you do drop him! remain where you are! have a bystander or witness(or create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police, and wait! reholster your weapon visibly! or place it on the ground nearby. do not attempt to recollect your brass.the police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. mentally mark witnesses! if the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can i phrase this?) try to avoid special purpose ammunition. hollow points and hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! the only special purpose rounds that i can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the glaser safety slug (oh what a lovely name safety slug) the stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not ricochette, and which is designed to stop (not kill (gee, to bad the two often cross, damn i'm real sorry that rapist is dead! not!) an assailant with one shot. this, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court. be as cooperative with the police as possible! show them where you were. repeat your information as often as requested. they will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see if your lying. fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (booo! down with registered citizens!register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) if they are required in your state. contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. if you cannot afford one, contact the nra. they have a legal assistance fund.(or at least they used to) i do hope your a member!

those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have wondered, "if it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?" the answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the chemical weapons treaty. the u.s. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including nnocent children. for confirmation see friday's clinton:am press briefing by george stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations.

"the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." 	- t. jefferson. i think what jefferson said is still true. >and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes >off into the wrong fleshy target. not very often compared to other use.[3] >or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows away his wife. this isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses. it is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly "get-pissed" and kill someone, gun or not. in most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence. if you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it. >having a thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to >kill things. right? right, but there are times when killing things is called for. i hope i never have to shoot a person, but i've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when i do, i don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary. i prefer they die instantly, but failing that, i want them to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, i don't want them to go fast or far. i try to choose the best weapon and ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal i'm after, but it doesn't always work as i plan. without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

ok, here goes. yes folks, i realize i have stuck my foot in my mouth quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications. my inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge. thanks to you kind (and some not so kind) people i am learning. some people have given me several good points to ponder and i see how i was wrong. in no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti-gun cause. i have said several times before (but nobody seemed to be listening) that i am pro-gun and anti-gun-control. as far as the race can of worms that i have opened up i have only one thing to say - i am in no way prejudiced. some of the things i have stated were said to demonstrate that i am not prejudiced and/or a racist but i have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced. i will not say anymore about that subject because no matter what i say it will be the wrong thing. boy, what a start to being on a new group. oh well, things have been worse in my life. i hope this clears things up but i guess that will remain to be seen. by for now, jason

posted for l. neil smith by cathy smith the lies of texas okay, what have we learned? for reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the first, second, fourth, fifth, ninth, and fourteenth amendments to the constitution. the man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own losses in the process. the agency responds by cutting off his electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside world. they are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more importantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations" any way they please. the impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time four l.a. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers using scoped, high-powered rifles. loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique, originated by north korean communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the warsaw ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected. the house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. at least 80 lives, including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the attorney general, and the president all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: blame the victim. he had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being "examined" by the agency that created them. he was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the jfk assassination. he set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. film at 11 -- in 3000 a.d. he shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that jim jones? best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty. a leading national paper claims 93% of the american people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted. but when did you ever know 93% of americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a soviet election than an opinion poll? very well, what can we infer from the above? for starters, never forget that, although democratic careers are on the line (and rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, it was planned and rehearsed by a republican administration. which may explain why paul harvey, who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time i did) about the war in viet nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the bill of rights. more importantly, when rush limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower of jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance as bill clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the system, then at least within yourself. on march 5, back at the beginning, mary gingell, national chair of the libertarian party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition. in fact, the lp has promised in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both agencies involved in waco. i'm proud to say i was there and helped to write that plank. true, the lp is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 1977 -- ask the democrats in georgia if you doubt it). but, alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and big lies, the lp is right about what happened in waco. and if their advice had been followed in 1977, waco never would have happened. think about it. and think about the fact that, if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the bill of rights, let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the lp less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote. think about it. l. neil smith author: the probability broach, the crystal empire, henry martyn, and (forthcoming) pallas editor: lever action bbs (303) 493-6674, fidonet: 1:306/31.4 libertarian second amendment caucus nra life member my opinions are, of course, my own.
no surrender! delivered by lenda jackson at the rkba rally in denver, april 18, 1993 it is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. a certain number of them actually are threatened. there are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. the noise downstairs at night. the lonely walk to the car. the stranger at the door. the abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. the burglar... the mugger...the rapist. and what are we told is the solution? move. get a dog. keep the door locked. call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? but what if you don't like dogs? like living alone? don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? what if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(kleck,124) than those using any other form of resistance (kleck,126) (also true for robbery/assault)(kleck,123) what if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. in truth, the supreme court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the whole community. as a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice themselves? are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? here's a thought. neil smith, in his book the probability broach, says "no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." but if a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified. "eughh, how could you? i'd be terrified!" they ask. how could you hurt someone? they'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. in truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122,kleck) well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already made that hard choice. we've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. we're buying more guns than every before. we're learning how to use them - and teaching others, women and men, how to use them. most importantly, we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. we're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. we're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and what we intend is to really take back the night. but there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist. that menace is government, and it threatens us all. we know that governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed people. it's the way they survive. in our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. it lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and threatens us with violence. no one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides "it's for your own safety" or "we know best". any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. but this monster called government persists, and grows. and we, who should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. do you doubt me? then why did you file your income tax? like any reasonable person, i believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. and make no mistake, they're after you and they're after me. their names are familiar: brady and reynolds, groff, metzenbahm, moynihan, and clinton. if we're lucky, they'll settle for our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. as citizens, we have only two choices. they are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight. surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of pol pot, to the disappearances, to dachau. i do not intend to surrender. a battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. but if they have to, they will keep in mind the words of thomas jefferson: "the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots." as a patriot, i will point out the error in the government's ways. i will do my best to vote the villains out of office. i will protest, and write, and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. and always remember that rebellion can lead to bunker hill and saratoga......or it can lead to tiananmen square. when the time comes to stand up, if i have to give my life to keep them from going too far, if there is a tiananmen square in our future, i intend to be there. and no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass, i intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick. my opinions are, of course, my own.

in the wake of the waco denouement, i had email discussions with people from this group. in particular, we discussed how cults operate, why the fbi might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations. i include an edited account of what i wrote. the identity of my correspondents have (i hope) been erased. the editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that. i've tried to retain the information content. ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed. a few of the comments in parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand. these notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize. cheers(?), oded ------------------------ (begin included text) ----------------------- i took a course called the madness of crowds, ... the course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed jonestown. (did some external reading too). william adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of "evil" mass movements... starting with the authoritarian personality, university of chicago press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii, and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ... i don't think the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced ..., but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume. so i think they're onto something. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		how cult psychology works... 	[i'm an amateur. hope i'm not hopelessly naive.] so long as koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them, away from him. otherwise, he'd (koresh) be nothing. during the siege, ex-davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls. absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ... as long as they believed him, they'd ignore batf/fbi/child protective services or even the red cross asking them to come out. after all, if they ever left him, god would catapult them straight to hell, and the combined forces of the us gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second. if i believed it, i'd stay and die too, like the folks in jonestown. for a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then themselves. that's the consequence of shattered "cultism." it really does happen all the time. [by the way, the treasured ideal in such cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.] ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [why no news, don't the feds owe the world an explanation?] i agree that official explanations are in order. i can also see good (?) reasons for news blackouts. >	the only fact available is that had the fbi not acted >	yesterday, those people would be alive today. ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted. he held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing would really stop him from offing them. even if the fbi went away! look at history. rep leo ryan (and some staffers) visited jonestown, at the request of constituents who had relatives there. once jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves, because jim jones knew he'd be busted. internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down. there are tapes... the "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by their own avowal would be dead within the hour. i suspect it's the same with the branch davidians. (there's a book on jonestown by james reston jr., titled our father who art in hell. i don't know whether it's good - never read it.) ... the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups, on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... so, the only way the batf/fbi could "save" those people, and future cults, is by ignoring such signs. i suppose there's another way - outsmarting koresh and tricking him into letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ... i suspect the fbi tried to do that with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults. however, maybe they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible. it's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk. ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	[why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after] ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the bd's from koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed. ... - if they were trying to wean the bd's from koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning boneheads from any point of view wouldn't screw it up. ... i _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at checkmate time people really die, and i could be blamed. ... i don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you deny the fbi, batf, child protective services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all. 		(the end) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 			 okay, have at it.

relay of coverage seen: ---------------------- there was a press conference by authorities at the compound on cnn earlier today (wednesday). it was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission. it was explained to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a texas ranger surveying the site. (!) the two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines. it was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. the press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case. that is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory. i bring this up because i haven't seen anyone else note it and i haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it. it will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. my opinions: ----------- i find this disturbing. while i believe that koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity, i find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize. since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me. it will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair. i have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall i have stated would be a good idea in previous months. please also note that i by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories i have read here and in other groups. as usual, i am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, imho. as such, my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available. scott roby standard disclaimer --

editorial - a10, saturday, april 24, 1993 crimestrike hits town with the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re- moving criminals from the streets the national rifle association's new crimestrike project, engineered by arizona's former chief assist- ant attorney general steven j. twist. crimestrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily crime. it is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally, including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that arizona is applying with its truth in sentencing law; funding construction and staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement. phoenix will be the home for this national organization. the gazette has vigorously opposed many nra policies on issues of gun control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek reasonable regulation of firearms. but crimestrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac- countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals. when an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and crime- strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars to getting criminals off the street. we say, welcome to town.

this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms-politics mailing list: i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation. (of course, this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion.) so, yesterday i went to hear him. what follows is a rough summary of what i think i heard him say, which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said... kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid. koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck. but so what? this isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has been ridiculed by the public. extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust. the first amendment applies, maybe especially, to people like koresh. lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us. there were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas. police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they called local armed citizens to help. many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns. the original intent was to have many small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard. when the fbi was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force). "all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power." the batf started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid illegal stills. when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills disappeared, and the batf needed something else to do to justify its existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. around the time when the batf's annual budget is under review, the media is alerted by the batf to come to such-and-such a place, where at a pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly. the media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless ffl in chains. the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf's budget was up for review. kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had some medical personnel on hand. he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh's arrest in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it. koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested. koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns back. at least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner. the batf didn't take into account that, unlike most of the ffl's they audit, koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his followers. thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and they reacted accordingly. with respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when kates was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that the batf has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant. he had more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been completely illegal. apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable, then it is ok to break in the door. but since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the batf breaking in the way they did. if the constitutional rights of the davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served warrant, then the davidians may have been justified in their actons. a close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was the first shot fired! the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse. after an initial position on the side of the batf, the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad, possibly illegal attack. a real cynic might say that the fbi went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides, and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the public's sympathy. should the batf be abolished? no. police agencies _should_ be numerous, diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc. better a few inept accidents like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized, well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have even more tragic results. - lyn bates (bates@bbn.com) ps don kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at boston college law school next tuesday, april 27. i don't know the exact time or place, but presumably a phone call to the bc law school could elicit that information. -- larry cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

"i have no question that our plan was correct?" months to get ready, unlimited funds, knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire, and no fire trucks on hand? this is "extreme professionalism and care?" i can understand the first screwed-up raid by the batf. they underestimated the opposition, which happens. but not this one. the fbi had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary. they still botched it. the fbi director and the fbi sac in overall charge should resign, or be fired for incompetence. i don't blame reno or clinton. they gave the fbi clear orders: don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that, wait it out. those were reasonable orders. the fbi said they could pull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't. 					john nagle

few simple points: leadership: you are responsible for all that your subordinates do or fail to do. law: any deaths that occur as a result or during the commision of a crime are a felony against whoever dies during the incident, and whoever committed the crime establishing the incident is chargable for murder one. this is how criminals are charged with murder for the deaths of bystanders from police stray rounds and such. someone dying of a heart attack is also considered a murder one, if it is in a situation caused by a crime. -- ******************************************************************************** james s. cochrane * when in danger, or in doubt, run in * this space gt6511a@prism.gatech.edu * circles, scream and shout. * for rent ********************************************************************************

their job is to protect the public and save lives not kill people for crying out loud. > it really was a no win situation. koresh had plenty of opportunity > to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officers. instead > he ordered the murder of the children. don't be so sure about that. i read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire. this cult member also said that david koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide. david koresh's lawyer also confirms this. therefore, if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered everyone in that house! even if this is not true, the fbi and atf still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the waco fire department. perhaps they wanted all these people to die. > in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive > the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the > suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given > the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met > by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh/gun supporter > claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the > aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier > grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. for all practical purposes > they were unarmed, the b-d followers had automatic weapons. you're wrong on several accounts. atf agents were adequately armed. they had mp5s, ar-15s, and shotguns. some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were. the atf's initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous. > the b-d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. the b-d were > quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any > time. a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have > achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of > magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige. airplanes > and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch > apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties > than 80. > > allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious > risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the > question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over > a prolonged period. the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared > koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. rather than go > in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon. > > > can you think of a better way of getting the children out?

"freed om of religion" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small arsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. "i'll come out as soon as i finish my manuscript on the seven seals." oh, ok, david. i agree that koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his supporters helped inflate his ego. that doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a shitload of serious weapons. or that he was banging thirteen year olds and twisting their impressionable little minds. this was no move fuck-up. a helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. there were no cs canisters... a specially modified abrams was pupming the stuff in. no chance of starting a fire there. kerosene lamps? maybe one, but not three fires. no way. koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. i expected this to happen. maybe they wanted it to look like murder. he had 50+ days. i think this was coming the whole time. he didn't even put the children in the buried bus or the underground bunker during the cs seige. he put them up into the tower to die. fuck all of you "big brother" paranoid freaks. the only good thing to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to attract some of the more rootless members of our society. joe.kusmierczak@mail.trincoll.edu

"we don`t need to lead with a tax increase...." "it starts with a middle-class tax cut..." "i`ll have the bills ready the day after i am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....it will be the most productive in modern history." "i will ask congress for a line item veto.." "i will lift the social security earnings test.." i personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right, rather than the other way around. that way i have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights. i am sick of the abuse of government power. as tom jefferson said: "when all government,..., shall be drawn to washington as the centre of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated."

i came across the following notice in the denver post classified secction this morning (april 26, 1993): \begin{quote} notice: the denver post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy or sell assault weapons. the denver post finds that the use of assault weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers. \end{quote} now i suppose the post is within its rights to refuse such ads. however, the second sentence is so noxious, i feel compelled to bring it to the attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership. i called the post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure. according to the supervisor i spoke to, the post was reacting to public complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads. however, she said the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy. i strongly encourage denver post readers to call and make their feelings known. eric e. snyder department of mcd biology ...making feet for childrens' shoes. university of colorado, boulder boulder, colorado 80309-0347
|this was no move fuck-up. a helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound |that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously. did anyone notice any helicopters equipped with thermal imaging equipment? they usually manifest themselves in a turret in the front of the helo, or a sphere on top of the rotor with optical elements. i didn't notice any uh-1s or other helos equipped as such. did they use handheld military thermal scanners? if so, there is no recording capability, and hence the credibility of the report is subject to human error.

i'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions: the brady bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to it in congress? did bush veto it? if so, when? also, the state of virginia, i believe, just passed a gun control bill on febrauary 25 of this year. i think it limits gun purchases to one a month - is this correct? what was the bill number? anyone?
everyone is complaining about the debacle in waco. it is hard to understand all this angst. what happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen. why all the sour grapes ? batf was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. it would have been ever so easier to grab koresh and his central followers as they shopped in waco. alas, no propaganda value there. the fbi screwed-up big time, all the time. they should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. a quick second assault, before the bds could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. the bds themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. they imagined that us law and us law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country'. wrong ! they had no right whatsoever to fire on the batf, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. if the bds had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like the rest of us. if they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to do. what they may not do is decide for themselves what us law applies to themselves and which does not. they get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth. if the batf and fbi have become latter-day gestapo, then they have become that way because we have desired them to be so. we get to vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. by our choices over the years, we have approved the creation and form of the batf and fbi. when the fbi was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. when the batf is raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand. when the fbi is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the public doesn't mind. suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out of shape. suprise ! you reap what you sow. waco was an encapsulation of the all-american experience - religious fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. don't blame it on 'them', the fbi and batf. they were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years. we made 'them'. we are 'them'. -- jim mason

(unless you are a congressman) 	sure, the situation was handled badly by both the batf and 	the fbi. it would have been all so easy to detain koresh and 	his core members while they were out in the streets of waco. 	the batf, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a 	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big 	commando-style assault is proof of that. they should be 	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. on the 	other hand, they did have the legal right to do what they did. 	once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and 	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that 	take root. 	the fbi also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again, 	the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created 	them, gave them the right to do what they did. if batf and 	the fbi are latter-day gestapo, it is because the voters have 	allowed them to become that way. waco was pure americana - 	militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated 	violence all rolled into one experience. we get what we pay 	for, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices 	we have made over the years. don't blame 'them' - blame 	ourselves. we made 'them', we are 'them'.

------------------------- original article ------------------------- the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal's article on paxton quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the journal tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t.p.g. type folks, i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it. the text follows. the colorado daily, btw, is the university of colorado (boulder) student (i think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (the title was the only thing they changed/added) "gun stats" the daily recently reprinted an article from the wall street journal, primarily concerned with paxton quigley, author of "armed and female." the article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the new england journal of medicine. the article states, "a study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." this is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: the study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you. the study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. the study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'. this would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check. possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. the nejm study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense. especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. statistics available from the fbi and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. d.f. taylor cu department of chemistry and biochemistry -- spooksmoke: revolution, assasination, thorium, cobalt-60, clintin, cia, nsa, shc dod #202 / loki@acca.nmsu.edu / liberty or death / taylordf@ucsu.colorado.edu send me something even you can't read... -----begin pgp public key block----- version: 2.2 mqcnaitfksqaaaeeakceejwi9f5kmjykp0logc5dghrpbmy2xhoo8kpehmdyuf8a 1bfdqsj53kostz6hroshsdzlvul1/40vpjmmntfr+vyz4jvd3rl4iuq2ummmex3m itf3ult8xn/v/qabsvhcfshvjvk4lf6wosucmo03m2tix31ai7vb0uzo4yxjaaux tcreyw5pzwwgribuyxlsb3igpexva2laywnjys5ubxn1lmvkdt4= =s5ib -----end pgp public key block-----

(2) a "gun safety" class is politically correct, and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts) and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms. (4) some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) it improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general. our students see that we are all reasonable, non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner. even anti-gun students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think about" with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. our course is the standard nra-certified "home firearm safety" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials. we also teach the nra's "personal protection" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. i think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs. -- alane -- /-----------------------------------------------------------------\ / nobody shares my opinions, | "i am a jelly doughnut" \ / especially not my employer | -- president john f kennedy \ /-----------------------------------------------------------------------\

a friend recorded cnn news during the gassing and incineration of the bd's. i went through it carefully today, and found something very interesting. a tank is pulling out of the house, and there is a fireball, maybe 24" across that lasts for about 1 second. exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts billowing out of that area of the building. now, i'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a weather balloon or something. perhaps someone would check it out and comment.

i have never spoken for a ban against guns in america ! what i've said is that there seems to be to many of them, and especially to many in wrong hands.... now if you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting good/responcible gun owners ?? i do believe in a persons freedom. what i don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it. most europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you have to give 'a little' to make that society work. cars and guns should really not be mixed, i just tried to make a point. like america, norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b, so a car is essential in most parts.... guns on the other hand are not essential in norway, so we don't argue that if we 'banned' guns we have to ban cars..... everyone who believe that hitler and ww2 could be avoided if there were more guns in germany in the 30's: please read some history! is this discussion about 1. banning weapons for all americans or 2. making it harder for criminals to get one ?? change of name....... wrote that one after reading the first postings about the waco 'incident'. i still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy or make a new newsgroup. (if you read the first postings after the waco fire you should see who i mean......) did the batf get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.

[...] the gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters sunday morning, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ witnesses said. the agents had warrants to search for guns and explosives and to arrest howell, said les stanford of the atf in washington. [...] witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home, throwing concussion grenades and screaming "come out," while three ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ national guard helicopters approached. for a moment, there was no response. then the shooting began. i think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussion grenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault). > he was not just another guy minding his own business. hell, give them all > the guns in the world if they don't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort, > don't you think? the sort of person you'd want your daughter to date? i ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ probably not. but then again, neither are you. > then he fired on the atf. that's not just a little mistake, or some > red-white-and blue american defending his home against big brother. that > shit doesn't fly. anyone with his background that will shoot and kill ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ and just what is "his background"? what prior crimes had he been convicted of? > federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ sorry, batf are "federal tax enforcement officials". they're not police, nor do they have police powers. -- charles scripter * cescript@phy.mtu.edu dept of physics, michigan tech, houghton, mi 49931 ------------------------------------------------------------- "... the people cannot be all, and always, well informed. the part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. if they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ..." thomas jefferson, nov. 13, 1787
i wrote a letter the other day to empower america - the organization which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake of the republican defeat last fall. some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run. you'd be close to the truth. their two leading spokesmen are bill bennett, former 'drug czar' who heartily supported bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and jack kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. these are conservatives ? anyway i thought it interesting that when i ran word perfect's spell check against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'bennett' : 1. banned 2. bayonet needless to say, i found these choices rather amusing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "it [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict. men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. the savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. civilization is the process of setting man free from men." -- ayn rand : 'roark's speech from the _fountainhead_' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ i don't speak for my company. we hire the 'politically correct' to do that. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but i've never thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or competence. i just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that can't wait a few days. i can think of plenty of bad reasons for not wanting a waiting period: i want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right now, i've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and i can't afford to spend the night here, etc. i'm not a big fan of guns, but i feel that it is important to guard american's rights to own them. on the other hand, we license and regulate many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights. carl

gun clubs: if you are a member you can borrow weapons....(suprised??) you are supposed to train with a .22 for the 6 months, then you can start with anything bigger. drivers licence: forgot that usa is the land of cars..... getting one in scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy. average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather...... but we think this is acceptable because a car is not a toy, and bad drivers tend to hurt others. (if you are really bad, you won't get a lincence!) abuse by the goverment: this seems to be one of the main problems; any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment.(!) either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) or you should get a new goverment. (you do have elections??) guns 'n criminals: most weapons used by criminals today are stolen. known criminals can not buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control. and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia (and most of europe), we dont have any problem with smuggled guns. mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: what i meant was that cars can kill, but they are not guns! someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to... i don't think we should argue on this one..... ;) the issue (i hope..): i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem. guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??) i think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)jugoslavia: they should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them to kill other (innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns. if 50% of all murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, it's the 'axer' ?? (an example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...) think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. is this a good situation ?? is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ?? if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ?? (i mean if everybody had a gun in usa) don't flame the englishmen because of northern irland, they have gun control that works (in england) and fonds from usa are one of the reasons why ira can bomb innocents...

so this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease lesser causes such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, hiv infection, or diabetes. oh, okay charles, that makes a lot of sense. i tell you what charles, i'll call the heart foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes of death. and you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles. i've got an idea charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group? this is talk.politics.guns. don't confuse the issue. just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another, we should not try to address it? i don't agree. i'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths. i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it. >> i assumed that any humane >> person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents >> gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. > >a "humane person" who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old >would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm; >ignorance is our greatest enemy. > again charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes. the statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority. i guess, maybe humane person and rational person could be interchangeable huh? both would be defined as "a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths." if that is the case, i'm extremely glad that i am inhumane and irrational. >> well joe, i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >what _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their >data? these folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts. >perhaps you can verify their data with the uniform crime report... > sorry charles, the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting the facts. but if you insist, according to the 1990 ucr, "firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990" is the national center for health statistics good enough for you? they state that "every day, 12 american children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides. many more are wounded". or how about the national pediatric trauma registry? they say "gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990." do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles??? they state that "gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988." charles, i hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns. if you don't realize this fact, (i don't care if you go by cdc or fbi data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), i'm not going to bother to try to convince you. its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion. i really don't want to do that. >> or the centers for disease control. > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >they have firearm statistics? are firearms a disease? > charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the cdc. they don't just study cancer and heart disease. i've got news for you, interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic. in 1984, surgeon general c. everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents. >> that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths. > >in "the lives of youths" or in their schools? i know a number of >youths who have firearms present "in their lives". is is quite >appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms (this is a >"presence", right?). what are you trying to say? this innuendo >reminds me of listening to bill clinton. who the f**k said anything about teaching children to safely handle firearm charles??? in the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1 sentence that you decide to respond to. what the hell are you saying here??? you're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn't. > >> the cphv reports that 135,000 youth bring guns to school daily and that >> 400,000 bring guns to school at least once a year. > >i wouldn't trust their statistics without *independent* verification. > >> the cdc estimates >> that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once >> in 1990. > >based on cphv statistics?

> charles buddy, i'm getting really tired of this. do you live on the planet mars??? as a physicist, i realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but i really think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools. in addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids. ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot. believe me charles, that will be your *independent* verification. ########################################################################### rodney w. thomas r1328@vmcms.csuohio.edu urban child research center cleveland state university cleveland,oh. 44115 ########################################################################### >--

a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of the free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. i know that as a canadian, i don't have much to stand on... but, i think that the right to keep and bear arms is very important to maintaining a free society. the america is still the most enviable place to live on this earth (by anyone with their head on straight) and will stay that way only if more people stand-up publicly for what they believe!! remember, that if you stand for nothing... you'll fall for anything... including "well-meaning" socialists, they did in canada. later ted

hb 1776 is for concealed carry in texas. it provides for licensing citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction course (30 hours, if i remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for 4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal character, etc. while i don't agree with all of the criteria, i feel it's high time that pro-gun types fight the same way hci et al. do -- by getting incremental changes in the law. daryl daryl biberdorf n5gjm d-biberdorf@tamu.edu + sola gratia + sola fide + sola scriptura
