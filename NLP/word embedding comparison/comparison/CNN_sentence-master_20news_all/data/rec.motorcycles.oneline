"tap plastic" is a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes replacement of plastic bits. telephone in the bay area is 415-962-8430. i'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping. i have found that they have several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from windscreens and face shields. also they have one called "lift-it" which works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic wihtout scratching same. luck, jonathan jefferies, jeff@mri.com
this is a periodic posting intended to answer the frequently asked question: what is the dod? it is posted the first of each month, with an expiration time of over a month. thus, unless your site's news software is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available. this witdodfaq is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in an attempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed to rec.motorcycles. last changed 9-feb-93 to add a message from the kotl, and a bit of halon. 			version 1.1 this collection was originally assembled by lissa shoun, from the original postings. with lissa's permission, i have usurped the title of kotwitdodfaq. any corrections, additions, bribes, etc. should be aimed at blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ contents: how do i get a dod number?	by blaine gardner	dod #46 dod "road rider" article	by bruce tanner		dod #161 what is the dod?		by john sloan		dod #11 the dod logo			by chuck rogers		dod #3 the dod (this started it all)	by the denizen of doom	dod #1 the dod anthem			by jonathan quist	dod #94 why you have to be killed	by blaine gardner	dod #46 the rec.moto.photo.archive	courtesy of bruce tanner dod #161 patches? what patches?		by blaine gardner	dod #46 letter from the ama museum by jim rogers, director dod #395 the dod rules			by consensus other rec.moto resources	by various keepers	dod #misc the rec.moto.reviews.archive	courtesy of loki jorgenson dod #1210 updated stats & rides info	by ed green (dod #111) and others ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 			how do i get a dod number? if the most frequently asked question in rec.motorcycles is "what is the dod?", then the second most frequently asked question must be "how do i get a dod number?" that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list (kotl, accept no substitue keepers) for a number. if you're feeling creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can make a request, subject to kotl approval. (warning, non-numeric, non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl. not that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.) oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. you'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too. by now you're probably asking "so who's the kotl already?". well, as john sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. first, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though john was the original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, the kotl's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the kotl shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie mailers"). fourth, there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a dead-head. ***************** newsflash: a message from the kotl ****************** once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl, please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done. your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two. during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotl's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader). if you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the kotl *memorizes* the list?!?). *********************************************************************** one more thing, the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. so provide some information for the list, will ya? the typical dod list entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. for example: 0111:ed green:ca:ed.green@east.sun.com (ps: while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of denizens who lack one or both.) blaine (dances with bikers) gardner blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------ "denizens of doom", by bruce tanner (dod 0161) [road rider, august 1991, reprinted with bruce's permission] there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do. they discuss motorcycles and motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops, helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship. they argue with each other and plan rides together. the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face. the members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer. the computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers; the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users. currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per month; it is read by an estimated 29,000 people. most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually referred to as the dod. the dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes. fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "denizen of doom." a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. 0003 keeper of the flame. bruce was then designated dod nr. 0002, retroactively and, of course, nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given dod nr. 0001. the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so john sloan -- dod nr. 0011 -- became keeper of the list, issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one. to date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the united states and canada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france, germany, norway and finland. keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch. the initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately. the profits from this went to the american motorcycle heritage foundation. another amhf fund raiser -- selling denizens of doom pins to members -- was started by arnie skurow a few months later. again, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation. so far, the denizens have contributed over $1500 to the ama museum. a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage museum. as often as possible, the dod'ers crawl out from behind their crts and go riding together. it turns out that the two largest concentrations of dod'ers are centered near denver/boulder, colorado, and in california's "silicon valley." consequently, two major events are the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern california "joust." the ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big barbecue dinner. the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern california ride south; riders from southern california to ride north, meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle. an additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus, ohio, in july. though it's a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to get together. long may they flame. "live to flame -- flame to live"	[centerbar] this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything like that face to face. these insults are known as "flames"; issuing them is called "flaming." flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network. a typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like: "what an incredibly stupid statement, you spandex-clad poseur!" this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds_ by john sloan dod #0011 periodically the question "what is dod?" is raised. this is one of those questions in the same class as "why is the sky blue?", "if there is a god, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations. a long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the dod membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it "the denizen of doom". not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod #2 to post it for him. dod #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so. flaming and other amusements followed. he who would become the holder of dod membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membership number. perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically. it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. it could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members. in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by dod #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on vhs by #18)! where will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell. the dod has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address. the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name). live to flame - flame to live ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the dod daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by 	chuck rogers, car377@druhi.att.com, dod #0003 :-( dod )-: :-( x __ __ x )-: :-( x / / \ \ x )-: :-( x / / -\-----/- \ \ x )-: :-( l | \/ \ / \/ | f )-: :-( i | / \ / \ | l )-: :-( v \/ __ / __ \/ a )-: :-( e / / \ / \ \ m )-: :-( | | \ / | | e )-: :-( t | | . | _ | . | | )-: :-( o | \___// \\___/ | t )-: :-( \ \_/ / o )-: :-( f \___ ___/ )-: :-( l \ \ / / l )-: :-( a \ vvvvv / i )-: :-( m | ( ) | v )-: :-( e | ^^^^^ | e )-: :-( x \_______/ x )-: :-( x x )-: :-( x rec.motorcycles x )-: :-( usenet )-: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the dod by the denizen of doom dod #1 welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

i mean like i like riding my yuka-yuka fudgeo-jammer 11 but what the heck. stompin: no way, the bmw is it, complete, that's all man. terrible: nahhhh, you're sounding like heritick ratatnack! hey, at least he is selling his bmw and uses a hopalonga intercorruptor! not as good as a puff-a-cane, should have been called a woosh-a-stream. stompin: you mean wee-stream. terrible: waddya going to do? call in reinforcements??? stompin: yehh man. here comes arlow scarecrow and high tech. let's see what they say, eh? muck: now men, let's try to be civil about this. high tech: hi, i'm a 9 and the bmw is the greatest. arlow: other than my b.t. i love my bmw! terrible: b.t.??? arlow: burley thumpison, the greatest all american ride you can own. muck: ahhh, look, you're making terrible gag. terrible: what does bmw stand for anyway??? muck, arlow, high: beats me, wilhelm. terrible: actually, my name is terrible. hmmm, i don't know either. muck: say, here comes chunky bear. chunky: hey, hey, hey! smarter than your average bear! terrible: hey, didn't you drop your bmw??? chunky: all right eh, a little booboo, but i left him behind. i mean even villy ogle flamed me for that! muck: it's okay, we all makes mistakes. out of the blue the west coasters arrive, led by tread orange with dill snorkssy, heritick ratatnack, buck garnish, snob rasseller and the perenial favorite: hooter boobin brush! heritick: heya terrible, how's yer front to back bias? terrible: not bad, sold yer bmw? heritick: nahhh. hooter: hoot, hoot. buck: nice tree hooter, how'd ya get up there? hooter: carbujectors from hell!!! muck: what's a carbujector? hooter: well, it ain't made of alumican!!! made by tilloslert!! muck: ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!! dill: well, where do we race? snob: you know, chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't ride! muck: no! no! quiet! tread: bmw's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion. they even have luggage made by sourkraut! high: my 9 too! terrible, heritick, dill, buck: nahhhhh!!! stompin, tread, high, chunky, snob: yesss yessssss!!! before this issue could be resolved the hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including polyanna stirrup and the infamous booster robiksen on his cavortin! polyanna: well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like i use on my hopalonga evening-bird special. helpful for getting it up on the ole ventral stand! terrible: hopalonga's are great like polyanna says and yuka-yuka's and sumarikis and kersnapis are good too! booster: i hate cavortin. all: we know, we know. booster: i love cavortin. all: we know we know. muck: well, what about mucho guzlers and lepurras? snob, tread: nawwwwww. muck: what about a tridump? terrible: isn't that a chewing gum? muck: auggggg, waddda about a pluck-a-kity? heritick: heyya muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself? muck: no, no. there is more to mudder-disciples than arguing about make. two more riders zoom in, in the form of pill turret and phalanx lifter. pill: out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever. phalanx: hey, i don't know about that. and now even more west coasters pour in. road o'noblin: hopalonga's are the greatest! maulled beerstein: may you sit on a bikejector! suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: kite lanolin: hey, bmw's are great, men. robo-nickie: i prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally. more riders from the west coast come into the discussion: aviator sourgas: get a burley-thumpison with a belted-rigged frame. guess gasket: go with a bmw or burley-thumpison. with a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. it was none other that clean bikata on her hopalonga cabammerxorn. clean: like look, hopalonga are it but only cabammerxorns. muck: why?? clean: well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin. muck: but i only have a 4-banger. clean: no good! chunky: sob, some of us only have 2-bangers! clean: inferior! stompin: hey, look, here's proof bmw's are better. the bimmer-boys burst into song: (singing) beemer babe, beemer babe give me a thrill... road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: wadddoes bmw stand for? heritick, stompin, snob, chunky, tread, kite, high, arlow: beat's me, wilhem! road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: oh, don't you mean bmw? and so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the greatest mudder-disciple (g.m.d.) of them all boomed out. g.m.d.: enough of your bickering! you are doomed to riding bigot & suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. all: no, no, no!!! puhlease. does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes? are our arguing heros doomed? tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of "the yearning and riderless" with its ever increasing cast of characters. where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done. next week's episode will answer the question of: "to helmet or not to helmet" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ script for the denizens of doom anthem video by jonathan e. quist dod #94 [scene: a sterile engineering office. a lone figure, whom we'll call chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white cdc lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] (editor's note: for some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the first annual dod uni-coastal ironhorse ride & joust by denizens referring to each other as "chuck". i guess you had to be there. i wasn't.) chuck: i didn't want to be a software systems analyst, cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir, may-i-have-another-sir. my mother made me do it. i wanted to live a man's life, [music slowly builds in background] riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys, living the life of a motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner). in short, 	i want to be a denizen! [chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap. scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted rollins pass. a small throng of hell's angels sit on their harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac. chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat boy.] chuck [sings to the tune of "the lumberjack song"]: i'm a denizen and i'm okay, i flame all night and i ride all day. [hell's angels echo chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: he's a denizen and he's okay, he flames all night and he rides all day. i ride my bike; i eat my lunch; i go to the lavat'ry. on wednesdays i ride skyline, running children down with glee. [chorus]: he rides his bike; he eats his lunch; he goes to the lavat'ry. on wednesdays he rides skyline, running children down with glee. [chorus refrain]: 'cause he's a denizen... i ride real fast, my name is chuck, it somehow seems to fit. i over-rate the worst bad f*ck, but like a real good sh*t. oh, i'm a denizen and i'm okay! i flame all night and i ride all day. [chorus refrain]: oh, he's a denizen... i wear high heels and bright pink shorts, full leathers and a bra. i wish i rode a harley, just like my dear mama. [chorus refrain] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ why you have to be killed. well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the dod started as a joke. and in the words of one denizen, it intends to remain one. sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "what does dod stand for? it's not the department of defense is it?" naturally, a denizen who had watched the movie "top gun" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied: "that's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you." and the rest is history. a variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for. notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include: daughters of democracy (dod 23)		doers of donuts dancers of despair (dod 9)		debasers of daughters dickweeds of denver			driveway of death debauchers of donuts			dumpers of dirtbikes note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the rec.moto.photo archive first a bit of history, this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive. not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. a few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the dod membership list, the dod yellow pages, the general rec.motorcycles faq, and this faq posting. here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive. ********************************************************** via ftp: cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21] via e-mail: the address is server@cerritos.edu. the commands are given in the body of the message. the current commands are dir and send, given one per line. the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications. for rec.moto.photo the file spec is [dod]file. for example, you can send: dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ascii. oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send. a 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50k each; not a good idea. -- bruce tanner (213) 860-2451 x 596 tanner@cerritos.edu cerritos college norwalk, ca cerritos!tanner ********************************************************** a couple of comments: bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? second, since bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (california time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ patches? what patches? you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches & pins. and your reaction was probably: "i want!", or "that's sick!", or perhaps "that's sick! i want!" well, there's some good news and some bad news. the good news is that there's been an amazing variety of dod-labeled widgets created. the bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. this isn't because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no "dod store" that keeps a stock. all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets. the typical procedure is someone says "i'm thinking of having a dod frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the ama museum. anyone want one?" then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). so if you want a dod doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action. here's a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise (and perpetrators). patches (dod#11), pins (dod#99), stickers (dod#99), motorcycle license plate frames (dod#216), t-shirts (dod#99), polo shirts (dod#122), zippo lighters (dod#99) [ltf ftl], belt buckles (dod#99), and patches (dod#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand]. all "profits" have been donated to the american motorcyclist association motorcycle heritage museum. as of june 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the dod. if you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the founders' wall in the name of "denizens of doom, usenet, the world", complete with a dod pin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ here's a letter from the ama to the dod regarding our contributions. ~newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~from: arnie skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~subject: a letter from the motorcycle heritage museum ~date: mon, 13 apr 1992 11:04:58 gmt i received the following letter from jim rogers, director of the museum, the other day. "dear arnie and all members of the denizens of doom: congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the denizens of doom! with your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500. on behalf of the amhf, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the denizens. the club's new plaque is presently being prepared. of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our founders foyer. by the way, i will personally mount a denizens club pin on the plaque. again, thank you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the museum, and the fulfillment of its goals. sincerely, jim rogers, d.o.d. #0395 director p.s. please post on your computer bulletin board." as you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally, it was meant for all of you who purchased dod goodies that made this amount possible. arnie ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the rules, regulations, & bylaws of the denizens of doom motorcycle club from time to time there is some mention, discussion, or flame about the rules of the dod. in order to fan the flames, here is the complete text of the rules governing the dod. 			rule #1. there are no rules. 			rule #0. go ride. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 		other rec.motorcycles information resources. there are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not have anything to do with the dod. most are posted on a regular basis, but they can also be obtained from the cerritos ftp/e-mail server (see the info on the photo archive above). a general rec.motorcycles faq is maintained by dave williams. cerritos filenames are faqn.txt, where n is currently 1-5. the dod yellow pages, a listing of motorcycle industry vendor phone numbers & addresses, is maintained by bob pakser. cerritos filename is yellow_pages_vnn, where n is the rev. number. the list of the dod membership is maintained by the keeper of the list. cerritos filename is dod.list. this witdod faq (surprise, surprise!) is maintained by yours truly. cerritos filename is dod_faq.txt. additions, corrections, etc. for any of the above should be aimed at the keepers of the respective texts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (loki jorgenson loki@physics.mcgill.ca) has provided an archive site for motorcycle and accessory reviews, here's an excerpt from his periodic announcement. ********************************************************** 	the rec.motorcycles.reviews archives (and world famous llama emporium) contains a veritable plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories) reviews, written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences. these invaluable gems of opinion (highly valued for their potential to reduce noise on the list) can be accessed via anonymous ftp, email server or by personal request: anonymous ftp:		ftp.physics.mcgill.ca (132.206.9.13) 					under ~ftp/pub/dod email archive server:		rm-reviews@ftp.physics.mcgill.ca review submissions/questions:	rm-reviews@physics.mcgill.ca note: there is a difference in the addresses for review submission and using the email archive server (ie. an "ftp."). to get started with the email server, send an email message with a line containing only "send help". note: if your return address appears like 	domain!subdomain!host!username in your mail header, include a line like (or something similar) 	path username@host.subdomain.domain 	if you are interested in submitting a review of a bike that you already own(ed), please do!

[thanks to ed green for the above addition.] also worth mentioning are: the first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the moab/canyonlands area of southern utah. riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster bmws to itty-bitty xrs to almost-legal 2-strokes. and though it's not an "official" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in steamboat springs, colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather. there's also been the occasional labor day gather in utah. european denizens have staged some gathers too.

"shit, matty, it could have been worse. that could been my flhs!" jeff hadn't made it 10 inches. witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage. matty was quick. while jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature. twenty minutes later, when jeff's color had paled to a flush, matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing. that was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing. or he could buy the bike. i'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that matty told me he ran the charge through in december and that it went uncontested. -- stephen manes					 manes@magpie.linknet.com manes and associates				 new york, ny, usa =o&>o

re: waving... i must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as i meet other bikers while riding does a lot of good things to my mood... while riding is a lot of fun by itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "hey, it's a great day for a ride... isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time on the road on days like this..." with a gesture. was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were down there for similar reasons (there's this great stretch of road on the way down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... went on an impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who i didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless. as a fellow commented to me while i was admiring his bike...

ok, i saw a bike today and i want to know what it is. lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately hawk 650. additionally, it had a cbr900rr style tank, full fairing, and only a tach. now, at first i thought it was an 'rc31' (a hawk modified by two brothers racing), but i did not think that they made this huge tank for it. additionally, the gauges were certainly not from a hawk. they looked much more like 900rr gauges. overall, the bike looked like a 900rr except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the hawk) so, what did i see? (ps, for any of you boulder doders, i saw it parked at the engineering center today. it is white with light green stripes.) ________________________________________________________________________ nick coburn dod#6425 ama#679817 '88cbr1000 '89cbr600 coburnn@spot.colorado.edu ________________________________________________________________________

"well sir", meekly the defenant replied, "i just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and i was on my way home." he offered nothing more or less. just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home. the judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school. isn't america great?? -------------------------------------------------------------------- bill mohrman 81-cb900c motorola , sps columbus, oh ------------------- disclaimers apply ------------------------------

what's the feeling about eating and riding? i went out riding this weekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie. the whole ride back i felt sluggish. i was certainly much more alert on the ride in. i'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides. from now on, a little snack will do. i'd much rather have a get that full/sluggish feeling closer to home. -paul -- paul nakada | oracle corporation | pnakada@oracle.com dod #7773 | '91 r100c | '90 k75s

as summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made... me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local state forests. for that i was planning to get a backpack/rucksack. the next question is how shall i carry the thing on the bike, given the metal frame and all. i have a big backrest (approx 12" high) and was hoping that i would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest. any one have any experiences on such experimentation? taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully loaded with a full load (40lbs). is the load distribution going to be very severly affected? how will the bike perform with such a load clinging to the back rest. if i really secure it, with no shifting, do i still increase my chances of surfing? collective r.m. wisdom requested. p.s. i really can't afford leather pants. boots and jeans are all i can make do with. what you think of the knee protectors which rollerbladers use - the one l.l.bean and like sells. is that a bad idea (tm). are there any equivalents? -- '81 cb650 						dod #1224 	 i would give my right arm to be ambidextrous!

this morning a truck that had been within my sight (and i within his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that i existed and pulled over right on me -- my front wheel was about even with the back edge of his front passenger door as i was accelerating past him. it was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him as he slewed over (with no signal, of course) on top of me, with my little horn blaring (damn, i need fiamms!), but the satisfaction of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough, especially when i later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made no apologetic wave or anything. is there some way that i can memorize the license plate of an offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner? i'm not going to firebomb houses or anything, i'd just like to write a consciousness-raising letter or two. i think that it would be good for bdi cagers to know that we know where they live. maybe they'd use 4 or 5 brain cells while driving instead of the usual 3. -- curtis jackson	 cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com	'91 hawk gt	'81 maxim 650 dod#0721 kotb '91 black lab mix "studley doright" '92 collie/golden "george" "there is no justification for taking away individuals' freedom in the guise of public safety." -- thomas jefferson

according to bbc radio this morning, uk, denmark, portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit ec-sold bikes to 100 bhp. the reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a rare example of governmental wisdom. the limit has a five year moratorium on it, and "specialist" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the market in europe to triumph, norton (who? :-)), bmw, cagiva & ducati is the sort of dangerous rubbish which stalls gatt talks. you heard it here first. bill @ univ edinburgh, replete with 12 hp and a healthy blue exhaust.

i was wondering if anybody knows anything about a yamaha seca turbo. i'm considering buying a used 1982 seca turbo for $1300 canadian (~$1000 us) with 30,000 km on the odo. this will be my first bike. any comments? thanks. peter how institute of space and atmospheric studies university of saskatchewan, saskatoon, saskatchewan canada (306) 966-6452 in::how@skisas.usask.ca ********************************************************************** * 1983 clapped-out ford truck * **********************************************************************

my old jacket is about to bite the dust so i'm in the market for a new riding jacket. i'm looking for recommendations for a suitable replacement. i would like to buy a full aerostich suit but i can't afford $700 for it right now. i'm considering two basic options: 1) buy the aerostich jacket only. dunno how much it costs due to recent price increases, but i'd imagine over $400. that may be pushing my limit. advantages include the fact that i can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit. 2) buy some kind of leather jacket. i like a few of the new hein-gericke firstgear line, however they may be a bit pricey unless i can work some sort of deal. advantages of leather are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper than upper aerostich. requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out lining, it must have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics. please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc... steve -- -- steve andersen dod #0239 andersen@me.udel.edu (302) 832-0136 andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu 1992 ducati 907 i.e. 1987 yamaha srx250 "life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry..."

hi, i just have a small question about my bike. being a fairly experienced bmw and mz-mechanic, i just don't know what to think about my honda. she was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to daytona bike week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder. i towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect working order. no cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. all still within factory specs. the only thing i could find, however, was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the clymer-manual for this bike. any syggestions??? what else could cause my problem??? do i have to hone the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? won't that increase the wear of my pistons?? please send comments to 	sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca thanks in advance. stef. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ stefan ruhl german exchange student. don't poke into my privacy !

i'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about fighting my ticket. many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your case in court. others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lost because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness. several of you suggested that i obtain a book called "fight your ticket". the general theme from those who said "go for it", was to be prepared. i should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge, and to be positive and assertive. i am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp> a few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his day off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you. one individual stated that an officer could be an expert witness, and if he says i was speeding, then by damn, i was speeding. another says that i must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun. lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all. i'll let you know what happens after the big day! /-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\ | peter d. nesbitt | air traffic controller | pnesbitt@mcimail.com | | | oakland bay tracon | | \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/

grf. dropped my shoei rf-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it... so i cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes. then, while it was drying, i realized that i was out of smokes and that my cage is not currently running... so i "had to" take my bike down to the store. not wanting to mess up my paint job, i said "well, heck. i can just use my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface... i didn't notice a big difference when i switched to the shoei, but switching back was really bad... 1) doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to back... 2) with a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, i normally ignore the face shield until i get up to about 30ish... with this one, taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind. the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely passenger?

yo, did anybody see this run of hard copy? i guy on a 600 katana got pulled over by the police (i guess for speeding or something). but just as the cop was about to step out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in georgia. ang then, the cop gives chase. now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!! everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet battle at about 100mph. what happened at the end? the guy (who is being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights) slows a couple of times to taunt the cop. after blowing a few stop signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street. the kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance machine and he slams on the brakes. of couse, we all know that cages, especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our high performance machines. so what happens?... the cage plows into the kat. luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt. but dude, how crazy can you get!?! yeah, we've all went out and played cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!! how crazy can you get!?!?! it took just one look at a zx-7 who tried this crap to convince me not to try any shit like that. (although the dude collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the kawasaki team colors still looked good!!! just a few scratches, like no front end.... 3 inch long engine and other "minor" scratches...) if you guys are out there, please, slow it down. i not being an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that annoying ass noises...), but just think... the next time you punched it (whether you have an all mighty zx-11 or a "i can do it" 250 ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any time. peace & ride (kinda) safe. warren -- "have suzuki, will travel..." wcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu "what's the big deal about riding one of these. i'm only going... 95!?!?!" - annie (robotech)

from: speedy@engr.latech.edu (speedy mercer) i was attacked by a rabid hubcap once. i was going to work on a yamaha 750 twin (a.k.a. "the vibrating tank") when i heard a wierd noise off to my left. i caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot and jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit hard in the left...

searched without luck for a faq here. i need a left 85 aspencade mirror and honda wants $75 for it. now if this were another piece of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally supplied with i might be able to see that silly price, but a mirror is a piece of safety equipment. the fact that honda clearly places concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough to convince me that this (my third) wing will likely be my last. in the mean time, anyboby have a non-ripoff source for a mirror? keith smith keith@hydra.unm.edu

i can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement. everybody's got an opinion and is dead certain they are right. yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by. the dmv doesn't know. cops don't know. your traffic school instructor doesn't know. the vehicle code only tells part of the story. judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways. and the public at large? i seldom hear any advice that doesn't disagree with something i've experienced. if you don't believe me i suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code, study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens. read "fight your ticket" too, but don't miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're basically screwed. as you may have guessed, i'm pretty down on the system here in california. i've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the message clear that the judge does not appreciate john q public trying his own cases. so here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket: take traffic school if you can. if it's a serious matter get a lawyer. a lawyer can present the exact same case as you, the difference is the sentence. -- paul thompson apple computer

personally, i follow the no alcohol rule when i'm on a bike. my view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike! if i get hurt it's my own fault, but i don't want to wreck my katana. i developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*. i had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00. i wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but i couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30! this made me think about how i viewed alcohol and intoxication. you may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind. i greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just doesn't mix with riding. max enjoyment! eric
-- thanks to all of you who gave advice on the cb900 custom. as recommended, i had the bike compression tested. compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi). they said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low numbers (around 90). does this sound right? otherwise, the bike looked great. no signs of road rash, and no rust. this bike looks great! it is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires. i am opting for the metzler me55 and me33 tires (thanks to those who posted this other thread). this bike is _big_ compared to my other bikes. ( sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the kdx200 was. ) i should be road legal tomorrow. i am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about the transmission and taking my chances. being a reletively new reader, i am quite impressed with all the usefull info available on this newsgroup. i would ask how to get my own dod number, but i'll probably be too busy riding ;-). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | |\/\/\/| ___________________ | | | | / \ | | | | / jamie w. burnside \ | | | (o)(o) ( jburnside@ll.mit.edu ) | | c _) / \_____________________/ | | | ,___| / | | | / | | / __\ | | / \ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------
insurance companies sure seem to go for no-fault coverage. since the majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we would have to pay much higher rates under a no-fault system? with a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the legal costs out of the system. but it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed. -- michael "chuck" bain meb4593@icdfs.ca.boeing.com ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 		 "semi-loud pipes save lives"
now, i am jumping into the middle of this thread so i may not know what y'all been talking about, but i have a few comments: in rec.motorcycles, davet@interceptor.cds.tek.com (dave tharp cds) writes: >1. unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force >air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_. at the time the intake >valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only >the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after >the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric. as the piston decends on the >intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing >atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract. at no time >does the pressure ever become "negative", or even approach a good >vacuum. there are a number of other factors that are very important, the three biggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves. velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes. at a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports. shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion. beyond this i am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves. 	<================================================> / rich sturges (h) 703-536-4443 \ / nswc - carderock division (w) 301-227-1670 \ / "i speak for no one else, and listen to the same." \ <========================================================>

for those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. i just installed a set of bosch air horns ordered from dennis kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 fj1100. they are rated at 93db at 7 meters. i installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. my stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. i soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from napa. 	i installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. you have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. the compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long. 	the relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it. 	i found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. the horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. the back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. there is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into. 	the short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. they end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you). 	if you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and i can try to explain better. if your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first. 	how do they work you ask? they are very, very, very *loud*. they sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. i have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short). 	i've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that i have the horns, they still jump. they are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. the bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the fj. ymmv. -tjk '85 fj1100 with "get out of my way" horns.

i am looking for advice on buying a susuki gs1100e. does anyone out there know about any inherent flaws the bike may have or problems i should look for? what about insurance rates (is this bike blacklisted)? also, as a person who has never ridden a motorcycle yet is buying a 1100 to start off with.... am i crazy? i have been told by some people to start out small.... and by others that i am lage enough to handle an 1100 right off from the start (6'4" 210 pounds) because some others might be a tad bit small. oh yeah, one more question. anybody in the chicago area know of any good instruction schools or programs where i could get aquanted before i just go buy one and kill myself getting it home. thanks, brian p.s. please email me direcly because i do not get much of a chance to read your group... thanks again.. :)

ok -- so we've got a hotly contested bmwoa election and some inept leadership. my question is the history of the bmw organization that lead to the formation of the bmwra. was there something going on in the oa years ago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups? just to stave off flames: i'm a (relatively new) member of both groups and besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines, it seems the major difference is that the ra guys seem to have more fun. . . art -- art campbell artc@world.std.com 72227.1375@compuserve.com dod 358 _real_ bmws have just two wheels.

i'm a biker and a dog-lover. first and foremost, i want to mention some common sense. if it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision. only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first. second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language. how you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent. third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog. dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy. to a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him. you need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class. you are god: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. but god is also amused by one who properly submits to his dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) a dog bisquit! now, how does that all relate to biking? well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility. the msf suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception. just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone. dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of. with a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary. this is the face off. first -- and there is very important -- make sure you never face off a dog on his territory. face him off on the road, not on his driveway. if necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him). stand your ground, then slowly advance. your mental attitude is that you are very angry and are going to dispense terrible punishment. the larger the dog, the greater your anger. dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear. and, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death. most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage. they'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment. the interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them. the more effective you are at communicating body language, the less you actually have to do. after 7 years with my 93 pound beast, i've learned a few tricks i think...

yo, whaz up!!! earlier, i was reading on the net about using splitfire plugs. one guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell. well, i saw one think that someone said about "show me a team that used split- fires...." well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages. splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages. well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing torque. they weren't focusing on horsepower numbers. now how does this related to us high performance pilots? well, that depends. do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? in the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. so for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power. but what about twins?... many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see doug polen vs. scott russell, daytona 1992). however, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands. so how does this translate? increased torque should "theoretically" help twins make more power. splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in. now i don't know about all of this (and i'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but splitfires should help twins more than 4's. as far as racing teams.... ducati team "fast by ferraci" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had jamie james running for em), but i don't know why they stopped since then. also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88..... peace. warren wcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu "have suzuki, will travel..." at a local "fix-er-up-er" shop, the bike repairest looked at a dumped zx-7. then he asked the guy... "what happened..." "i dumped the clutch..." "how fast..." "pretty fast..." "insurance..." "nope." the fixer smiled..... "what do you know about bikes?" "not much....."

so it looks like i'm going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage for a few months, starting several months from now, and i'm already contemplating how to do it so they're as easy to get going again as possible. i have everything under control, i think, besides the batteries. i know that if i buy a $50.00 battery tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage, they'll be fine. but i'm not sure that's necessary. i've never heard anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't so great. but maybe someone can tell me. would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, i could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged. what's wrong with this? on a related, but different note for you bay area denizens, wasn't there someone who had a bunch of spare edta a few months back? who was it? is there still any of it left? thanks for any and all help! 	-- robert

(i suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event i were to sue them.) the bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs. the only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected. note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not. another point to consider when purchasing a lid. -- ken franklin 	they say there's a heaven for people who wait ama 	and some say it's better but i say it ain't gwrra i'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints dod #0126 the sinners are lots more fun, y'know only the good die young

several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so i didn't have to slow down. however, a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that scottish terrier. apparently, it was following the 1st dog. henceforth, if a dog decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. i've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black gl1200i which has a pretty loud oem horn (not as good as fiamms, but good enuff) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. i'd def feel more vulnerable on my '68 trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels. if there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner i wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much imho compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury. any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate. graeme harrison (gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com) dod#649
help! i've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle. this is great! unfortunately, she needs at most a 28" seat. this is not great. so far, the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy-looking kz440. so, it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there. anybody know of models (old models and used bikes are not a problem) with a 28" or lower seat? and, since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ), she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser. so there's bonus points for listing tiny standards. i seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through several months ago. did anybody keep that list? thanks! -- gregory bean dod #580 bean@ncar.ucar.edu "in fact, everything's got that big reverb sound..."

hello everyone. i'm new to motorcycles so no flames please. i don't have my bike yet so i need a few pieces of information: 1) i only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that i'm too ignorant to know i need to buy) 2) what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance? i turn 18 in about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a motorcycle is going to insure (i live in washington dc if that makes a difference) 3) any recommendations on what i should buy/where i should look for it? 4) in dc, as i imagine it is in every other state (ok, ok, we're not a state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then get a learners permit. however, i'm wondering how one goes about learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence and b) not kill oneself. i don't know anyone with a bike who could teach me, and the most advice i've heard is either "do you live near a field" or "do you have a friend with a pickup truck", the answers to both of which are no. do i just ride around my neighborhood and hope for the best? i kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs. it's still the big city and i'm about a mile from downtown so that doesn't seem too viable. any stories on how you all learned? thanks for any replies in advance. 	-greg humphreys 	:wq 	^^^ 	meant to do that.

sigha. 1) trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my cb360t... are there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)? 2) was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough" incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. so i went and picked up this cheapo "motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "very good charge"... start the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even register. it's supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is ok, but it stays down at the same point as just the battery. my question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, how the heck is the battery staying fully charged? i'd think it would be darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc... do the '75 cb360t's have a problem with their charging system? are they just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes? is there an easy fix for this? 3) happy noise: put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an endorsement.... which is really good, because my cage just quit running worth a damn and i won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) and the weatherman says "bright and sunny all week, 20% chance of rain on friday"... <big grin, bugs in teeth>
one of those "morning, just getting the coffee in me" thoughts: waving at other bikers makes more sense than just "hey, how's it going, nice to meet you on the road, have a good ride" 1) if you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention is on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages. 2) it keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when you're in a cage. this is a good thing.

(my first bike was 13 years old when i bought it so i went on my friend's advice instead.) also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street. i basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage bmw's running around and they were generally set up the way i wanted. nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms. dealers in the boston area, at least when i was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although i ended up buying both bikes in private sales. -- david karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu) -- '80 bmw r65 dod #0969 also bmwmoa, nra, aclu, et al.

greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts! background ---------- the racing listserver (boogie.ebay.sun.com) contains discussions devoted to racing and racing-related topics. this is a pretty broad interest group. individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering, motosports enthusiasts. the size of the list grows weekly. we are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from new zealand, australia, germany, france, england, canada finland, switzerland, and the united states. the list was formed (october 1991) in response to a perceived need to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise ratio found in rec.motorcycles. anyone is free to join. discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be "flame-free". how to get the daily distribution --------------------------------- you are welcome to subscribe. to subscribe send your request to: race-request@boogie.ebay.sun.com traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day (depending on the topic). nb: please do _not_ send your subscription request to the list directly. after you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive an rsvp request. please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list. the request is generated in order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site. upon receipt of your rsvp, you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution (as per your initial request). how to get the digest distribution ---------------------------------- it is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a single email message). the roadracing digest is mailed out whenever it contains enough interesting content. given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day. should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every 30-40k or so), please send a subscription request to: digest-request@boogie.ebay.sun.com how to post to the list ----------------------- this is an open forum. to post an article to the list, send to: race@boogie.ebay.sun.com depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may not see the mail that you have posted. if you want to see it (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out) you can include a "metoo" line in your .mailrc file (on unix based mail systems). bounces ------- because i haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message. occasionally, sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive bounces from the race list. check the headers carefully, and if you find that the bounce originated at sun (from whence i administer this list) contact me through my administration hat (race-request@boogie.ebay.sun.com). if not, ignore the bounce. other lists ----------- two-strokes: 2strokes@microunity.com harleys: harley-request@thinkage.on.ca or uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request european bikes: majordomo@onion.rain.com (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto) thanks, be seeing you, rich (race list administrator) rich@boogie.ebay.sun.com -- stefan fielding-isaacs 415.822.5654 office/fax dba art & science "books by design" 415.599.4876 voice/pager ama/ccs #14 * currently providing consulting writing services to: gain technology, verity *

(stator and/or regulator/rectifier problems.) my first bike was a (about '82) gs650, it server me well. the honda nighthawk series (this may also be known as the cb### series i think). eg. honda cb450, cb650, etc. this is another series of standard motorcycles. also fairly dependable. kawasaki and yamaha probably have similar bikes, but i don't know them as well. for mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs. hope this helps, -david (dagibbs@qnx.com)

sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st1100. finally, the 17th was a saturday without much rain. in fact it cleared up, became warm and sunny, and the wind died. about three weeks ago, i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles! 128 for a test ride. they had sold, and delivered, the demo st1100 about fifteen hours before i arrived. and the demo vfr was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon. today was different. there were even more bikes. 50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. some sort of fat bike convention. shelly and dave were running one msf course each, at the same time. one in the classroom and one on the back lot. plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer. hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party. after about ten minutes of looking for rob c, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot. we went over the the controls, i put the tank bag from the hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag. ( thats nice.... ) having helped push the st out to the lot, i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people. he rode it like a bicycle! 'it cant be that heavy' i thought. well i was wrong. as i sat on the st, both feet down, all i could think was "big". then i put one foot up. "heavy" came to mind very quickly. with cindy on the back -- was she on the back? hard to tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road. by 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear. even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure. cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride. about 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where i95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway. it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton, manchester-by-the-sea and newbury on its way to gloucester. on its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to andover. on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots. perfect, if slow, sport touring sections. cindy has no difficulty with speed. 3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear. this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk. lane changes were a new experience. a big heft is required to move this thing. responds well though. no wallowing or complaint. behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial. top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. smooth, smooth, smooth. not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant. if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz. the jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes. its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn. a real squeeze is needed on the front binder. the section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban. the st works ok in this section, but it shows its weight. we went by the clam shack oft featured in "spencer for hire" -- a place where you could really find "spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133. after putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128. about half way through the onramp, i yanked cindy's wrist, our singal for "hold on tight". head check left, time to find redline. second gear gives a good shove. third too. fourth sees dod speed with a short shift into top. on the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic. did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new. well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok. tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns. time to wick it up? i went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat. and stayed there. when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering, i looked down to find an indicated 135mph. not bad for 2-up touring. beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit. at the "get off in a mile" sign, i rolled off the throttle and coasted. i wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness. it was a good idea: there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp. back to the slow and heavy behavior. cycles! is about a mile from 128. i could see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off. i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front. heavy. it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand. i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute. my demo opinion? heavy. put it on a diet. smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the dod speed. i'd buy on for about $3000 less than list, just like it is. too much $ for the bike as it is. -- 	 frank evan perdicaro 				xyvision color systems legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 edgewater drive inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572				wakefield ma outhouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285

after reading the service manual for my bike (suzuki gs500e--1990) i have a couple of questions i hope you can answer: when checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not? i am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read. the dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it. do i remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without screwing it down before reading? the service manual calls for the application of suzuki bond no. 1207b on the head cover. i guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material. do you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute? my headlight is a halogen 60/55 w bulb. is there an easy, brighter replacement bulb available? where should i look for one? as always, i very much appreciate your help. the weather in philadelphia has finally turned warm. this weekend i saw lotsa bikes, and the riders all waved. a nice change of tone from what philadelphia can be like. . . . chris -- ******************************************************************* christopher g. karras internet: cgkarras@world.std.com

one point not yet mentioned: 	hands on the driver's shoulders are a definite no-no. it feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms, and a shoulder massage feels good too, but the shoulders are connected to the arms, and the arms to the handlebars... should you hit the brakes, the pressure on the shoulders can make steering interesting. bundle her up if it's cold, make sure she has good gear (say it again), an pat her thigh to let her know all is great. good luck!		mike

since at least one other person was interested in this: my fzr's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired. yesterday i bought a can of vht 1500 degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand. sprayed on paint. thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month. soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree temperatures. the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't be available for months at least. they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating. the other shop said they have 2 coatings available. one is aluminized that can do 1200+ degrees and is "comparable" to powder coating for durability. the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is thinner and not as durable. both coatings have a textured finish (not super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush. price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100. i'm planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (ups) next week maybe wednesday. sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks. axel
being a mere female, i have often found i can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so i found a more subtle and nastly ooops i mean nasty way to get back at them. if somebody cuts you up, just wait till they have pulled out past you, and then gently lean over and bend their aerial, every time i have done that it has eventually snapped off near the base - which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace. gillian

hola amigos, quiero... i need an answer to a pressing question. i now own two bikes and would love to keep them both. one is a capable and smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great brakes; the other is a beemer g/s, kind of rough for the city but great on the long road and backroad. a good start at a stable, but i don't think it's going to work. unfortunately, insurance is going to pluck me by the short hairs. unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount. they do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of driving one of the things at a time. i don't think i'll ever manage to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (turn left... accelerate the zephyr; turn right... accelerate the beemer.) does anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to discount your rates? state farm doesn't. by the way, i'm moving to the bay area so i'll be insuring the bikes there, and registering them. to ease me of the shock, can somebody guesstimate the cost of insuring a zr550 and a r800gs? here in tucson they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two, per annum. muchas gracias, 			enrique

(i've had people try to dismount 	 in traffic, just as i'm pulling in to a parking space!) 	- muffler gets hot! ('nuff said) 	- we get *good* traction. we're not going to fall over.

(this is important to 	 stress. for example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to 	 watch the speedo like a hawk: i drove her to the beach down 84, 	 and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, "slow down! i'm scared" 	 i humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with 	 the spare piece of duct tape i keep stuck to the top of the cluster. 	 problem solved: she watched the scenery instead of the 	 instruments, and had a much better time. based on her 	 experience driving a lincoln continental, she was unwilling to 	 trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.) usually i'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up. watch out for gravel on the mt. hamilton road: there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones. it doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the first trip! good luck -- have fun! -- don't drink soap! dilute dilute! ok!

i know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an r bike only list (and limited to the r80* r100* bikes as well i believe) i've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is. please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list! there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it be about bmw's. i don't care which bmw, any and all are welcome. i will probably post articles that appear in the local bmw club newsletter, and would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech articles. to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address: bmw@rider.cactus.org with the word subscribe (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having the word subscribe in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief. ** your from: line must have a valid return address ** ** the list sw will use the address in your from: line ** if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained in your from: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and i'll take care of it manually. the list sw will hack up the outgoing message from: line so that your original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending on your mail interface natch. i use elm so that's what i wrote it for :-). keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors parentage. to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address with the word unsubscribe (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having the word unsubscribe in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief. the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the mta isn't the smartest around, but i've managed to hack it up enough to make a decent list mta. additions and removals are handled automatically by scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount of time (my link is via uucp and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and i'll look into it. if the list turns out to be too popular and the mta groks over the number of addresses, i'll have to freeze the list recipients until i can come up with a better mta. good luck... -- joe senner joe@rider.cactus.org joe@mpd.tandem.com bmw mailing list bmw@rider.cactus.org austin area ride mailing list ride@rider.cactus.org

i bought a yamaha xs850 with 8k miles. over the last 2 years, i've put 30k of commute miles onnit. valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every 5k. well every 7.5k or so, i've checked the pad clearences, and they never change! if anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right? i know that threaded adjusters can tighten up, but i didn't think these kind could. bottom lines is that i haven't touched my valves for 30k on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter... what's the deal? any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals?

(btw, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in orange county and sf were 750 gsx's and ninjas). probably the biggest reason bmws aren't ripped off is that most people who buy bmws will only deal with the actual bmw dealer, or mail- order types. most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. for harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. there is a huge aftermarket in harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. ditto the non-sport japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. for the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. it's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. the other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable. mike -- disclaimer - these opiini^h^h damn! ^h^h ^q ^[ .... :w :q :wq :wq! ^d ^x ^? exit x q ^c ^? :quitbye ctrlaltdel ~~q :~q logout save/quit :!quit ^[zz ^[zzzzzz ^vi man vi ^@ ^l ^[c ^# ^e ^x ^i ^t ? help helpquit ^d ^d !! man help ^c ^c :e! help exit ?quit ?q ctrlshftdel "hey, what does stop l1a d..."

about a year and half ago when i first started riding, i took a msf course. i have taken those lessons to heart. over the past year i have had only a few near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels. yesterday i got to add another to the list but with this one i felt the most helpless. i am sitting at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion. suddenly i hear screeching tires. i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the bike. luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel. i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you really in actuality avoid such an incident? suggestions?

(hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high cg of the concours! :-) |especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off |by such a trival tactic. warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft, |the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your |property! i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock |of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned. what tactic are you referring to? if we don't know what you are talking about, we can't very well guard against it, can we? for my money (literally) i rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm with pager when i'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, c&c insurance, and i try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people about. (see, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious, they'll set off the alarm.) that's for a nice bike. for a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would want to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make a profit on the deal. :-) seriously, if i (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week, and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking, but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light. i usually rig the cable locks i use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them, the concours alarm goes off. and i have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there. the only thing i have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm). oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off. that's the best that i can think of. most of the locks i see people put on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound. i like abus, since i have personally removed master locks from lockers with my boot. dave svoboda (svoboda@void.rtsg.mot.com) | "i'm getting tired of 90 concours 1000 (mmmmmmmmmm!) | beating you up, dave. 84 rz 350 (ring ding) (woops!) | you never learn." ama 583905 dod #0330 cog 939 (chicago) | -- beth "bruiser" dixon

(note: my bike is bright white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.) - on a flat road, i stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually about two or three bike lengths). this will (hopefully) give me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches. - if you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors *constantly!* if you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out of the way *now!* - flicker your brake light. if i'm the last vehicle in line, i will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-). i vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice that there's something in the lane ahead of him. now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line that i feel most defenseless. if you're first in line, your forward escape route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that you don't enter the intersection. i leave some room behind the stop line (although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors. i *think* i've decided that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation. any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind you? -rob. -- rob griffiths | erasure.shonalaing.wildswans.b52s.u2.judybats.rem.smiths robg@apple.com | faa certified cloud basher i wanna drive the zamboni!

my kawasaki kz 750 l4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle, in other words, i can move the axle sideways & up-and-down for few millimetres to each direction. this doesn't bother me when riding, but i guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. last summer i took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job. all i would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find there. well, upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. it seems that, in addition to removing the cover, i would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket. question : would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (don't know the exact term in english, sorry) ? question : has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose ? does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ? thanks ! teppo nieminen dod #2000 zoo mc helsinki finland

i have a '72 cl350 which i stopped riding about 2 years ago (i upgraded to an '84 sabre 750). i parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned on draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store. well, after a lot of procrastination, all i ended up doing was throwing a tarp on it. well, now i have to move and want to clean up the 350. i tried starting it (with someone else's battery) and had no luck. my first guess is that it is the gas and so i plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (i can only pray that i didn't trash the carbeurators). the question is, what do i do with this old gas? i am not going to run it in my sabre, and i think that there is enough that i don't want to burn it (campus police don't think too kindly about bonfires). dumping it isn't a great idea. thanks for any ideas, george heinz ---- win the $1,000,000 question -- what does this c code do?

(witness the infante thread recently....) the other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has a few weaknesses as well. in the first place, it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other. in the second, discussing someone's personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. (or is that slanderous? i can never remember the difference.) this leads to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a bad thing. finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic. i can't haul my big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general. in summary, blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect. while it may be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable. you also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and i'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning. the same goes for anyone who looks like you, too. ----- tommy mcguire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com "...i will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information, identifying it as personal and as independent of ibm...."

there was an article in one of the u.k. dailies this week about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the field after a collision with a ford sierra cage. seems the cage driver wanted to turn around, but needed to drive onto the pitch to do this, so he waited till the ball and most of the players were up the other end. unfortunately, as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down the pitch, the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal, straight into the cage!

a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger: there's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes i used to ride in the uk it was hard ! i'm now riding a gs1100 and that's great, even moving from my freinds gsx600 i was riding recently. this may be due in part to the fact that neither i, nor my regular passengers, are particularly slimline ! i always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes their movements predictable. my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all, i don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods. again that may be biased by the fact that i've had a couple of new passengers (a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight, making any kind of maneuvering difficult. i've also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit. i recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back. we have a code system for turns, stop and for 'i need to shift position'. -- chris seabrook, fujitsu open systems solutions inc | phone: +1-510-652-6200x118 6121 hollis street, emeryville, ca 94608-2092, usa | fax: +1-510-652-5532 | dod: #0861 per saltire gules and or, a sun counterchanged.
unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the corbin gunfighter and lady with passenger backrest for my hawk gt. it came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would. installation would have been very easy, but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat! it never was easy to put on. once i figured that out, the new seat went on the first try. the passenger backrest, though, does not fit as i thought it might. the supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit, and i have not yet found a suitable, hard, ( sae grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits. there is a a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back. the driver's section of the seat is a bit wider. seems comfortable enough, but then again i put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought. the passenger's section has about 8 times the volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it seems much more comfortable. the backrest helps a bit, but i've not has enough time to really test it. the backrest also comes with a small pocket. its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 10" taller seat. if i go on the three-notch ride soon ( dixville, pinkham & smugglers), i'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an improvement. -- 	 frank evan perdicaro 				xyvision color systems legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 edgewater drive inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572				wakefield ma outhouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285

yes, matt, dear newbie, best advice is read here foe a few days. this is your best source of info.

hi. i'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable. they are. there's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the locking head notch in. thus, each link is a possible locking point. also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "look" a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks (imho) and i think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally functional. finally, i notice that when i ride with my leathers, harness boots, and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (btw, i've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights. i love my cobralinks almost as much as i love my pre-80's honda dinosaur. (i think i have a pavlovian drool reflex-i put the lock on (i.e., on my body) and i can feel the bike already shaking away). my first post. what did i do wrong :)? sang dod #0846 '80 cx500 p.s. any other cx500 owners out there? please e-mail me. got questions about the weird handling on my bike. -- the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the university of north carolina at chapel hill, the campus office for information technology, or the experimental bulletin board service. internet: launchpad.unc.edu or 152.2.22.80

because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike. the things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same. ergo, if he's asking advice, i reasoned he doesn't have much practice, period. if you say he does, fine. i still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a road that's all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not to mention the bdcs and squids who will also be on that particular road. he asked for advice, and even though it wasn't what he meant, i still consider it some of the best i've read. lee

i was privelged enough to experience my first volvo attack this weekend. i was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding down rt. 40 in groton ma. at the side of the road, sitting off on the shoulder was the killer volvo in question. no brake lights, no turn signal, nothing. we were doing about 40 mph and i was following the cage in front of me about 2.5-3 sec. back. well, as said cage passes the volvo, the brain dead idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around... so i get on the brakes in a effort to not t-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the bdi up. as she finishes the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending stare. where can i get rocket launchers for the vfr? dean -- | dean cookson / dcookson@mitre.org / 617 271-2714 | dod #207 ama #573534 | | the mitre corp. burlington rd., bedford, ma. 01730 | kotnml / kotb | | "the road is my shepherd and i shall not stop" | '92 vfr750f | | -sam eliott, road hogs mtv 1993 | '88 bianchi limited |

hello folks, i'm very happy with my "new" r80gs. my range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons... that's 50 mpg!! surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting something rough. she's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much anyplace i'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect, it's more a torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still (when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe i don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence. okay, here are my questions: 1) any recommendations for a home-made fairing? i'd like to keep the wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds (70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my vision too much for trail riding. anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings? i'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas. 2) i run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar. the illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.) combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day. but i've heard that bmw alternators don't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm puttering around in the dirt at low rpm? 3) this is embarassing: i'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning. i invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section of the paper, and then she starts right up. is this a zen thing? 4) the hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives... yeah, right. what do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol? any particular brands of gas that are best? additives? thanks, /-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\ | | | dod# 88888 asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu | | '90 kawi 550 zephyr (erik asphaug) | | '86 bmw r80gs | \-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/

hi boys and girls. i just bought a beemer r80gs and realized abruptly that i am a grad student. i first sold my truck yesterday but i need to sell my zephyr too. if i can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in a couple of weeks. otherwise i'll tag and insure it and see what happens. it's a very sweet bike. 6100 miles, almost all highway (az-wy-co last summer, plus some great rides between here and the border. purchased new exactly one year ago (apr '92), it's a '90 model. it has a good fairing and a luggage rack. red; very clean. perfect maintenance, no bullshit. i'll spare any further details other than to say (1) i want to keep it, and (2) somebody 5'7" +/- 5" will fit it like a charm. not a bike for big people, but not a small bike. standard, upright positioning and good-looking. smooth power, great brakes, good karma. 				- erik /-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\ | | | dod# 88888 asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu | | '90 kawi 550 zephyr (erik asphaug) | | '86 bmw r80gs | \-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/
>i eagerly await comment. the ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the driveway when she sees me coming. probably only hits 25mph, or so. (i made the mistake of waving to a neighbor. she has some sort of grudge, now.) i was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with my front wheel. the dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard me and still had a lead when it hit the road. the dog was approaching from my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of the road before i went by. rover was looking back at me to calculate the final trajectory. too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph from the other direction. i got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front tire. it managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral imminent doom?) i guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have swerved into my lane. the squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back home, but i haven't seen it since. sniff. sometimes fate sees you and smiles. -rick

in light of the last letter i posted from jeff brody concering the crap that is going on in the moa, (which some folks took not as dissemination of information that i received, but as my own bad mouthing) i thought that i would post this one, which came to me yesterday. this is from board member robert higdon to moa pres chich morse. this is not my words, o.k. guys? april 4, 1993 re: cecil king's nominating statement dear chick: we have a very serious problem with the election for president of the moa this year. cecil king's nominating statement (as it appeared in the owners news) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws. in pertinent part, the rules state: "each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words. the nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length. obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task. had cecil's statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with the word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his position statement. as a result, cecil has obtained what i view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president. this does not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the process. i would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election. parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, i would be most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences. with kind regards, i remain, robert higdon o.k. moa'ers, you read it, think for yourself, i trust you do know who cecil king is, and that he was editor befor don douglass, and he is a pres. candidate. i let you draw your own conclusions. regards, craig vechorik bmw moa ambassador #9462 bmw vintage bulletin tech editor dod #843 "real bmw's have two wheels" <-- politically correct statement
hey now, i'm having the roughest time getting a company to cover my new bike. here are some details about her and me: i'm: single 23 riding with a clean record a homeowner a 'new' rider accoring to most companies not a member of msf or ama yet she's: a '92 cbr600f2 got 150 miles got temp plates still one screamin' bitch of a ride... can you get me some ideas? we can take them to private email to lower the noise on the net. mrr3@po.cwru.edu is a good mail address. i need to hear something soon so i can keep her on the road... thanks in advance, mark -- well-weathered leather, hot metal and oil, the scented country air sunlight on chrome, the blur of the landscape, every nerve aware red barchetta straining the limits of machine and man...

orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (henry prange) offers: %the grips on my gs are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem %in the summer. vibration? bmw's don't vibrate. everyone knows that. i'd agree with henry. the grips are really nice to have in winter, and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer. my only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'. this has been complained about by every reviewer, official and unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips. the 'high' setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable effect, i end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right. this generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves. when i asked the dealer if they could fix it, i received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for the poor design (actually, i was told they worked just like they were suppose to). vibration? what's that? i ride a bmw twin. you can barely tell if the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk sheets. -- ken wallich <wallich@ncd.com> ken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken

"chirping" the tire indicates impending lockup (on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking. i agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use. >in any case, for maximum braking, if (as i suggested) you aim to keep >both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing >exactly as *you* suggest!! true, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills (which is how this discussion started), "keep both wheels just on the point of sliding" is nearly useless information. you need to teach a *technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this. --- ed green, former ninjaite |i was drinking last night with a biker, ed.green@east.sun.com |and i showed him a picture of you. i said, dod #0111 (919)460-8302 |"go on, get to know her, you'll like her!"

i've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent experience passengering with dave edmondson at pilot while in london. i found that it upset the bike much less if i rode with the pilot, that is, if i looked over his shoulder and anticipated when i should hold on hard for braking or acceleration. i tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and luggage. hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to fight. similarly, i held on to the grab handles tightly when dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (i'm a lot bigger than he is...). reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to manage. on the rare occasions when i carry a passenger myself, i absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. that's helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. it's not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility to require it if they want to ride. and i agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like mines/mt. hamilton. that's a nasty place to find yourself in trouble. ------------------------------------------------------------------ godfrey digiorgi - ramarren@apple.com | dod #0493 ama#489408 rule #1: never sell a ducati. | "the street finds its own rule #2: always obey rule #1. | uses for things." -wg ------ ducati cinelli toyota krups nikon sony apple telebit ------

my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. i've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. this time, it didn't work because i didn't have time. riding up the hill leading to my house, i encountered a liver-and-white springer spaniel (no relation to the springer softail, or the springer spagthorpe, a close relation to the spagthorpe viking). actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm. but i digress: i was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. i later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. i saw the dog, and before you could say sipde, he was on me. boom! i took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. i think i saw the dog spin around when i looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy. i next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. the apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped i was not hurt either. i could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. sadly, it has not. so i'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars! interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. delayed pain may have helped me here, as i didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember. what worries me about the accident is this: i don't think i could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was. this is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but i was riding around the speed limit. i worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but i console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. for that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end? i eagerly await comment. ryan cousinetc.|1982 yamaha vision xz550 -black pig of inverness|live to ride kotrb |1958 ajs 500 c/s -king rat |to work to dod# 0863 |i'd be a squid if i could afford the bike... |flame to ryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org | vancouver, bc, canada |live . . . * slmr 2.1a * "he's hurt."

i have a question about tires for my guzzi. it is a '75 850-t. the tires that were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked. i do not have an owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the haynes manual are: front, 3,50 h 18 ; rear 4.10 h 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear. oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the t-3 is listed at 29 psi instead. anyone know the reason? as i know though, the pressure i should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase. the real question i have is this. the old tires that are on the bike are for the front, a metzler touring special, 4.10 h 18, and for the rear an avon roadrunner 4.70 h 18, (120/90) h 18 as marked on each tire. both are larger than that listed in the haynes manual. what does the owners manual recommend, and was it common to go up one size for this bike? also, this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes. any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities? the above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current rear tire). what is the best metric match? the local bmw dealer thought 100/90 h 18 on the front and 120/90 h 18 on the back. he also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices. i am thinking of going with a metzler me33 laser (possibly comp k) on the front and me88 on the back, both in mbs variety if possible (the longer lasting belting system). i already use the me33 on both the vision and fj for the front, and like it, and i thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a me55 might, as well as giving much better tire milage life. any comments? a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. i do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be careful, any other comments i should make? i havn't looked at the rim to check out the make yet, if it is marked. he just told me late yesterday and i havn't had a chance to check the rim type. on another note. i will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?) vetter fairing, and i will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually i would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. it could be fork/handlebar mounted. any suggestions? is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? how about lower bars/clip-ons for it? i would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style. (yes i know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.) -----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company------- edw@boi.hp.com disk memory division, ms475 (208)323-2174 p.o. box 15 boise,idaho 83707 89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98 -----------------------------edward walsh----hewlett-packard company------- edw@boi.hp.com disk memory division, ms475 (208)396-2174 p.o. box 15 boise,idaho 83707 89fj1200;82xz550rj(vision);75guzzi850-t;dod#98

a few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru bmw. the idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to headlights. it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction. i talked to the local bmw dealer about this. i was told that the only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being used in a coming line of bmw clothing (rainsuits). he wasn't aware of anything regarding self applied tape. has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source? thanks, --- steve bunis, sun microsystems ***dod #0795***	93-st1100 itasca, il	 ***ama #682049***	78-kz650

grr. hate the bastard who picked the weather for today. went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the ride was very zen. got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work on her computers with, rainy as all hell. soaked and cold by the time i got home. since i didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, i said "to heck with it" and drove my cage back up. lo and behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm yellow thing i haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when i was 10 minutes into the trip. and me in my cage. oh joy. happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the bike when i first got it, put on an emgo replacement mirror... hated it the entire time that thing was on my bike because i couldn't see a damned thing through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you get a narrow angle wobbly blur)... and i got a replacement windshield for my fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but annoying)... so i spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing them this afternoon. 'bout the only thing i still hate about the bike ('75 cb360t) is the damned "2 d-cell flashlight" headlight. has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? since the charging system on the cb360t can't handle continuous use of a 50w halogen headlight, i was thinking about putting a couple passing lights on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding i do, but wouldn't drain the battery during "normal use" (chiefly day trips and commuting to work and back)...

csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu (charles sundheim) writes: >some potentially cool story stuff here... do share the details. 	how to get a verbal warning for 146 in a 55 it's simple. first, it has to be the first really nice riding day of spring. the bike is back together again, and so are you. grab all your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium or better. head out. 	in ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of gilbert. gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something. having just gotten the bike back together, i thought i'd take it for a short ride and check things out. heading out of town, i went into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit, and started leaning around. the pace quickened as everything felt just right. finally, the road straightened and i was ready for a bit of speed. grab third gear, open her up. at roughly 90mph grab fourth gear. look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind. twist the throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see just how well she's been put back together. 	at 146 (according to radar) i noticed the front fender was flexing a bit. thus, i slowed, pulled off the road, removed my helmet and gloves, unslung the took kit i was carrying in a fanny pack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper pulled in all hot and flustered. 	"have you *any* idea how fast you were going?" "not precisely, no. i was paying attention to the bike and road, not the instruments. i just got her back together last night, and i'm just out here testing her out before i ride it in traffic." 	"my radar says you were at over 145mph. care to tell me why i shouldn't give you a ticket?" "because i was testing the motorcycle away from population and traffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective gear that safety demands?" (note: i wasn't quite that eloquent) 	"say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?" <i was eloquent on my cafe racer replica honda 750, a rat bike> 	"yeah, i haven't had my bike out of the garage in years." <compare riding stories> <pack toolkit, having tightened that fender> 	"so why were you out here?" "i figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through me. if the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, i'm dead. if it holds up out here, then i know it will work right in traffic. i do this evvery year when i rebuild her." 	"not any more. you'll find a better place than *my* highway to do those speeds. if i *ever* catch you speeding on my highway again i'm going to nail you for everything i possibly can. now get out of my sight before i write you a ticket." "yes, officer." 	"and kid, keep your eyes open out there..." <drives off> 	and that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55. i don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me. < dan sorenson, dod #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu > < isu only censors what i read, not what i say. don't blame them. > < usenet: post to exotic, distant machines. meet exciting, > < unusual people. and flame them. >

"slow down" is her either tapping me on the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might. depends on the urgency of the matter :-) "turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit. this is also the sign for "cool! look at that." "i hafta pee" is the same sign as "turn here". "i'm hungry" is the same sign. "go faster" is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee. i usually see "slow down" more often than "go faster". > i really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that > she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated... the best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and pillion on his or her bike. it's incredibly frustrating, because you're in almost no control. now, multiply that feeling times ten, because you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc. pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad. also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and "in the zen of the moment" less. remember this. ---------------------------------------------------- pat loughery [patlo@microsoft.com] seattle, wa 	 dod #393, ama, vme, dioc, 1ksi=2.53 '91 vfr750f, '91 nighthawk 750, '82 seca 650 turbo 		^^^ for sale ----------------------------------------------------

okay dod'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya ! today i was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference- a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible "thunk". i pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. my bike is a kawasaki gpx250r with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a "bank-follower", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn. the stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg. now for the mystery. the stud on the side of the bike that clunked when i turned was absent. i'm fairly sure it was there before the event. there was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been. in fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously. okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ? how can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ? is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ? i'm quite amazed at how this could have happened. in the meantime, life goes on, without a left-hand bank-follower. barry manor dod# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper

i have a 1974 honda cb360t which for most of my purposes runs well. however i expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. that is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th i'm lucky if i can hold speed. if i try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops drastically. put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000 rpm. the top third/half of the throttle range is dead. standing still the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10k). other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the engine becomes a little wavery. that is, at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down slightly. the bike has about 13000 miles on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk. i would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. my thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance. i'm hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth the hassle of any major engine work. thanks, britt park britt@cb-iris.stanford.edu

"seven at one blow!" i exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my terrible weapon of invincibility as i stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile. it was only later that i found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and sears wouldn't fix it or replace it. what i had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt. > sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human, > we have *all* the advantages. exactly: nobody can look quite as silly as we can. :-) chuck rogers car377@torreys.att.com

(unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country) if i can't split (perhaps there isn't room) then i will stop near one side of the lane so i have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped. i watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will! whether i really would have time to move should a car fail to stop, i haven't had to find out yet. some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not! so in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your mirrors until it's all clear. -- paul thompson apple computer

this summer (~july 20) my wife (michelle) and i will be in boston attending my brother's wedding. after the wedding we are planning to motor up to bar harbor, maine to visit some relatives for a few days. our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes) to borrow or rent to ride up to bar harbor and back. here's some important details: i've been riding for ~11 years, (my own bikes for the past 7 years), michelle has been riding for the past 6 years (her own bikes), i've only been involved in one accident which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, i currently own a bmw r90, michelle owns a yamaha virago 700, we prefer cruising over racing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured, and we're nice people. so, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have to be a virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in july, michelle and i would be eternally grateful. in addition to our friendship, you would also have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through minneapolis. in exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner and an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or something. also, any information about bike rentals in the boston area would be greatly appreciated. thanks, scott brandt

yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer. it has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and i myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer. what follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of "squildly" behavior by other customers and/or sales personel: background: i ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into "cruiser" type bikes. my friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones. he wanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer that sold both suzuki and yamaha. the place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. we happened upon a few intruders, most of which had sold signs on. my friend had been bitten. well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, i moseid on outside. the next thing i know, i see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in. i could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, iq <40), but i won't. well they went inside, i didn't think much of it. i figured to each his own. i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back, when i noticed the "hormone gang" talking to other salesdroids/managers. lot's of laughter, jokes etc. no big deal. here is the part that concerned me. the "hg" and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out, where said "hg" members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. at this point, one decided to see how much rubber a katana 600 could deposit in the drive. squids, i thought to myself. but i was appalled that the salesdroids/manager not only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. the girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her "pilot" to quickly catch up. the others followed, making sure there kerkers could be heard as well as felt. i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. i felt the eyes of those in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels. needless to say, my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left. i will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my anger. i only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open mind and doesn't associate me with them. btw, i can't afford a new bike.....

i need help getting my zx-11 (c3) to behave. i've managed to get the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks. i can't do anything with it to make it feel ok. the bike is very stable through the corners (i think because i have the front just right), but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous. it feels like it actually amplifies the bumps. and the damping doesn't seem to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference when the bike isn't moving. i've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from completeley unloaded), but i don't know which way to go. has anyone gotten the rear of this bike comfortable? and if so, what kind of settings (esp. what sag) did you use. i like to corner, but i also would like my kidneys to remain intact. this thing makes the new zx-7 feel comfy.... rbarnes@sdcc13.ucsd.edu

quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain most of their charge if drained and dried well, but i'd throw out the electrolyte and buy some more when you need it. and before anyone says i'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly ok even after several years' storage at the shop. mark fox

my first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run. a big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes i was riding with and tried to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. he kicked the dog a couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying wfo and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly. at the time, i had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell) and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, i pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell) and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. my second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. i wasn't paying very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass. i looked down just in time to see what i was about to run over so i just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. both wheels went squarely over the dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4 lumber. the bike didn't lose any stability at all and i kept on going. after i got to my destination, i found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross. -- ============================================================================= neal howard '91 xlh-1200 dod #686 computrac, inc (richardson, tx) 	 doh #0000001200 |355o33| neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org 	 std disclaimer: my opinions are mine, not computrac's.

after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd slash cut pipes i installed my new bubs (which i had been planning to do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no problem at about 97 db. two points: first, i don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced the db level! so if any other nh riders need to get this done, make sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from the body. second, these bub pipes are bloody terrific. at low revs or cruising through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats a more throaty, purring, rumble. when you open her up to >3000 rpm they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. best of both worlds! russ hughes '92 fxstc dod# 6022(10e20) "the chrome and steel she rides.....collidin' with the very air she breathes..." -- n. young
