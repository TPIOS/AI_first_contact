hi, everyone; i need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster. several weeks ago i posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted an external hd for mac. the scumster - r.e.p. - called my friend and they agreed on a price. my friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in english) paid by check, requesting r.e.p. to call him back when the check arrives and the hd is send. well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is that. phone # that r.e.p. gave is on the answering machine all the time and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not bounce but again there is no answer. i know, that r.e.p. is a student at university of delaware; i have his e-mail address, his us postal address and his (?) phone#. the question is: what is the best way to proceed? thanks in advance for any advice. sincerely, victor levenson (vvl2h@virginia.edu) p.s. the reason i did not put r.e.p.'s full name is that i still hope... p.p.s. if i get enough responses i will post a summary, maybe even on a regular basis. vl -- ==================================== dr.victor v.levenson tel (804) 924 2370 lab dept. of biochemistry internet vvl2h@virginia.edu

jammer ! dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent : aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is, wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik, marcel engelbertink, niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk rolex. enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet meer helpen. for all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch ?!? : in spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's, i announce that i don't have any information available any longer and i won't use the trade name rolex anymore for those fake models. yours fakefully, m.g. engelbertink

hi, 	i have a humminbird hdr200 depth sounder for sale. it has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 	 	all parts are included as well as the installation instructions. it is even packed in the original box it came in. there is no damage to the unit or the transducer. in fact, the transducer was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull. so it led a "sheltered" life. the transducer can be mounted either inside the hull as i did, or on the transom. it cannot be placed in a hole drilled into your hull. 	it is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead (that's where i had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a powerboat. it reads depth to 199' and has a backlit lcd display. it has an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 	i am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that outputs the nmea 0183 information. this little depth sounder works fine and is very stable. 	it is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, i paid 150$. 	the first 80$ takes it, or best offer. 				john r. miller 			catalina 22, #4909 "tinker toy"

********************[ pc game for sale ]****************** waxworks by horrorsoft/accolade (5.25")		 $30 by the same folks who brought you elvira i & ii. i played elvira i & ii, and think that horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with waxworks. the look and feel is roughly the same as in the elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive. the first two games, especially elvira ii: jaws of cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult. this is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy. in one of the four wax works to be explored, there is no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles. the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate rpgs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter. in starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1. one exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving. another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies. this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up. this is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit. another exhibit puts you into jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible. you must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and meet him face to face - but first get a disquise. the last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies. over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans. ********************************************************* - all prices include shipping. - all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - us buyers only please. - all games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured, priority usps. - all games include all original materials including box, manual, disks, and registration unless otherwise noted. the first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to get the game. those just asking questions get no priority until they offer to buy the game. lower offers may be considered assuming no other offers at asking price are made. ********************************************************** -- sam bauer	|	hewlett packard co., (719)-531-4460	|	network test division smb@col.hp.com | colorado springs,co

for sale: precision drafting machine, bruning ogp-0180. solid older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table. without scales. for right handed person. $60/make offer, includes ups/parcel post postage. i'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for excellent drafting machine construction! :-) it's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted the typical office grey popular in that period. it's smooth working, and each of the two "arms" on it measures roughly 24". it has a dual clamp to enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table. --- rick inzero				 rochester!cci632!rdi northern telecom, ltd 			uunet!ccicpg!cci632!rdi rochester, ny					rdi@cci.com

hello, i have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package. both of them came from a compuadd computer i bought last august and am presently upgrading. here are the specs-- motherboard ----------- cyrix 486sl 25 mhz microprocessor chips and technology chipset (scatsx v2.3.6 slslc) 8 simm banks for a maximum of 32 megs of ram built-in floppy and hard drive controllers built-in ports--1 parallel, 2 serial (9 and 25 pin) built-in paradise svga controller with 1 meg of ram (windows drivers inc.) -can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors -based on the western digital wd90c31 chip math co-processor slot 3 16-bit expansion slots and 2 8-bit expansion slots case ---- low-profile desktop very nice grey color 150 watt power supply room for 2 floppies plus hd mouse ----- 3-button microsoft-compatible grey color matches case all original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included. you are probably wondering why i must sell the case with the motherboard. it is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and you would be hard-pressed to fit another mb in it. however, the case and this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly. as you can see, since this board includes drive controllers and a video controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a mb where you would need to get io cards, video card, and drive controllers its just a lot more convenient on the whole i would like to ask about $500 for this whole package. i think this is a fair price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/io ports. all you need to do is add drives, a monitor, ram, and a keyboard. also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from compuadd. i also will entertain all serious offers. please email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu thanks -j

this is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction. if there are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna happen. :) ). after this, any updates will be by e-mail *only*. the entire auction will end as soon as the bids stop coming in. so if you want to get in on this, be sure to bid now. all bids must be made in *at least* 25 cent increments. buyer will pay shipping. (unless you have any particular fancy, it will be us mail 4th class special, with lots of padding). all dragons are bagged. the condition of them vary quite a bit, so i've come up with my own condition system. some dragons may be missing items like the inserts. if you have any questions, feel free to ask. * condition ratings - usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as most of the material inside is in great shape. excellent - ie-"as you find them in the store" very good - still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten good - on down the line very fair/fair - indicates lots of use (but still "decent") poor - indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by scissors). a * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is missing (usually the insert) i'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until the bidding stops) * again if you have any questions, ask away. * arrow $2.50 056 - fair *- top secret module missing - bard tunes - real maps tn.de7 $3.0 073 - good - forest of doom module (detached but included) - inner planes ykchev $1.75 074 - good *- combat computer missing - 4 dragons tn.de7 $1.50 078 - good/vg - monsters - aquatic ad&d module (detached but included) - language lesson geoffrey $1.50 079 - good/vg - top secret module (detached but included) - magic resistance mayla $2.50 081 - fair - high level ad&d module (detached but included) - poison - material spell components uccxkvb $2.00 082 - very fair*- baton races game insert missing - spell research tn.de7 $1.50 083 - good/vg - babba yagga's hut module (detached but included) - unarmed combat geoffrey $1.50 084 - fair *- cover missing - twofold talisman module squidly $1.75 085 - good - twofold talisman module - clerics squidly $1.75 087 - good - top secret module - wildernes geoffrey $1.50 088 - good *- elefant hunt insert missing - falling damage - marvel-phile geoffrey $1.50 089 - good *- creature catalog missing - shields - sci fi tn.de7 $1.5 094 - good - ranger changes - creature catalog ii (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 095 - fair *- cover missing - into the forgotten realms module, detached but included ykcheu $2.75 098 - fair - 9th anniversary - dragons - mutant manual uccxkvb $1.75 099 - poor *- cover missing - treasure trove ii, some pictures cut out thedm $2.50 100 - good *- poster missing - city beyond the gate module (detached but included) - "raised dragon" texture on cover geoffrey $1.50 101 - fair *- cover missing - creature catalog iii (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 102 - fair *- cover missing - valley of earth mother middle level module (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 103 - fair *- cover loosly attached - unearth arcana update missing - future of ad&d - centaur papers geoffrey $1.50 103 - fair *- unearth arcana update missing geoffrey $1.50 104 - fair/vf - marvel module - thieves - cover detached but included geoffrey $1.50 105 - fair - ad&d module - invisibility - cover & back cover detached but included uccxkvb $2.00 106 - fair - cover 1/2 on - variations of paladins - more skills 4 rangers ykcheu $2.75 106 - good/vg - variations of paladins - more skills for rangers arrow $2.50 107 - fair *- cover missing - dragons of glory supplement/questionaire geoffrey $1.50 108 - good - mutant manual ii - environmental effects - cover taped reinforced thedm $2.00 108 - very good - mutant manual ii - environmental effects ykcheu $2.25 109 - good - customizing d&d classes - agent 13 poster geoffrey $1.50 109 - very fair - customizing d&d classes - agent 13 poster missing geoffrey $1.50 110 - very good - house on the frozen lands module -10th anniv squidly $1.75 110 - very good - house on the frozen lands module -10th anniv geoffrey $1.50 111 - good - murder mystery ad&d module ykcheu $2.50 112 - very good - ultimate article index - mesozoic monsters mayla $2.50 114 - very fair - elven cavalier - remorhaz - witch npc class ykcheu $1.75 115 - good - theives - harpies & snakes squidly $1.75 116 - good/vg - 3-d ship cardboard insert - wild animals - dr who uccxkvb $2.50 117 - good/vg - dice odds - creative campaigns - sage advice - bazaar geoffrey $1.50 118 - good - tournaments/competitions - nibar's keep game uccxkvb $2.00 120 - vg/ex - april fool's issue uccxkvb $2.00 121 - excellent - oriental adventures - cardboard castle insert geoffrey $1.50 122 - excellent - 11th aniversary - african beasts - druids uccxkvb $2.50 123 - very good - magic and wizardry thedm $2.25 123 - very good - magic and wizardry arrow $2.5 124 - excellent - aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire uccxkvb $2.25 124 - excellent - aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire geoffrey $1.50 125 - very good - clay-o-rama!

i participated a promotion by a company called visual images. they sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major award. they mislabled my address and i did not receive my package until one month ago. i was mad and angry about how it took them so long to get my package. so i wrote them a letter and requested for a refund. they never return my letter. i was lucky enough to find out their telephone number through operator and received the package. i immediately returned the package and wrote them another letter to ask for refund. the package was returned because they address they put on the package was incorrect. i attempted to call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number. it took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number, but they refused to take any responsibility. i spoke to their manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call yet. but i was able to get their address from their front desk. should i just go ahead and send the package? or should i waite until they call me back? i know there are several people on the net has experience with the same company. i would like to know how they got their money back. if you have similar experience, please advise me. thanks in advance, douglas kou hiram college

dear fellow usenet users: 	i would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement about my printing business. i did not intend this to be an advertisement, but rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing on a regular basis. i was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet. i am only trying to put myself through college. for those of you who requested information, i will write to you privately. for those of you who are having fun flooding my mailbox, i think you can grow up. to offer advice is one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another. thank you, marc me9574@albnyvms.bitnet
after hearing about the mcgovern house story on paul harvey i never had any idea how much it was worth. the autograph is on a senate pass card and is signed 'john kennedy.' i don't remember if it was signed 'senator john kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because i haven't looked at it in quite a while. currently it is in a safety deposit box. i would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction house such as christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. if you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send me an e-mail expressing your interest. i will see what i can do to make a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

i recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused sony tcd-d3 dat walkman, having found someone else who has a unit i personally prefer (and am paying more for). however, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it. (it's probably the most popular walkman-style dat machine out there.) anyway, the guy selling it is bryan davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and here's what he told me: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here is what is included: - tcd-d3 datman. - (2) rca to stereo 1/8" plug cables. one for analog input, one for analog output. - optical digital i/o cable (one lead for input, one for output). - a copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase. the unit is still under factory warrantee. - ac adaptor/battery charger. - rechargable battery. i paid $750 + tax for it so i hope you don't mind if i keep the 60 minute tape it came with (i have some samples on it!). [by the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an extended warranty, which is advised for dat machines, since it costs about $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice. send him mail and ask him what he wants. again, i've used the tcd-d3, and i have to say that i can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is. i've been using one for a little while, and although i had some problems with it recently, i should also point out that the particular one i was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time. (this is the same exact dat machine that was lugged around the u.s. and canada to record the jazz butcher conspiracy for their recent live album.) bryan davis says: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in s.f who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported problem. my problem is that everyone i know already has one. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 'nuff said. the reason i'm not getting it is that i found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug spdif i/o instead of optical (i don't have any optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has some other bells & whistles that the tcd-d3 doesn't. (i am also paying more for the alternative.) note that phono-plug-to-optical spdif adapters are available if you absolutely must have one. of course, it has scms. all consumer decks do. (so do sony minidiscs, by the way.) anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com. -- john davison davisonj@ecn.purdue.edu

i have a 24-pin printer which is an alps allegro24. it's both a fast printer with lq and a very sophisticated design. it has a straight paper path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back (a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current print out). it can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without ever using a computer). you get prompts and menus to pick your current setup and default set up. this was the top of the line lq dot matrix when i bought it three years ago for $399. it is also epson lq2500 compatible (besides it's own modes) and comes with ibm driver software (which i've never used since i own an amiga). has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts. i'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid. cod orders must pay all shipping and cod costs. adisak pochanayon - 608-238-2463 ------- also a light gun and uforce controller for nintendo but with pd driver software to use them on the amiga. the light gun is fully remote (no wires). best offer over $75 ($30 less than my cost and they are both brand new). ---------------------------------- cut here ---------------------------------- jeez!!! it never fails, get in the tub and there's a rub at the lamp! -- the genie from aladdin. pochanay@cae.wisc.edu eddie (adisak) pochanayon check out all of silverfox software's releases.... your amiga entertainment. ---------------------------------- cut here ----------------------------------

hi to all. since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, i'd like to bring this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal became a lemon? as i understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,i am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item i received is out of order. the seller insisted that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that i paid if i send the item back to him and after he is sured it is bad. is this reasonable? basically i would like to believe the seller tells the truth. also, i am positively to say that i've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of the thing. my assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars. i would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my e-mail address. i know there is such a risk that you could lose money. but, how can we make it enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth? chein

time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff that's not being used. some are gems, some are mundane. minolta af 50/1.7 lens for maxxum cameras. new lens, but i guess it'd be best to call it a "demo" since i did not get the literature, box or warranty cards. $30. vivitar 2x converter for nikon f or ai lenses. pretty cute "flip back" tang so it will work with all manual focus nikon lenses - and bodies. it will even couple (and double) a non-ai lens to an ai body. $15. pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens. well actually it's a super-takumar which is what they all were back then. very mint condition. $25. nice hard case for this lens $5 more.. alpex 135/2.8 lens. beautifully made, all metal construction with fine optics. minolta mount. $25. another hard case that fits this with strap can be added..call it $7 more. vivitar 283 flash. the one that made vivitar famous (until the 285 eclipsed it). tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure. $30. universal "roamer 63" folding old "bellows" camera with leather case. uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm f6.3 lens. kinda cool articulated shutter release. decent shape. $20. weston 540 lightmeter. nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a good cross check to built in meters. $7 with case and strap. and finally..the "gems" pentax auto 110 camera with 24mm f2.8 lens. this is the little (and i do mean tiny) slr that pentax made. has interchangeable lenses, but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with split image focus, and completely auto exposure. $70. olympus 35rc rangefinder camera. a really cute little camera with 42mm lens (f2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc. i think this was the predecessor to the xa - and it's nearly all metal. i won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell. $60. olympus om-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 zuiko lens, and tokina sd (super dispersion) 70-210 lens. these are all in very nice to mint condition, except for one little ding on the om body near the film advance lever. lenses are perfect, and the tokina is a very compact, and sharp lens. $225 for the set. that'll do to clean out some of the stuff. feel free to offer on this stuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in shipping it.. for more details call or email. -- alan l. peterman (503)-684-1984 hm & work al@qiclab.scn.rain.com it's odd how as i get older, the days are longer, but the years are shorter!

fellow netters, i have an okidata printer i would like to sell. a description follows: okidata 180 printer including cables for both ibm compatibles (centronics parallel) and commodore (rs-232 - round). also includes power cable, manual, and a handful of computer paper to get you started. this is a 9-pin printer. i recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon. a print sample can be provided upon request. this is a very dependable printer - it never jams or does "weird" things. i have used it with a commodore for about 3 years and am now using it with my 486sx. i use mainly wordperfect 5.1 (see next post) for which i got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the okidata 180 in epson fx mode. when i got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (i got mine from tenex brand new - for a christmas present). i would like to get about $100 or so for it. if you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring (e-mail) and make an offer. - kevin harter

fellow netters, i just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out there (even outside of iowa). i'm sorry if anyone thinks that i am wasting space, but i thought you might want some relief from the "so-and-so is a thief" posts. not that i think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while. after seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, i mailed mr. mark miller a request for his copy of wordperfect 5.1 for dos. he suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when i phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping. that sounded more than fair to me, so i told him that i would send him a check the next day. imagine my surprise when i logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after i had just mailed the money order). after another e-mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - i was the one who he was holding it for. he sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license. this wasn't good enough for wordperfect, so i asked him to fill out one of their forms. no problem - we thought. it took three times to get it to the right address (my fault). anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a workbook that i had no idea was included in the deal. again, he apologized for not sending it before. i now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left. i recoend that if you ever see that mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call. if i had the choice, i would purchase all of my software from him. bravo, mr. miller! - kevin harter

"jack previdi" <p00020@psilink.com> writes, in reply to dorothy heydt reminding us that advertising is not done on internet: 	 as a matter of fact d.j., it does make a difference. 	 almost a half million new users joined the internet last year, 	 many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial 	 use of internet is no more. jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups. business communication is okay. advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay. 	 those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only 	 by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to 	 guide(?) us. i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn't want. you may belong to the public library, but that doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb the other patrons. you're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising) follow. there are secret masters here, just like everywhere else. they're not as obvious as the ones on prodigy, but they're here. no doubt at some point the internet, like everything else, will become grotty enough to carry advertising. at that time i hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like misc.writing. elizabeth willey

hi all i have a korg dvp-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping. for those who've not had the pleasure: it is a midi controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice processor. what can it do with your voice? it can pitch-shift it (change the notes you sing). it can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one time). it can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what you say alone and intelligible. this works well for a "computerized" sounding singer, or robot voice. for those of you who just thought about that, yes - you can do the voices from robo-cop, and the old elo lead-ins with it, and yes - i'm a little red-faced to say that i tried those specifically. for an input, it takes both: xlr (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables. for output, you can have a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired). it has preset setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences. it has a couple of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly. even when we don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio. the manual is included. i never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten. -- oooooooo o o steve hitch oo o oo oo my opinions are my own. nobody would want to oooo oo oo take responsibility for them anyway. i will oooooooooooooooooooooooooo eventually hang for them, but i'm happy. oo oo ooo ooo internet: shitch@imd.sterling.com oooooooo ooo ooo uucp: uunet!sparky!shitch

time once again to clean out the ol' closet. some stuff is up for offers, some isn't. please read carefully. in the make offer department: 	wordperfect 5.0, upgrade copy. includes all disks and all upgrade 	manuals. best offer. 	balance of power, 1992 edition, for the amiga. with manual and reg. 	card. best offer. in the for sale department: 	technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel stereo tape deck. because 	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette 	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing. however, 	i have used it effectively in "tape studio" applications for mastering, 	and it works great. 3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7" reels. 	dual lighted vu meters with record indicators. full auto-reverse 	capable (and the mechanism works, too!). adjustable sound on sound, 	and socket for remote control (i don't know where you'd find one, but 	they used to make 'em), plus a 110vac unswitched outlet. this unit 	is in excellent condition and i have had it rebuilt once since i got 	it--works perfectly. 	price: $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below). 	panasonic kx-p1624 printer. 24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both 	text and graphics modes. warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff 	you expect when buying like-new merchandise. i'm selling it because i 	now have a better printer. this is the wide carriage version of the 	kx-p1124, by the way. test prints are available upon request. 	price: $250.00 o.b.o. or trade. 	excalibur custom pool cue. 19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, irish linen 	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while. i've got too 	many cues as it is, and don't need this one. hits nicely, is very 	straight and in excellent condition. 	price: $125.00 o.b.o. or trade. imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft) 	available for an additional $40.00. trades: i need the following things, and i have no cash of my own right now, so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across. the list: 	amiga rom upgrade to at least 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate 	dos and workbench. 	1 meg agnus chip for the amiga. 	amiga hard drive and controller (preferably scsi). 	ibm-compatible hard drive (and controller if not mfm). this one's 	touchy, as i have a full-height and don't have room for more unless 	i swap out--needs to be above 100m, and i will consider trading a 	good st-4096 in the deal. 	intel 9600ex or 14.4ex or similar external high-speed modem. this is not a complete list, but it's close. if you've got something way off the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point. email responses, please.

i have an old optonica tuner and integrated amp that i no longer use. the integrated amp section does not work right now but should not cost much to fix. i believe that it is just a chip. i have used it as a preamp and it works great! this is a very nice looking and well built set. they both are low profile but the amp is rather heavy. the tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp. the amp is rated at 75w/ch. these peices went for about $850 new. i would like to get $150. obo for the pair. if anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, i have had an estimate done that it should cost less than $50 in parts. please email me if you are interested. i will be moving back home for the summer and will sell it back there if i do not do so here. todd -- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% (___________________________________ % todd premo / / / % purdue universtiy / __	 __ / __ / % environmental engineering

i am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale. i purchased 256 t-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. we didn't have the time to sell the shirts. i have about 175 shirts left and i am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts, even in bulk) (that's $918.75 for 175 shirts) these shirts are jim morris t-shirts. they are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4 colors. (they are clean and neatly folded in a box. if any happen to be damaged i will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace it, your option.) you could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece (the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school event or a organization. i realize it is a big investment, but it could pay off big. i would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a shirt. i will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them more bargaining power. please help me. i do not have the time to sell these shirts and i need the money. i am taking a big loss by selling this cheap. i will give you jim morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices. all prices are negotiable. --truman please email tf26@andrew.cmu.edu and tell all of the clubs in the area about this deal. once they're gone, they're gone (cause i am not a business.)

i recently purchased an ibm monochrome vga monitor from mike damico. the monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. mike's address is apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. if anyone knows how to contact mike and could help me find him i would appreciate it. i am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor but it would be a lot more useful to me if i had the cord as well. traci collins, professor of computer education colorado mountain college tcollins@bridget.newcastle.co.us

if you want another ethernet or serial card, add $50. additional disks are $100 each (i can install a total of three esdi drives). i would consider a trade for a scsi dat tape drive. this box would make a great bbs system or terminal server. it was originally designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users. this is not a pc! it was designed to be a unix box from the start, and it's very fast and exceptionally reliable. it's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep. i am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up. shipping is way too much hassle. call if you wish, or send email. steve scherf (408) 736-2093 home (408) 559-5616 work steve@moonsoft.com scherf@swdc.stratus.com newsgroups: ba.market.misc,ba.market.computers,misc.forsale,misc.forsale.computers,misc.forsale.computers.other subject: for sale: altos 2000 unix machine summary: expires: references: sender: followup-to: distribution: organization: moondog software, sunnyvale, ca. keywords: i have an altos 2000 system v.3 unix system for sale (i actually have two, but one's for me). several years ago these well-known machines sold for $30,000 for the base configuration. this particular one has much more than the base configuration, depending on what you want: - 386 16 mhz cpu. - 8 meg of ram. - fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!

computer equipment garage sale: i've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by me. i've put together a list and indicated what i think each item is worth. this is just my estimate, and i am very open to any offers, including trades. i'm currently looking for some cd-roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies, hd floppy disks, any used macintosh software, a 387-33mhz co-processor, or basically anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...) make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... i really want to get rid of this stuff... ok, here's the list: 52 meg 3.5" scsi hard drive. conner model #cp-3150. i bought this from a guy 	at a swap meet to use with my macintosh. unfortunately, i can't seem 	to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer. the 	guy tested it with his pc, and printed out a copy of the norton disk 	doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (i'll send you a copy) 	i was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so i can't return it to 	him. the drive has many jumpers on it, (which i don't know how to set) 	so maybe that's the problem. i was quite disappointed that it didn't 	work so i'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45 52 meg 3.5" scsi hard drive. conner model #cp-3150. same situation as above. 	i bought both of these drives from the same guy. despite the different 	model numbers they are the same exact drive. same report from ndd 	(i have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45 40 meg sony 3.5" scsi hard drive. sony model #srd2040a. the drive mechanism 	is completely trashed. this hard drive was in my computer (mac se) and 	had a stiction problem. well, repeated banging on the side of the 	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which 	was not too pleasant to listen to. still the scsi controller 	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a 	project.	~$20 65 meg seagate 5.25" hh scsi hard drive. model #st-277n. i originally bought 	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and i though that 	i could fix it. well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine, 	and that it was a controller problem. (motor controller wasn't sending 	proper signals.) well, after taking the controller off the drive, 	looking at it, and putting it back together, i realized that i 	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 	drive to the controller. i tried to solder it, but i'm not that good 	at soldering so i couldn't do it. worked perfectly before i messed 	up. i used it as a temporary drive when the sony (above) crashed on 	me. also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications, 	worth well over $1000. (claris cad, ms word 5.0, think c, 	excel, and many others) 	i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable. you also get all 	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate) i only 	ask that you delete my data files from the drive. i was really angry 	when i broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it. i just don't 	have time to play with it any more.	~$65 at&t isdn 7500 modem. this is for use on digital phone systems. if you know 	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know. i 	have some tech documents on it. is supposed to be the same thing as an 	at&t digital phone, but without the phone part. it seems to be in 	working order (passes self test perfectly ok). i have no idea how 	this is worth... let me know if you're interested. motorola 68881 coprocessor. i haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone 	is interested i will get it tested out, to make sure that it works. i 	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then i spoke to the 	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 	another controller chip. when i was looking around to buy one new, the 	prices were around $100. i will guarantee this to work.	~$65 cga card. half-length. 8-bit. wasn't working last time i checked (although 	i think i was using a bad monitor)	~$5 5.25"	360k floppy drive. ibm drive type 1355. guaranteed to work, 	because when i took it out of the pc, it was working!		~$25 5.25" 360k floppy drive. toshiba model number nd-08de-a. guaranteed to 	work. came out of same pc as above.	~$25 5.25"	floppy drives. can't guarantee that these will work. i don't 	even know if they are low or high density drives. i don't have 	any method of testing them. 		panasonic model number: ju-455-5 acg. there's another 			number on it: 2626-361723. 		panasonic model number: ju-475-2 agg. there's also 			another number on it: h3649-101457 		toshiba model number nd-08de. virtually identical to the one 			above. 	each drive ~$10 3.5" ps/2 drive. these things are proprietary, so i can't test it, but i 	think it works. not sure if it's high density or low density, but i 	suppose someone who is looking for one would know. model number 	dfl413c04a. i think these things are expensive to replace. ~$35 mfm hard drive controller cards. i've got three of these, and i have no way 	of testing them. two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit 	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for 	the 16-bit card w/floppy. interesting cable. seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug. that is, 	standard nine-pin to vga 15 pin. made by hewlett packard. part no. 	d1181-80020		~$10 i've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore. i usually ship through the u.s. postal service (haven't had any problems yet) and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated. well, that's all folks. as i said before, no offer will be refused. if you can convince me to give ocit to you instead of throwing it out, try! i hate to throw away stuff... -wayne wdempsey@athena.mit.edu (617)-225-9349

it's basement cleaning time. this stuff has got to go. i have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box. they are free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up. they've seen very little use. if anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee. i have a lot of serial cables. i have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long, short m-m, m-f whatever you want. most appear to work well with pc serial ports, but i will not gaurantee that. tell me what you want and i'll do the best i can to match. 1.50 ea or 10/$10. shipping included. no cods under $20. (you want to pay a $5 cod charge for a $1.50 cable? go buy the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.) i believe these cables were removed from service at a computer center. they appear to be in good condition and the ones i have used have worked well. i also have a 15 kva exide ups with batteries that needs minor repair, probably a logic board. it weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high. i think they used to run a prime system off of it. best offer over $75, but you need to come pick it up. use this to run your house from your solar panels. i will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff. -- paul amaranth manager user services - office: (313) 370 4541 (also voicemail) (internet) amaranth@vela.acs.oakland.edu | this space (bitnet) amaranth@oakland | temporarily (uucp) ...!uunet!umich!vela!amaranth | empty

/* posted for a friend -- please reply to him */ ++++++++++++++++++++++++ car amplifiers for sale +++++++++++++++++++++++++ i have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale: (2) old-style rockford fosgate 150's. these are great amps, and i've never had a minute's trouble with either of them. i've been running them on high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased with them in that setup, but i've also run them on low end before, and they perform quite well in that situation as well. i'm trying to sell them because i'm considering upgrading to a rockford 650. i already own a power 300, and i've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked in cars. i'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when i bought them was $375.00. if you're interested in both of them, i'd be willing to come down on the price a little bit. (1) precision power 2150. this great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150, and looks brand new. the shroud is unscratched, and it works great. this is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into 2 channels, however, i've also had it running front or back high end before where it did very well. i'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on it. **** please direct questions/replies to hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu **** ============================================================================== == chase hacker "fortune presents gifts not == == chase@cc.gatech.edu according to the book. dcd == == gt0658a@prism.gatech.edu == == hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu == ============================================================================== ------------------------------------------------------------------------ mike goldsman __o o__ o__ o__ o__ 36004 ga tech station _ \<,_ _.>/ _ _.>/ _ _.>/ _ _.>/ _ atlanta, georgia 30332 (_)/ (_) (_) \(_) (_) \(_) (_) \(_) (_) \(_) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ pgp key available upon request just say no to brainwashing

ensoniq sq-80 cross-wave synthesizer: i have an sq-80 for sale. the sq-80 is a powerful performance oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer. i bought it because it has a very large timbral repertoire; it seems to do meaty analog synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital". below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual: o eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo panning for each voice o voice section employing cross-wave synthesis; combine different attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source o dynamic voice allocation: each sequencer track/midi channel has access to all eight voices o a full-featured midi controller keyboard capable of sending eight midi program and volume changes at once. keyboard is velocity sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch. o powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of modulation sources and routings. o a 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary ds/dd disks allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to 1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk. also has a ram-cart slot for patches that is compatible with esq-1 ram-carts. o does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable midi device o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven" programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface o stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening o sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the esq-1 so that sounds and sequences created for the esq-1 can be played on the sq-80. this sq-80 has been the main midi controller in my studio for quite a while now. it has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily used sound source at the same time. the sq-80 seems to have been designed with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer (wincake) in its multitimbral mode. >from a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid. it uses looped short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves are processed with a sophisticated dcf-dca arrangement. the sq-80 is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter. simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds. but unlike most good analog synths, it has a very thorough midi implementation so that it works very well with a midi sequencer. what i really like most about this thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. this sq-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88). it does have an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain to use so i have avoided it. reason for sale: i am selling my sq-80 because i recently joined forces with another individual here in boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them. i recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a powerful but economical master keyboard. pricing and terms: i paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago. i am willing to accept $650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00). i will include a bunch of patches on sq-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the original ensoniq sq-80 owner's manual. price: asking $650.00 (everything) shipping: split shipping (ups surface cod) anywhere in the lower 48 states ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- craig vanderborgh verbex voice systems e-mail: craigv@rad.verbex.com 119 russell street phone: (508) 486-8886 littleton, ma 01460 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i am currently searching for old video tapes of music groups of the early 80's to the late 80's. at first i requested vhs formats, but now i'm accepting either vhs, 8mm, or beta. the type of format i'm interested in are the type that most nite clubs or trendy clothing stores play. if you do have any of these tapes just send me a reply with a few groups listed, i'll reply back if the groups listed are the type i'm searching for. i'll gladly pay you what they are worth or trade for other movie or music videos, thanks. tom. ________________________________________________________________________________ \ /|\ / \ \ / \ \ \ \ / | \ _______________________________ \ / \ | you are now leaving the | \ / | \ | state of southern california| \/ \ | please buckle up. thank | /\ | \ /| you for visiting. | / \ \ / | <<<<the earthquake state>>>>| / \ | \ \ | inet:tsmith@cerritos.edu | / / \ \| ___________________________ | / / | \ || \ || / / \ ||\ / || / \ | \ \||/ / \||/ / \ \ / \ / \ | \/ \ / \ /\ \

i just received a music software winsong for windows and found that it needs a midi/sound card (sound blaster pro is preferred) to have its fantastic features show up. as i don't have the plan to add a sound card now, i am putting it here for sale. it's listed $79.95 on april issue of windows magazine and i paid $84.95 as the total. i am asking around $70 with shipping included. winsong for windows: composer, sequencer (tape deck), and juke box all in one. it's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition. it's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder. up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward and stop. it plays music on any midi compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set, saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many. you do not need to be a musician to use this software. the on-line manual is handy. for musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and stifling aspect. almost new (one week old), unregistered $70 (including shipping) obo (please be reasonable)
