for an upcoming project i want to use 4 megs of dram configured as two 2 meg banks of 16 bit data. i was wondering if anyone out there knows of a dram controller which will handle refreshing the data. it's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy. the only controllers i know of are the ones out of the national semiconductor dram management handbook (1988 edition) eg. dp8429. i would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit. btw, if anyone is wanting to hook up dram to a microcontroller, dallas semiconductor makes a neat chip: the ds1262 serial dram nonvolatizer chip. it uses the spi (i2c) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16mx1 of dram memory. it can use an external battery to refresh the dram when the power is off. price is $11.75 from dallas (quan 1). i wish i could use this chip but its maximum spi clock rate is 1 mhz (too slow for me...). thanks in advance, wayne schellekens <schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca> -- wayne schellekens, ve4wts internet: schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca aecl research ax.25: ve4wts@ve4kv.#wpg.mb.can whiteshell laboratories twisted pair: (204)753-2311 x2317

thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas. i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of exar's xr-2240 timer/counter chip. it is stable down to -50 c and sucks very little power. they show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the rc time constant). in this application, they have two of them cascaded together. the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. in this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. when triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to = 256 x r x c to 65,536 x r x c in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. the beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uf timing cap and a 391k resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. so i can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) of course, that's much more than i need (14 days). but the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. after the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth. power is still a problem though. a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. i like that idea ;-) this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow. anyway, i ordered the xr-2240's to see what i can do with them. should be interesting (as long as i'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off ;-) thanks again everyone... -=-= wes =-=-

recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound. i didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated hv at work, nor are the filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing. on examining the power board, i noticed the largest capacitor with a very bad bulge at the top. naturally, i want to replace it, but i can't find any sources. the electrolytic capacitor is 330 mf at 250wv. it has radial leads, and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8" wide. the dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room. living in the los angeles area, i've been to numerous stores (dow radio, all electronics, itc elect, sandy's, yale elect) with empty hands. can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors? mail order is fine, although i'd rather check out a store to compare the can. i'm going to try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have hv caps.

i want to convert a 500 volt sinewave with frequency between 1 khz and 10 khz, to a 10 volt sinewave with the same frequency, by means of a transformer. the secondary current will be .6 a (600 ma). what kind of transformer should i use (ferrite?) can i buy one? if so, i need a partnumber and supplier if i cannot buy one, how do i go about winding one myself? what core do i use, how big must it be in order not to saturate, what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.? i know little about analog electronics, so i hope some kind soul here will help me out. pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated. thanks, mark de rooi rooi@tpd.tno.nl

hi, i've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vac supply voltage up to approx 260vdv. as the load resistance increases, the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. i need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v). the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and i take the output from across seven capacitors=260v. each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v. if i increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the rc constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need 14 of them, so: 1. what would happen if i connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)? will it, as i assume, increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant? if it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then i will have killed two birds with one stone... as i am experiencing some 50hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out. and 2. can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50hz mains hum. lowest resistance possible ! i've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction....

i've seen several references to split- or separate-beam radars, which i claimed didn't exist. gotta eat some crow here - i wasn't aware of them. all i really knew was that it can be done with one beam. i believe the rest of what i said is accurate, though. mmmmmmm....crow.... (oops-wrong group)
here's one i hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to: in the state of virginia radar detectors are illegal, period. if you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. the fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00. sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too! it used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector. not any more! many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up rf from the radar detector itself. my first reaction was "no way!" but, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors. one news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there. this tends to make one assume there are few false arrest. now, before i get flamed, please understand that i do drive at or near the speed limit. i do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket. but, i do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning. my radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when i am in virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and i intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal. for my fellow hams, i am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the hf spectrum between 10 and 80 meters. microwave enlightment may be necessary. so, the questions are - what do the radar detector detectors actually detect? would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray rf generated by a radar detector, or is the rf actually being emitted by the detector antenna? are any brands "quieter" than others? ============================================================================== randy t. agee - ars wb4bzx | at some point, you probably pondered the p.o. box 2120 - 20th floor | meaning of life, and you came up with a virginia department of education | satisfactory answer, which has or has not richmond, va 23216-2120 | stood the test of time, or you shrugged phone (804) 225-2669 | mightily, muttered "beats the heck out of ragee@vdoe386.vak12ed.edu | me," and ordered a cheeseburger. =============================================================================

is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the ac cycle? a capacitor kludged in somehow, etc? i've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", ac-wise. but there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control of my ssrs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips. my software times out and tries again, but i'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring/redesign. a varistor would help but might not be sufficient. ideas? -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ .......... .. . . . . . university of nebraska - lincoln . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grace . . . . . . . . . . . . happens .

i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components. for those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other. reverse the current and you reverse the effect. i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well. anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks. the biggest device can shift 60w with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour). unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump. i imagine that you would get a back-emf as the temperature gradient across the device increases. if so, presumably its power decreases as the back-emf increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage). if so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it). what i would like to know is: 1: are the above guesses correct? 2: what is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device? (i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when i unplug it) 3: how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work? it looks like magic! 4: why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers? thanks in advance, paul. paul johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).	 | tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245 --------------------------------------------+---------------------------------- these ideas and others like them can be had | gec-marconi research is not for $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions

what's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ? march '93 circuit cellar has part one of an article about dimming 120vac lamps, but it seems to lead into phase- control as the best method for controlling brightness. i've always hated phase-control for the rfi, buzzing filaments and non-linear adjustment range. i had heard that you can modulate the ac line on a cycle by cycle basis to get better results. to cut the lamp's power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of ac, then nothing for another 20 cycles. i wonder if anyone has tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. any advice is appreciated! ken email: sidhu@bode.ee.ualberta.ca

i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is output from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of 100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed more easily into a personal-computer-based adc data acquisition card. might anyone be able to point me to references to such circuits? i have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but i am not sure how well they work in practice. in this case, i'd like something which will amplify sufficiently "nicely" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees accuracy or better). any pointers would be greatly appreciated!

here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there: i bought an 'infrared detector module' at radio shack for $3.95 - it is a little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led. the circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car - all remote commands are relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment. it works fine with my denon cd player, but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friend's vcr, it didn't work. the circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd player... 	any advice would be appreciated.... brian --- ubsiler @ msuvx1.memst.edu

	i have a new scope and i thought i'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in. after having it awhile i noticed two things about the function generator. for one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. that is, i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mv bias. 	the other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1v p-p. i am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and i often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits i build.many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mv amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of kohm range. the thing is, in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. with the 50ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there i have to figure that in. it's kind of a pain in the ass. 	is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. the box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. i could just build a little buffer amp, but i'd like to have this box not be active. 	any quick ideas. the scope's not broken. for other reasons i had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. the function generator was the same way on that one, too. 			please help as i am feeling very stupid 			today, 						dave 						dgj2y@virginia.edu

just a shot here, but ya never know: i once bought a (real) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great. for a while, that is. then one channel quit entirely. i opened it up, and the amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder joints attaching it to the pcb. i soldered them back and it worked fine. i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before. probably lousy heat sinking. you said "a nice alpine" which i'm sure is a few orders of mag higher in quality than the p.o.s. i had. but the point is - look inside before you scrap it, since you occasionally find something you can repair. maybe even the same thing i found. good luck!
i'm no expert at ups's, but you said something that made it sound like you didn't realize something. on a typical ups (well, on ours, anyway), there is no switchover from ac to dc. all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual condition of also having them on charge. if the power fails, big deal - the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it takes a while). if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time? then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast. just keep the dc on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when you "need" it. just some ideas. can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least some of this helped.
i had a ge emerson 13" color tv for about 3 years and one fine day, while we were watching something (i doubt if the program was the cause), we heard a mild explosion. our screen went blank but there was sound, so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'. but soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the tv. the brilliant ees we are, we unplugged the tv and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold, i will transfer u to blah blah.. finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the tv and got a new one (we wanted a bigger one too!). after all the story, what i wanted to know is: is my problem an isolated incident or a common one?

1. can low voltage lights be controlled with an x10 module by putting it before the transformer? it seems to work, even the dimmer works. not very reliable. will it damage the module? can it be done reliably? 2. i put a motion switch (heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is broken, too much current? how can i get arround that? 3. how can i increase the intensity of a light using the x10 pc computer interface without having it go 100% on first and then down. i am doing my own programing, not the x10 program. thanks c. montenegro

the pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me: "a gram of this dye costs a dollar. it comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar. and if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar." i.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct that cost almost nothing intrinsically. -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <><

(red & green wires) i repeated this experiment with the second line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green line.) it also dropped to 31 volts. why is this ? i thought these were separate lines. next i went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco cable. i then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. both lines read open. i'll appreciate any help on this. is this considered normal ? guy urbina urbina@novax.llnl.gov

sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum. this would cause the filament to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure vessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely cracked to begin with) blows off. during the whole sequence of events, the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not losing sound.
	greetings. i've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned 	around oscilliscopes but i'm curious, what does it mean? 	if my life depended on it, i'd say that it's a scope that 	uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive 	taces on the screen for some unit of time - "store" them. 	do i get to live? 	also, i've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope 	since my tek 514a (portable...not!) and my heathkit o-1000 	are all single trace and i need more... like 2 or 3 and at 	least 50mhz (maybe 100...) 	during my shopping at hamfests etc. i've run into the 	problem of "old scope" terminology. i can imagine what 	a "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things like 	the above "storage", "coax input" (hey, where do i get a 	probe that fits this? i had to fiddle with mine for a week 	before i got anything resembling "a good trace" - they all 	come with bnc connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh, 	just like my 514 manuals, many changes were made along the 	way to the schematic - scopes, even with identical model 	numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than 	others - how can i pick the better one? does the rule of the 	higher sn the better apply? 	take care. -- / filip "i'll buy a vowel" gieszczykiewicz. | best e-mail "fmgst+@pitt.edu" \ | all ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond now!!!! | | i live for my ee major, winsurfing, programming, sca, and assorted dreams. | \ 200mb drive - linux has 100mb and ms-dos has 100mb. ms-dos is worried ;-) /

(that's what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed - i got the idea from maxim data sheet.) if you can live with 14 bit resolution, i would recommend looking at the max121 from maxim. it is a high speed (308khz) complete sampling a/d with dsp interface. the input range is +/- 5v and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source) the analog design guide i got from them shows a -100db noise level. they claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) thd. looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces a evaluation kit is available. might want to give these nice folks a call. 1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance. this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software.

(well, almost. there are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.) what you can do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a gfci outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper). in fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a gfci may be *required*. there is a faq on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers. it goes into great detail on these issues (including gfcis) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions. i'll mail a copy to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in the future. 	--- jamie hanrahan, kernel mode systems, san diego ca internet: jeh@cmkrnl.com uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh cis: 74140,2055

(and in 	some parts of canada), canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary 	of the u.s. consequently, the nec does not apply in canada. 	lots of things are the same, including voltages, line 	frequencies, and the laws of physics. but there are a number 	of crucial differences in the regulations. where we can, we've 	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``nec'' or 	``cec''. 	remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards. it is often 	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements. subject: what is the nec? where can i get a copy? 	the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the 	national fire protection association, an insurance industry group. 	it's revised every three years. the 1993 version has been released. 	you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly 	at 800-344-3555. the code exists in several versions. there's the 	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible. there's an abridged 	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. 	and there's the nec handbook, which contains the ``authorized 	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text. that's the 	recommended version. unfortunately, there's no handbook for 	the abridged edition. and the full handbook is expensive -- 	us$65 plus shipping and handling. subject: what is the cec? where can i get a copy? 	the canadian standards association is an organization made up 	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance 	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. 	the csa publishes csa standard c22.1 which is updated every two 	or three years. each province adopts, with some amendments, 	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book. 	since each province publishes its own slightly modified 	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa 	standard itself. in this faq, "cec" really means the 	appropriate provincial standard. in particular, this faq is 	derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code, 20th 	edition (1990). which is in turn based on csa c22.1-1990 (16th 	edition). while differences exist between the provinces, an 	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-ontario detail. 	the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical 	inspection offices of your provincial power authority. in 	ontario, it's ontario hydro. the ontario hydro book isn't 	overly fat. it's about c$25, and includes mailed updates. i 	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the 	equivalent nec publications. 	don't bother asking in quebec - diy wiring is banned throughout 	the province. subject: can i do my own wiring? extra pointers? 	in most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. 	in some, they're not. check with your local electrical 	inspector. most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's 	homes for money without a license. nor are you permitted to do 	wiring in "commercial" buildings. multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) 	are usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial". however, 	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial 	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can 	find one willing to supervise. 	if you do your own wiring, an important point: 	do it neat and well! what you really want to aim for is a better 	job than an electrician will do. after all, it's your own home, 	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make 	a mistake. an electrician has time pressures, has the skills 	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. 	in this faq we've consciously given a few recommendations that 	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, 	and will impress the inspector. 	the inspector will know that you're an amateur. you have to 	earn his trust. the best way of doing this is to spend your 	time doing as neat a job as possible. don't cut corners. 	exceed specifications. otherwise, the inspector may get extremely 	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions. 	don't try to hide anything from the inspector. 	use the proper tools. ie: don't use a bread knife to strip 	wires, or twist wires with your fingers. the inspector 	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe. and it 	takes longer. and you're more likely to stick a hunk of 	12ga wire through your hand that way. 	don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10c 	or 16f). thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types 	become very brittle. subject: what do i need in the way of tools? 	first, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few 	screwdrivers, both straight and phillips-head. if you're 	lucky enough to live in canada (or find a source of csa-approved 	devices) you need robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers 	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips. 	for drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or 	3/8" electric drill will do. if you're doing a lot, or 	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill 	(right-angle drills are wonderful. can be rented) and 	3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits. these bits pull 	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even 	in 90 year old hardwood timbers. 	screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you 	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws 	work well). 	 	for stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or 	ordinary wire cutters. don't buy the $3 k-mart "combo stripper, 	crimper and bottle opener" types. you should expect to pay 	$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair. it will have sized 	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should 	be easy to strip wire with it. one model has a small hole in the 	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals. there 	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't 	necessary, and pros usually don't use them. 	a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends 	in constricted places. don't use these for stripping wire. 	you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts. 	you should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling 	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire 	loops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - more 	accurate. 	if you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for 	removing the sheath. or, do what some pros do, they nick the 	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, 	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a 	"zipper", and cut the sheath off. you shouldn't try to strip 	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to 	slash the insulation on the conductors. apparently stanley 	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) 	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility 	that you'll gouge the conductors. 	for any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well 	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~us$ 18). 	hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire 	or the insulation. 	three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired 	outlets. about $6. multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more 	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people. a simple 	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated 	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost 	about us$ 10 at radio shack. 	you should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are 	dead before doing work on them. neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) 	and work well. if you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type is 	good for tracing circuits without a helper. (though i've been known 	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-) 	for running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. 	often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or 	a length of thin chain will suffice. fish tapes can be rented. 	electrical tape. lots of it ;-) seriously, a good and competent 	wiring job will need very little tape. the tape is useful for 	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work. another use is to wrap 	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination 	screws - i don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to 	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet 	that has no cover plate). subject: what is ul listing? 	the ul stands for "underwriters laboratory". it used to be 	an insurance industry organization, but now it is independent 	and non-profit. it tests electrical components and equipment 	for potential hazards. when something is ul-listed, that means 	that the ul has tested the device, and it meets their requirements 	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard. it doesn't necessarily 	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just 	that it probably won't kill you. 	the ul does not have power of law in the u.s. -- you are 	permitted to buy and install non-ul-listed devices. however, 	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will 	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to 	the failure of a non-ul-listed device. furthermore, in 	many situations the nec will require that a wiring component 	used for a specific purpose is ul-listed for that purpose. 	indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring 	must be ul-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or 	occupancy permits issued. 	 subject: what is csa approval? 	every electrical device or component must be certified by the 	canadian standards association before it can be sold in 	canada. implicit in this is that all wiring must be done 	with csa-approved materials. they perform testing similar to 	the ul (a bit more stringent), except that csa approval is 	required by law. 	again, like the ul, if a fire was caused by non-csa-approved 	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the 	claim. 	in canada, there is a branch organization of the ul, called ulc 	(ul of canada). ulc does not have power of law, and seems to 	be more a liason group between the csa and insurance 	companies. subject: are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring? 	usa: the following three books were suggested by our readers 	 residential wiring 	 by jeff markell, 	 craftsman books, 	 carlsbad ca for $18.25. isbn 0-934041-19-9. 	 practical electrical wiring 	 residential, farm and industrial, based on the national 	 electrical code ansi/nfpa 70 	 herbert p. richter and w. creighton schwan 	 mcgraw-hill book co. 	 wiring simplified 	 h. p. richter and w. c. schwan 	 park publishing co. 	 	try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec 	revision. which is currently 1990. 	canada: p.s. knight authors and publishes a book called 	"electrical code simplified". there appears to be a version 	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the 	appropriate provincial code. it focuses on residential wiring, 	and is indispensible for canadian diy'ers. it is better to get 	this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer 	questions on the net ;-). 	it is updated each time the provincial codes are. this book is 	available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c$10. subject: inspections how and what? why should i get my wiring inspected? 	most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and 	inspections of any wiring that is done. amongst other more 	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not 	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections 	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors 	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose 	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job. 	most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your 	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a 	permit. california, for instance, is particularly nasty about 	this. 	if fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at 	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage 	claims. 	in general, the process goes like this: 		- you apply to your local inspections office or building 		 department for a permit. you should have a sketch or 		 detailed drawing of what you plan on doing. this is 		 a good time to ask questions on any things you're not 		 sure of. if you're doing major work, they may impose 		 special conditions on you, require loading 		 calculations and ask other questions. at this point 		 they will tell you which inspections you will need. 		- if you're installing a main panel, you will need to 		 have the panel and service connections inspected 		 before your power utility will provide a connection. 		 this is sometimes done by the local power authority 		 rather than the usual inspectors. 		- after installing the boxes and wiring, but before 		 the insulation/walls go up, you will need a 		 "rough-in" inspection. 		- after the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, 		 you will need a "final inspection". subject: my house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. 	do i have to upgrade? 	in general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, 	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some 	cases). however, any new work must be done according to the 	latest electrical code. also, if you do ``major'' work, you 	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all 	of your system. check with your local electrical inspector. subject: a word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240 	one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the 	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of 	a circuit. one person might talk about 110v, another 117v 	or another 120v. these are all, in fact, exactly the same 	thing... in north america the utility companies are required 	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. 	this works out as two 120v +- 5% legs. additionally, since there 	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not 	unreasonable to find 120v has dropped to 110v or 240v has dropped 	to 220v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet. especially 	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run. for a number 	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, 	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers. 	this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110v" and 	"220v", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will 	be. confusing? a bit. just ignore it. 	one thing that might make this a little more understandable 	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110v 	instead of 120v) value. what this implies is that the device 	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that 	low. 	208v is *not* the same as 240v. 208v is the voltage between 	phases of a 3-phase "y" circuit that is 120v from neutral to any 	hot. 480v is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "y" 	circuit that's 277v from hot to neutral. 	in keeping with 110v versus 120v strangeness, motors intended 	to run on 480v three phase are often labelled as 440v... subject: what does an electrical service look like? 	there are logically four wires involved with supplying the 	main panel with power. three of them will come from the utility 	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. 	the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where 	the main water pipe entering the house. watch out for galvanic 	action conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)). 	this is the "grounding conductor". it is there to make sure that 	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground. this wire 	normally carries no current. 	one of the other wires will be white (or black with white or 	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black). it is the neutral wire. 	it is connected to the "centre tap" (cec; "center tap" in the 	nec) of the distribution transformer supplying the power. it 	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often 	inside the panel). the neutral and ground should not be connected 	anywhere else. otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen. 	furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in 	a home. some codes require more than one grounding electrode. 	these will be connected together, or connected to the neutral 	at a common point - still one grounding system. adding additional 	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house 	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code. 	if you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually 	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are 	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one 	neutral-ground connection). however, in some situations 	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do 	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your 	inspector. 	the other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot" 	wires. they are attached to the distribution transformer as 	well. 	the two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each 	other. this means if you connect something to both hot wires, 	the voltage will be 220 volts. if you connect something to the 	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110v. 	some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. 	this is either because the neutral and ground are connected 	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one 	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some 	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110v only 	service). subject: what is a circuit? 	inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. 	these connections are then used to supply power to selected 	portions of the home. there are three different combinations: 		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110v circuit. 		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220v circuit. 		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220v circuit + neutral, 		 and/or two 110v circuits with a common neutral. 	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and 	lighting within your house. (3) is usually used for supplying 	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they 	often have need for both 220v and 110v, or for bringing several 	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point. (2) is 	usually for special 220v motor circuits, electric heaters, or 	air conditioners. 	[note: in the us, the nec frequently permits a circuit similar 	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there 	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral 	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing 	the neutral for 110v purposes - three prong plugs instead 	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. 	when connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles 	are required). in our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but 	the nfpa claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 nec, 	and found to be safe. check your local codes, or inquire as to 	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is 	permissible.] 	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, 	white for neutral, and bare for grounding. 	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a 	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral. 	you will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground 	wire. since the white is "hot" in this case, both the nec and cec 	requires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the ends 	to indicate that it is a live wire. usually done with paint, nail 	polish or sometimes electrical tape. 	each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the 	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse. 	there are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) 	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires. some places 	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground", 	the other attaches to the motor). this may or may not be an 	alternative to gfci protection. subject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral". 	according to the terminology in the cec and nec, the 	"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green 	or bare wire. the word "neutral" is reserved for the white when 	you have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire. since the white 	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the 	panel, the proper term is "grounded conductor". however, the 	potential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "grounding 	conductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should 	never use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wire 	as the "grounding conductor", even though they are connected 	together in the panel. 	[but not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground 	separately from the main panel. usually.] 	in the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is used 	for "grounded conductor". this faq uses "neutral" simply to 	avoid potential confusion. we recommend that you use "neutral" 	too. thus the white wire is always (except in some light 	switch applications) neutral. not ground. subject: what does a fuse or breaker do? what are the differences? 	fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power 	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels. for 	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should 	"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting. as 	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the 	wiring -- ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the 	equipment itself won't cause a fire. 	fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt 	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby 	interrupting the power to the circuit. fuses trip relatively 	fast. which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have 	large startup current surges. for motor circuits, you can use 	a "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoid 	tripping on momentary overloads. a fusetron looks like a 	spring-loaded fuse. a fuse can only trip once, then it must be 	replaced. 	breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices. they 	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched 	into position against another contact. when the current flow 	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip 	heats up and bends. by bending it "trips" the latch, and the 	spring pulls the contacts apart. circuit breakers behave 	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to 	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses. with high 	overloads, they trip quickly. breakers can be reset a finite 	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown 	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which 	damages the contacts. thus, breakers should not be used in 	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the 	purpose. 	neither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se. a dead 	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even 	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which 	can often cause severe damage. subject: breakers? can't i use fuses? 	statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher 	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels. this is usually 	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts 	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse 	being installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with a 	penny" trick. 	since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better 	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less. 	fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload. when 	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting 	path. result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, 	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical 	distribution transformer and having your house burn down. 	breakers don't do this. 	many jurisdictions, particularly in canada, no longer permit 	fuse panels in new installations. the nec does permit new 	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special 	inserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses) 	some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse 	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel. the fuse 	is there to protect the motor windings from overload. check the 	labeling on the unit. this is usually only on large permanently 	installed motors. the installation instructions will tell you 	if you need one. subject: what size wire should i use? 	for a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire. for a 15 amp circuit, 	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales). for a long run, 	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid 	voltage drops. 12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with. 	here's a quick table for normal situations. go up a size for 	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or 	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate 	heat easily: 		gauge		amps 		14		15 		12		20 		10		30 		8		40 		6		65 	 	we don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent 	on the application and precise wire type. subject: where do these numbers come from? 	there are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. 	the smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is. when 	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is 	more voltage drop in the wiring. the former is why you need 	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in 	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long 	runs. 	neither effect is very significant over very short distances. 	there are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller 	wire is allowed. the obvious one is the line cord on most 	lamps. don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits 	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger 	wire. subject: what does "14-2" mean? 	this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors 	in a cable. the first number specifies the gauge. the second 	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but 	remember there's usually an extra ground wire. "14-2" means 	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground. 	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire. sometimes 	the white is red instead for 220v circuits without neutral. in 	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too. 	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. 	usually carrying 220v with neutral. subject: what is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"? how are they 	used? 	a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used 	to connect wires together. "marrette" or "marr connector" 	are trade names. you'll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring. 	in essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them 	together, then twist the wirenut on. 	though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the 	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically 	secure. 	there are many different sizes of wire nut. you should check 	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the 	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together. 	don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or 	your fingers. use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers, 	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly. sometimes 	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it 	goes in the wirenut properly. 	some people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electrical 	tape. this is probably not a good idea - the inspector may 	tear it off during an inspection. it's usually done because 	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead 	of taping it, the connection should be redone. subject: what is a gfi/gfci? 	a gfci is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''. it measures 	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the 	neutral wire. if they differ by more than a few milliamps, the 	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other 	path. this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of 	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person. any 	of these situations is hazardous, so the gfci trips, breaking 	the circuit. 	gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks. if, 	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral 	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a gfci 	wouldn't help. all of the current that passed from the hot 	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the 	gfci happy. 	the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric. 	one is labeled load; the other, line. the incoming power feed 	*must* be connected to the line side, or the outlet will not be 	protected. the load side can be used to protect all devices 	downstream from it. thus, a whole string of outlets can be 	covered by a single gfci outlet. subject: where should gfcis be used? 	the nec mandates gfcis for 110v, 15a or 20a single phase 	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, 	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or 	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water 	or dampness. there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, 	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', 	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and 	laundry appliances. 	the cec does not mandate as many gfcis. in particular, there 	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or 	basement outlets. basement outlets must be protected if you 	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to 	outside. bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis. 	even if you are not required to have gfci protection, you may 	want to consider installing it anyway. unless you need a gfci 	breaker (see below), the cost is low. in the u.s., gfci 	outlets can cost as little as us$8. (costs are a bit higher in 	canada: c$12.) evaluate your own risk factors. does your 	finished basement ever get wet? do you have small children? 	do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools? does 	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage? subject: where shouldn't i use a gfci? 	gfcis are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a 	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run 	unattended for long periods of time. refrigerators, freezers, 	and sump pumps are good examples. the rationale is that gfcis 	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips. some people claim that 	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary 	current imbalance, tripping the gfci. note, though, that most 	gfci trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no 	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring 	before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless. subject: what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker? 	for most situations, you can use either a gfci outlet as the 	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with 	a built-in gfci. the former is generally preferred, since gfci 	breakers are quite expensive. for example, an ordinary ge 	breaker costs ~us$5; the gfci model costs ~us$35. there is one 	major exception: if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch 	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), 	such as a canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a 	multi-pole gfci breaker. unfortunately, these are expensive; 	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on 	what brand of panel box you have. but if you must protect such 	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice. 	one more caveat -- gfci outlets are bulky. you may want to use 	an oversize box when installing them. on second thought, use 	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere. you'll thank yourself for it. 	incidentally, if you're installing a gfci to ensure that one 	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't 	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first 	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet 	in the bathroom, and not gfci anything upstream of it. but 	protecting the whole circuit is preferred. 	when you install a gfci, it's a good idea to use the little 	"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and mark 	the outlets downstream of the gfci. you can figure out which 	outlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the gfci with the 	test button and see which outlets are dead. subject: what's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then? 	apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, 	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without 	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against 	insulation failures within the device. generally, the case of 	the appliance is connected to the ground lead. if there's an 	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the 	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly 	trips the circuit breaker in the process). if the case is not 	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if 	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped. of 	course, if the circuit is gfci-protected, it will be a very 	tiny zap -- which is why you can use gfcis to replace 	ungrounded outlets (both nec and cec). 	there are some appliances that should *never* be grounded. in 	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with 	exposed conductors. consider: if you touch the heating 	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will 	happen. if you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; 	the resistance will be too high. but if the case were 	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to 	ground... subject: why is one prong wider than the other? polarization 	nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the 	other. this is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) 	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. 	this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the 	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to 	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios). 	most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too. 	this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right 	way around. you want the wide prong to be neutral, and the 	narrow one hot. most outlets have a darker metal for the 	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. 	if not, you can usually figure out which is which by which 	prong the terminating screw connects to. subject: what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen? 	the nec requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance 	circuits'' for kitchens. the cec requires split-duplex 	receptacles. outlets must be installed such that no point is more 	than 24" (nec) (900 mm cec) from an outlet. every counter wider 	than 12" (nec) or 300 mm (cec) must have at least one outlet. 	the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except 	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room. furthermore, these circuits 	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, 	lighting, etc. non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be 	protected by a gfci (nec only). 	split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220v circuit. the tab 	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to 	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. 	the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw. when 	"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must be 	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral 	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect 	from downstream outlets. subject: where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms? 	there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to 	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in 	the light fixture. all such outlets *must* be gfci-protected. subject: what is romex/nm/nmd? what is bx? when should i use each? 	romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. 	sometimes called non-metallic sheath. the formal name is nm. 	this is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside 	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject 	to mechanical damage or excessive heat. most newer homes are 	wired almost exclusively with nm wire. there are several 	different categories of nm cable. 	bx cable -- technically known as armored cable or "ac" has a 	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is 	fairly resistant to damage. 	teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic 	sheath. 	 	protection for cable in concealed locations: where nm or ac cable 	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer 	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (cec & nec) 	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected 	from mechanical injury. this latter protection can take the form of 	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit. 	[note: inspector-permitted practise in canada suggests that armored 	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, 	but this is technically illegal.] 	additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the 	canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague 	references to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the nec 	and cec): 	 - nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage 	 where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls 	 in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. 	 ie: use ac instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. 	 - where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces 	 or water heaters, the wire should be protected. canadian 	 practise is usually to install a junction or outlet 	 box on the wall, and use a short length of ac cable 	 or nm cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance. 	 stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. 	 - where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating 	 ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by 	 means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation 	 material (a wad of fiberglass). 	 - nm cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box 	 or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. 	 holes in joists or studs are considered "supports". 	 some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to 	 each box. [while fishing cable is technically in violation, 	 it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical] 	 - 2 conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge. 	 [knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring 	 to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured 	 in the breach...] 	 - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or 	 similar finish. 	 - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. 	 - cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists 	 or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more 	 than 1m (39"). 	whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small 	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to 	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through 	the insulation. 	bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by 	solid wall coverings. 	in places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of 	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a 	ul- (or csa-) approved metal pipe. you use various types of 	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the 	wire. 	service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit. 	in damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will 	need special wire (eg: cec nmw90, nec uf). nmw90 looks like 	very heavy-duty nmd90. you will usually need short lengths of 	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground. [see underground 	wiring section.] 	thermoplastic sheath wire (such as nm, nmw etc.) should not be 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that 	purpose. 	many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through 	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed 	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces. the reason for this 	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses 	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building. 	teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. 	 	canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us, 	except that canadian wire designations usually include the 	temperature rating in celsius. eg: "ac90" versus "ac". 	in the us, nm-b is 90 degrees celcius. 	note: local codes vary. this is one of the items that changes 	most often. eg: chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. 	there are very different requirements for mobile homes. 	check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything 	that's the slightest out of the ordinary. 	wire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, 	uncommon wire types or applications omitted) 	condition			type	cec	nec 	exposed/concealed dry		plastic	nmd90	nm 					armor	ac90	ac 						teck90 	exposed/concealed damp		plastic	nmd90	nmc 					armor	acwu90 						teck90 	exposed/concealed wet		plastic	nmwu90 					armor	acwu90 						teck90 	 	exposed to weather		plastic	nmwu 						tw etc. 					armor	teck90 	 	direct earth burial/		plastic	nmwu*	uf 	service entrance			rwu 						twu 					armor	ra90 						teck90 						acwu90 	[* nmwu not for service entrance] subject: should i use plastic or metal boxes? 	the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable 	only. the reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box 	itself provides ground conductor continuity. u.s. plastic 	boxes don't use metal cable clamps. 	the cec is slightly different. the cec never permits cable 	armor as a grounding conductor. however, you must still 	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath. the cec also 	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes. 	the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for 	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground 	connection and they sometimes cost a little less. on the other 	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts. for 	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better. subject: junction box positioning? 	a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together. 	junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible 	later. ie: not buried under plaster. excessive use of junction 	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may 	get nasty. subject: can i install a replacement light fixture? 	in general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few 	caveats. first, of course, one should check the amperage 	rating of the circuit. if your heart is set on installing half 	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire 	back to the panel box. but there are some more subtle 	constraints as well. for example, older house 	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation. the excess 	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the 	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. 	some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high 	temperature wire only. (you may find, in fact, that your 	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case 	replacing any devices is a real adventure.) 	other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some 	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and 	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy 	chandelier or ceiling fan. you may need to install a new box 	specifically listed for this purpose. a 2x4 across the ceiling 	joists makes a good support. metal brackets are also available 	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and 	mounted between the joists. 	there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as 	"pot" lamps or heat lamps. when these are installed in insulated 	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. 	the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated 	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually 	8'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and covering 	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation. (yes, that's 8 *feet* 	long) 	nec rules are somewhat less stringent. they require at least 3" 	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. 	the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, 	which means that a cec-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. 	presumably, that's up to the local inspector. [the cec doesn't 	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector 	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get 	accidentally buried in insulation. ie: if you have insulation blown 	in later.] 	there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and 	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation. they are 	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat 	more expensive than the older types. before you use them, you should 	ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses. 	follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location 	for the sensor can vary. 	there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved 	for use in insulation. the "coffin" appears the only legal approach. subject: what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts? 	this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is 	loose. depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up 	being more than 110v, and the other less than 110v, with 	respect to ground. this is a very hazardous situation - it can 	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in 	some situations electrocute you (ie: some us jurisdictions 	require the stove frame connected to neutral). 	if this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately 	and have them come and check out the problem. 	note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with 	lighting and motors on the same 220v with neutral circuit. a 	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness 	far longer than one second. in case of doubt, get help. subject: what is 3 phase power? should i use it? can i get it in my house? 	three phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out of 	phase with each other. these are usually used for large motors 	because it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque, 	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper. 	you're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between 	any two hots. the latter shows the difference between a normal 	220v/110v common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the 	two hots. there are 3 phase circuits with different voltages. 	bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually 	ridiculously expensive, or impossible. if the equipment you 	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *much* cheaper to 	buy a new 110v or 220v motor for it. in some cases it is 	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have 	a "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a 	(auto-)generator. these are tricky, but are a good solution if 	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to 	replace. the taunton press book ``the small shop'' has an 	article on how to do this if you must. 	note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using 	such a converter. the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that. subject: is it better to run motors at 110 or 220? 	theoretically, it doesn't make any difference. however, there 	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply 	wiring. all things being equal, a 220v motor will lose 4 times 	less power in the house wiring than a 110v motor. this also 	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor 	will get to speed quicker. and in some circumstances, the 	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life. 	this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more 	than 50 feet long. subject: what is this nonsense about 3hp on 110v 15a circuits? 	it is a universal physical law that 1 hp is equal to 746 	watts. given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, 	it is usually best to consider 1 hp is going to need 1000-1200 	watts. a 110v 15a circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, 	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 hp. given rational 	efficiency factors, 1.5hp is more like it. 	some equipment manufacturers (sears in particular, most router 	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a hp rating that is far 	in excess of what is possible. they are giving you a "stall 	horsepower" or similar. that means the power is measured when 	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. 	what they don't mention is that if you kept it in that 	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker 	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far 	more current than it can continuously. 	when comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower. this 	should be on the motor nameplate. if you can't find that figure, 	check the amperage rating, which is always present. subject: how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong? 	older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead 	of the more modern three. these receptacles have no safety 	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire. neither 	the nec or cec permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore. 	there are several different approaches to solving this: 	 1) if the wiring is done through conduit or bx, and the 	 conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect 	 the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle 	 box. nec mainly - cec frowns on this practise. 	 2) if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and 	 it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can 	 run a conductor to it from the third prong. 	 3) run a ground conductor back to the main panel. 	 4) easiest: install a gfci receptacle. the ground lug 	 should not be connected to anything, but the gfci 	 protection itself will serve instead. the gfci 	 will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong 	 outlets). if you do this to protect downstream outlets, 	 the grounds must not be connected together. since it 	 wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault 	 could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected 	 to other outlets. be sure, though, that there aren't 	 indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath 	 on bx cable. 	the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three 	prong if you fill the u ground with a non-conducting goop. 	like caulking compound. this is not permitted in the nec. subject: are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets? 	should the test button work? 	we're sure about what the nec and cec say. remember, though, 	that your local codes may vary. as for the test button -- there's 	a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line 	side of the neutral wire when you press the test button. current 	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the gfci. 	this is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require 	a real ground to work. if your gfci does not trip when you press 	the test button, it is very probably defective or miswired. again: 	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially 	dangerous. the problem should be corrected immediately. 	the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground 	wire must be connected. we do not know why they say this. the 	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the 	formalities of ul or csa listing -- perhaps the device was never 	tested without the ground wire being connected. on the other hand, 	ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device 	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded 	outlet replacement. (one of us called leviton; their gfcis are 	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only. the technician 	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the nec does not require 	it, and promised to investigate.) subject: how should i wire my shop? 	as with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all 	devices that will be on simultaneously. the code specifies 	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the 	circuit. for typical home shop use, this means one circuit for 	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or 	shop vac. use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have 	big motors, with a big start-up surge. if you can, use 20 amp 	breakers (nec), though cec requires standard 20a receptacles 	which means you'd have to "replug" all your equipment. lights 	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared 	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two 	separate circuits. the idea is that you want to avoid a 	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand 	rpm, while you're groping in the dark for the off switch. 	do install lots of outlets. it's easier to install them in the 	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. 	it's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each 	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same 	time as the tool you really want. but use metal boxes and 	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have 	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit 	wrong. 	note that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring" 	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used 	for working. what this means is that all wiring must be 	run along structural members. ie: stapled to studs. 	other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220v 	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. 	don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you 	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents. (a coiled 	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of 	the same gauge. also, the insulation won't withstand as much 	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.) 	if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, 	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop 	wiring from it. if you have young children, you may want to 	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. 	if you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' 	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. 	for example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to 	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw. buy 	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead. 	finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished 	basements; hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply. and 	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop 	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might 	have a different idea. 	note: fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop 	wiring. april 1992 is one place to start. subject: underground wiring 	you will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use 	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic 	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots 	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion 	of lead). the transition from in-house to underground wire is 	generally via conduit. all outdoor boxes must be specifically 	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, 	fittings, etc. if the location of the box is subject to immersion 	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed. and 	of course, don't forget the gfcis. 	the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to 	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about 	your specific situation. 	a hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried power 	line" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed. subject: aluminum wiring 	during the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became 	quite popular and was extensively used. since that time, 	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, 	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. 	we recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new 	wiring. 	but don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring. aluminum 	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. 	aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper 	installation. we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential 	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe. 	the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as 	"cold creep". when aluminum wiring warms up, it expands. when 	it cools down, it contracts. unlike copper, when aluminum goes 	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each 	time. to make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes 	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance 	of the connection goes up. which causes it to heat up and corrode/ 	oxidize still more. eventually the wire may start getting very hot, 	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even 	cause a fire. 	since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move 	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of 	safe aluminum wiring. we suggest that, if you're considering purchasing 	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you 	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring 	for the following things: 	 1) fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to 	 aluminum wiring should be rated for it. the device will 	 be stamped with "al/cu" or "co/alr". the latter supersedes 	 the former, but both are safe. these fixtures are somewhat 	 more expensive than the ordinary ones. 	 2) wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around 	 the screw in a clockwise direction). connections should be 	 tight. while repeated tightening of the screws can make the 	 problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug 	 up each connection. 	 note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the 	 main service entrance cable. it should be inspected. 	 3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. 	 any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with 	 the proper screw connections immediately. 	 4) there should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, 	 melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures. any such damage should 	 be repaired. 	 	 5) connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be 	 handled specially. current canadian codes require that the 	 wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting 	 aluminum to copper. the nec requires that the wire be 	 connected together using special crimp devices, with an 	 anti-oxidant grease. the tools and materials for the latter 	 are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless 	 you can rent the tool. 	 6) any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring 	 by means of a short copper "pigtail". see (5) above. 	 	 7) shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped 	 (not nicked) wire etc. 	if, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring 	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider 	the wiring safe. if there are signs of problems in many places, 	we suggest you look elsewhere. if the wrong receptacles are used, 	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having 	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. 	you can do this yourself too. subject: i'm buying a house! what should i do? 	congratulations. but... it's generally a good idea to hire 	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. 	not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well. if an 	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor 	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any 	minor problems are fixed). if there are signs of problems in many 	places, we suggest you look elsewhere. 	here's some hints on what to look for: 	obvious non-code wiring can include: 		- zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls 		- hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without 		 proper marking. 		- ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of 		 a gfci) 		- splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) 		- switched neutrals 		- unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines 	certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one 	time) sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations: 		- switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps 		 not properly terminated wiring) 		- a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are 		 separately controlled by other wall switches. (except when 		 it's *really* convenient ;-) 		- switches and outlets in bizarre locations 		- great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps 		- junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them 		- wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or 		 ceiling 		- backwrapped grounding wires subject: what is this weird stuff? old style wiring 	 	in the years since edison "invented" electricity, several different 	wiring "styles" have come and gone. when you buy an older home you 	may encounter some of this stuff. this section describes the old 	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies. 	the oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called 	"knob and tube" (k&t). it is made up of individual conductors with 	a cloth insulation. the wires are run along side structural 	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). 	wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes. connections 	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping 	with tape. since the hot and neutral were run separately, 	the wiring tends to be rather confusing. a neutral often runs 	down the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture. 	the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next. in some 	cases k&t isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same 	colour as the hot wires. 	you'll see k&t in homes built as late as the 40's. 	comments on k&t: 		- the people installing k&t were pretty paranoid about 		 electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. 		- the wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up 		 very well. most k&t i've seen, for example, is in 		 quite good condition. 		- no grounding. grounding is usually difficult to install. 		- boxes are small. receptacle replacement (particularly with 		 gfci) can be difficult. no bushing on boxes either, 		 so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. 		- sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between 		 separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to 		 overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on 		 any circuit. 		- building code does not permit insulation in walls 		 that contain k&t. 		- connection to existing k&t from new circuits can be 		 tricky. consult your inspector. 		- modern wiring practise requires considerably more 		 outlets to be installed than k&t systems did. 	 	since k&t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't 	necessary to replace it simply because it's k&t. what you should 	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and 	be cautious about circuit loading. in many cases it's perfectly 	reasonable to leave existing k&t alone, and add new fixtures on 	new circuits using modern techniques. 	 	after k&t, they invented multi-conductor cable. the first type 	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation. it looks 	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two. this stuff was 	used in the 40's and 50's. again, no grounding conductor. 	it was installed much like modern wiring. its major drawback 	is that this type of insulation embrittles. we've seen whole 	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at 	a touch. bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems. 	this stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if 	the wires become bare. this wiring should be left untouched as 	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. 	a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several 	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink 	tubing. 	after this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. 	it's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth. often a bit sticky. 	this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard 	and is reasonably easy to work with. it does not need to be 	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff - 	thermoplastic insulation wire. just don't abuse it too much. subject: where do i buy stuff? 	try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you. their 	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or 	diy centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety 	including the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter that 	know what you're talking about. cultivate friendly knowledgeable 	sales people. they'll give you much valuable information. -- chris lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; phone: canada 613 832-0541 psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca

i was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a simple way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel). i need it to accept line inputs (tape deck, cd player, etc.) and output to the same! so input impedance should equal output impedance. also, since i am driving a line, i would need 1 volt p-p output. final requirement is that i can either: 	 1. control it digitally 			or 	 2. control it easily, or with few resistors finally - if anyone knows of any filter or equalizer chips, that might be useful, please let me know.

dear netters i want to send emg-signals from a running person to a computer. each signal is 4khz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each running person. the signal is only to be sent over a few hundred meters. it seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is about 150mhz and about 440mhz. to make the transmitters as light as possible i suppose it will be best the to send the signals in an analog form. as this application is rather specialized i do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter- units i need. on the other hand i imagine that i can buy the receiver somewhere. i need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers as needed in the particular case. do anybody know if there is existing such receiver system on the market? baldur@rsp.is (tf3bp) (please respond by email rather than nn)

i missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a chance to read the news for a couple of days... the idea is commercialized in at least one product, the private eye. that's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band. there is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye. the private eye we had here for evaluation was hercules-mda compatible. the innards are a row (~400 leds) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement. the result is that the sweeping led bar forms a fused raster. there is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background. i didn't like the device very much. i found it easiest to use if i looked at a blank white wall. i had problems with focus tracking if i glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key. the unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which i found annoying. some people didn't seem to mind the buzz. properly used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp. i don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

i have an adcom gfa-555 that i got in 1985. there certainly isn't anything magic about it. the components used are decent, but nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components. the gfa-555 is a nice piece of equipment. i'm glad that adcom had the guts to not over-do the packaging. it irks me when i see audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they are supposed to serve. i don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which something is assembled. this is especially true for something as low-technology as a gfa-555. i'd hope that a gfa-545 would still work well after several years. except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to go wrong. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

if the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt supply. several sets i've looked at use a 135 volt regulator. the regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits shut down the eht supply section. try putting the set on a variac or adjustable transformer and lower the ac input voltage to the set to about 90 volts. if the set operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator. there are myriad other areas for problems, but i've seen the one above several times. also, if the set uses one, the trippler module may be shot; that's fairly common. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed
does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the edges of my computer screen? the growth has been gradual so i don't know how long it's taken to get this bad. i have a 19" dec (?) color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1 inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and negligible at the top of the screen. the only controls are brightness knob, contrast knob, degauss switch, and power switch. is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered? larry hsu larryhsu@mtl.mit.edu
1) output offset: obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl. there is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position. 2) verify that the function generator is properly loaded. many generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load. go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm terminator that has a male and female bnc (or whatever) connector on it. the calibrator on my tektronix scope is designed to put out .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load. you may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion. build an attenuator. you don't have to use (and i wouldn't want to use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage. consider this: ------10k--------+---------? ohm ---- | gen 50 ohm d.u.t. (loaded) | -----------------+------------------- think about the ratio of 50/10k and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope. you can virtually discount the loading of the d.u.t. also you have the millivolt test generator you want. good luck, -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed
hi, 	i am looking for some help in choosing a package for a high-speed silicon adc (100mhz) currently being fabricated. this is a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb. i expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do dc, low-speed and high-speed testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip. 	 	i know for sure that a dip will not work (the long lead lines have too high an inductance). getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier. the flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and i would spend loads of time soldering as i kept changing the test chip. the leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds. 	does anyone out there have experience/knowledge of this field ? i would greatly appreciate help! any ideas/ names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages would help. p.s. the multi-layer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit of overkill(?) 	 --- seema varma

one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate. if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 10khz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 hz per channel sampling rate.) that level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish. combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation. a system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced. a commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth. obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

we have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. we would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings. the three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction. to further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars a,b,c 5 ms apart each other. we should normally see an echo on a that corresponds to the distance. however, sonar a detects the init line of sonar b! the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a; we can see a very faint 50khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the time the init line of sonar b is activated. we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference. we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars b and c. has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and this type of experience? your suggestions for remedies will be greatly appreciated. -- caglan m. aras [] aras@eceris.ece.ncsu.edu ece department [] ph: 919-515-5405 north carolina state university[] fx: 919-515-5523 raleigh, nc 27695 []

(i'd do 2 oz at about 0.08" width myself, i think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition.) (there's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough? but you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or just the resistivity of copper. keep traces short and use separate sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

hello, i just canceled my support of the cable regime and i would like to at least pick up the 3 networks and nbc. :) i do not have tons of money nor even a few pounds so what i am looking for is the best solution for reception for under 100 dollars. i have seen modules that you plug into your wall outlet that "supposedly" make your entire house an antenna. i have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for "excellent reception" at best. i'll try anything, though, if it works. i am in a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations which are pretty large (montgomery alabama pop. 200,000) and colombus goergia, pop. 100,000+. any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)? thank you in advance. paul sylvester shanley pshanley@humsci.auburn.edu voice 205 887 7440

there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here. a few points need to be clarified: the equipment grounding conductor, green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects. it should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load. some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor. much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation ("orange" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service. anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems. the code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod) many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. the grounded conductor of a circuit, often called the neutral, which is referred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey. this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel. this connection is through the main bonding jumper. (in many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel) the grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor. in the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device. since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions. if you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor. since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end. if the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "u" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. the difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two. this normally does not present a shock hazard. however, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path. if the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire. it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat. with the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire. also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction. i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment. the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling. this is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly. the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer. some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground. there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame me on this, i'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as i'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.) note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, not at any sub distribution panels. this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral. the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor. if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above. the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another. in the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire. every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. these exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before u ground outlets and such. the appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances. no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. so far, the exceptions have survived. in the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection. people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor. obviously, the bare wire in "romex" 'with ground' is. anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor. the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the us). (bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath. you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath.) conduit or emt (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes. "greenfield" (looks like big bx, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is not a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance. you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield. "wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box. i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with 120 volts (why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box. you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, bx, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever. on another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available. it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it. the interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip. it is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path. for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi's, read in the nec, 210-7 (d) exception. (this is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but i know the rule hasn't changed. it might be renumbered though.) we have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now. john -- ******************************************************************************* john h. schmidt, p.e. |internet: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.edu technical director, wbau |phone--days (212)456-4218 adelphi university | evenings (516)877-6400 garden city, new york 11530 |fax-------------(212)456-2424 *******************************************************************************

	this is a followup post to something i've written previously. several people responded with good information, but i don't think i communicated exactly what i am looking for. 	i'm working on a custom i/o device that will communicate with a host via rs-232. my custom circuitry will use an 80c186eb or ec cpu and require about 64k of ram (preferably flash ram). in looking around, i see that lots of people have engineered uart-cpu-rom-ram subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom i/o devices. it's been done so much, that it would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system. it just needs to use an 80c186 (or 188) cpu, and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program. well, there's one other thing the rom needs to know how to do. it should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (dtr,rts,dts,cts). everything i've seen is in the $200.00 and up range. that's too much for this application. i need something around $100.00. the cpu has the uart built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips. does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain circuitry i can use? thanks in advance for the info. rich

recently i posted two oscilliscopes for sale. one has sold, the other is still available: used, good condition: hitachi v-422 40mhz dual-channel portable analog oscilliscope o 1mv/div o dc offset o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified waveform) o vert mode trigger o tv sync separation circuit list price $910.00 (...and the price fry's electronics just quoted!) :-( sells for $699.99 (jdr microdevices current price) $745.95 (products international) your price used $425.00 obo ...i haven't gotten an offer at the asking price, so 'obo' applies... i also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold: jdr 2000 20mhz dual-channel portable analog oscilliscope o 5mv/div o component tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils) o tv video sync filter o z-axis input (intensity modulation) 'broken' means: the crt produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does not correspond to the input signal. my guess is it's repairable but more than a simple calibration problem...but i honestly have not tried to calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. it's 'as-is'. i paid $60 for it in its current state (i bought it thinking i'd repair it, using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since i've sold the 'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and i'd like to recoup that amount. as above, i'll accept offers and take the best one. i'd prefer a local (bay area, california) buyer, so (a) i don't have to ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase. rbn@apple.com

(there's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology). so it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible. hence big cooling towers. oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient. some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one canadian official, asked about "thermal pollution" de-icing a river, said, "up here, we view heat as a resource". everybody runs closed-cycle boilers. the water used is purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils. purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled. 					john nagle

i recently bought an apparantly complete expansion chassis by mountain computer inc. it consists of a box with 8 apple ][+ compatible slots, powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer to be expanded. there was also included a small card with empty sockets on top and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard somewhere after pulling a chip. there's an empty socket also on the interface card and a short 16-pin dip jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards. this technological marvel came with no docs and i haven't a clue as how to hook this thing up. if anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this i could really use copies of them or at least some help. i need to know: o how to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis. o how to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card and if the small card is used. o the purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more of those than my cms scsi card!) thanks john daniels ah499@cleveland.freenet.edu

on an a/d board i've got, i'm using the a/d lines. it measures the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 5v, it reg's 5v. problem is when i've got the input voltage, and i wish to lower it via a resistor. the sensitivity of the board is so great that i can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch the probe and it will register the full input voltage. a 1m resistor only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. what could the problems be and what else could i use to lower the input voltage?

the object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile. a side effect of this deficit-reduction program is that they provide a low-t reservoir for a variety of industrial processes. now you know. -- john berryhill

i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise. i have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that i am using (analogic 2020) has some relatively large common mode noise on it. i am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uv) several hundred times. the 2020 has about 1-3 mvp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat. (the noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64hz). how can i get rid of the noise? when i look at the spectrum using an hp 3582a (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute i switch to 'isolation' on the input. i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to dc. also, if i use a differential amplifier (ia) to solve the problem, how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances)? if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for use with transient signals with content from 1khz to about 300khz, i would appreciate it.

just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles on your electronic odometer with an oscillator.... i wouldn't expect to be able to do this. not because the engineers at bmw are putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile environment for electronics, and i would expect the software to be conservative. if i were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program, it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ): * debouncing/deglitching ( is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? ) * smoothing: the rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high: this is a car, not an electron. * top speed limit: anything above 200mph is ridiculous: must be electrical noise or contact bounce as for getting in and presetting the pins: if this is the circuit board out of a bmw dashboard, i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card. good luck getting at the counter :-). i wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter: remember, it's probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected. after all, a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics; there used to be an app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that went into this in good detail. - jerry kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com ) - jerry kaidor

hi, i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related subjects. i am currently learning about am/fm receivers and recieving circuits. i understand a lot of things ,but a few things i am confused abuot. the first is the mixer, to mix the rf and local oscillator frequencies to make the if. does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? i have come across a mc-sbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs (active,etc...) along the same note, are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?. p.s. any really good books on am/fm theory along with detailed electrical diagrams would help a lot. i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help. 				thanks, 				mark musone
i am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an led illuminator driven with pulse-width modulation. i'm using the 8751, and i understand that the -fb version has a programmable counter array that can essentially be set and forgotten to do the pwm. the problems is, that variant is difficult to come by. i need two or three of the d prefix (ceramic window) version for development, and then lots of the p prefix (plastic otp) for later production. i've tried avnet, arrow, and pioneer. they (might) have them, but i'm looking for samples at this point, and they're not too willing to provide them. i would buy them, but these vendors have $100.00 minimums. any help is appreciated. ================================================================================ [ mark e. levy, fermilab | ] [ bitnet: levy@fnal | unix is to computing ] [ internet: levy@fnald.fnal.gov | as an etch-a-sketch is to art. ] [ hepnet/span: fnald::levy (vms!) | ] ================================================================================

i am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from a mc146818a real time clock. has anyone out there had some experience in doing this? the specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but i thought that i had it worked out. however, with a 32khz crystal the lowest current drain i can acheive at 3.7v vcc is 150ua. this is three times the specified maximum under the conditions i am attempting to create. i have done the following things: 1) made sure that reset/ is asserted for trlh after powerup, and as is low during this time. 2) made sure that there is a cycle on as after the negation of rd/ or wr/ during which stby/ was asserted. what am i doing wrong? thanks very much, martin.

the fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'smd' interface (storage module device?). a lot of older minis used it. sun still does on their server models. there are several different speeds of smd, and i think that the fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 mb/sec (thats megabits). there used to be several companies that made couplers for the pc (interphase in texas being one), but i think that the market pretty much has dried up. controllers for this type of drive are readily available for vme buses though. rumor has it that there is a smd to scsi adapter available, but i think that it was designed for slower smd devices. in other words, if you have a pc or mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. cheers, corwin
currently i am using the 8051 microcontroller with external eprom.. in order to drive the dc motor (with direction) i use the pulse width modultion thru software control(assembly language programming). however i am afraid that they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing. my question is is the software pwm control reliable?. i understand that port 0 is a latch and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire duty cycle then i set low..? any improments ?

hi all, i'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus. i'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up. our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function. we already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 vac) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second. i've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12v relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit. low tech and simple, but there's one problem: in order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film. (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!) ideally, i would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) this would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second. the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice. i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort. i'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads. any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated! thanks, mark fontana -- "of all the arts, the cinema is | mark a. fontana the most important." | computer and information science --v.i. lenin | the ohio state university

you can get a *little* uv by putting a heavy uv filter (deep purple) in front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get). my father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964. good uv ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs. i'd proceed by getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an electrical supply house and finding a uv bulb that would fit it. -- :- michael a. covington, associate research scientist : ***** :- artificial intelligence programs mcovingt@ai.uga.edu : ********* :- the university of georgia phone 706 542-0358 : * * * :- athens, georgia 30602-7415 u.s.a. amateur radio n4tmi : ** *** ** <><
i had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch, to put both machines on one line. you order distinctive ringing from your phone company. this is $3/month here. you get a second (unpublished) phone number. when someone calls this number, your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings. you set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings. you'd give out the new # as your fax #. a device would measure the length of rings. when it detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine. five rings later your fax picks up the call. this should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available. but that's not what i did. i'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers. this should leave the old # for telemarketers, etc. i won't pick up the phone when i hear the long rings. -- "why my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they are out they are another's." - susannah martin, hanged for witchcraft, 1692. thomas david kehoe kehoe@netcom.com (408) 354-5926

i've had my fluke 8060a here at work for just over 10 years now. it is a wonderful meter. several colleagues here have some of the newer fluke meters, though i still would just as soon hang on to my 8060. the 8060 a is the 1980s digial "analog" to the simpson 260 analog dmm of the 1950-1960s. there was/is (?) an 8060b that had extended frequency response. i've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by soar that i keep in my toolbox at home. i've had that for six or seven years now and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than adequate for day-to-day hobby use. i think soar oems their stuff for a number of vendors. some of jdr microdevices' stuff looks rather similar to soar's. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed
yes, you increase the rpm slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply. the air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uf capacitor. use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts. note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application. for dc powered applications, try the radio shack 12 volt box fan. it can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 vdc. it is exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow. i wish i knew who made the fans for radio shack. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use. jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not. a lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding. when you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. (i promise i am not making this up!) i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets. mike coyne

i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (vs. a blank screen) by monitoring the r,g, and b outputs of a graphics card. it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 mhz, which would mean detecting a 15 ns pulse. it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv). oh yes, it also needs to be cheap. my first circuit was a dismal failure. i used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer). the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so i could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it. the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen. in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv. i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work. there are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require split supplies. i would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit. at this point, i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit. transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick... unfortunately, i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits, so i am appealing to the net for help. any ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated. oh yes, i only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so i don't need a fast response time at all, however, i haven't found a way to take advantage of that fact. thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. of course, you will have my undying gratitude. steve verity -- ..........>.........>........>......>...>...>..>..>..>..>.>.>.>>>>>>>>+ . steve verity + + ...maxed on midi + . + verity@jack.sns.com + .. +

(i'm sure you can figure out now just what "far uv" is.) regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source. stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor). be careful, though; strong uv sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes. the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous. it wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source. it would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so. 		-ed hall 		edhall@rand.org

this may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time i've ever had a need for this: i've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic high, etc.). anyway, i've got some servos lying around, and i wanted to do some things with them using digital logic. i know all about having to pulse the signal and everything, i just have one problem: i'm assuming i need a negative (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high. is a negative logic high (i've seen this in schematics) the same thing as an active low, or what? i'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how would i get a negative logic high out of this thing? i need to have all three signals available: logic high, logic low, and negative logic high. any help would be greatly appreciated. also, please reply via email, as i never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately. thanks much, -mark umlangston@memstvx1.memst.edu

jeh@cmkrnl.com writes: > >hmmm. how are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in >computer rooms) wired? they require two separate grounds. one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate, if any). the box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground. the outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to the building-entrance main ground by its own wire. so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building's service entrance. but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building, while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated-ground outlets of that panel. if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 600v feeder to ground, the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise-free.

fyi: the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp deskjet is 1/600th inch. the electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. on almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway. the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology. it doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers. recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput: 10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer. something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer. a 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $us 75-80 at discount while hp high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $us 22 at discount. it could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers. it is getting progressively closer between the two technologies. laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

write a good manual to go with the software. the hassle of photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only $15. also, consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for registered users. for instance, a coffee mug. you could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95. you're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use are non-licensed users. the best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into your price structure. sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad. retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying customers; the software industry is the same. unless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly copy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

hello-- i just bought a new portable cd player for the office, and i notice that it proudly proclaims "8 times oversampling" on the box. now while i think i understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples" exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor), i don't understand this "8 times" business... it seems to me that when i bought my first cd player (was it really 10 years ago?!), the specs said "4 times" ... could someone please tell me whether i'm getting senile? if i'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate? if i really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process? furthermore, am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium? does this mean that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has changed since 1983? i'm so confused... --cliff -- | clifford bowman, box 1890, russellville, ar 72811 | hcb@netcom.com | | i'm pretty sure the world *isn't* fair... if it | (501) 968-2232 | | were, i'd be a lot worse off! | n5tju |

i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. this implies a 200uf cap. i have built a very satisfactorily operating version from a max641, but do not like the idea of using a $6 single source part. it seems that the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what i want, but i cant get mine apart without breaking it. i would appreciate receiving the circuit description or a source of one. i have already looked in several electronics circuits handbooks to no avail. thanx -- ______________________________________________ | martin johnson martyj@uiuc.edu | | "mind your business", on first us coin | |____________________________________________|

[note: i just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so i could be wrong.] the data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 khz, 16 bit, two channel data. oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling. when i asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated. anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 khz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters. for the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters. so, assuming the quality of all other components in a cd player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering. 					---joel kolstad

(note - i do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting). put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven. set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.) stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow. leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator. if you are using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway through. if you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub for this stuff. gerald.belton@ozonehole.com * slmr 2.1 * i still miss my boss, but my aim is improving. ---- the ozone hole bbs * a private bulletin board service * (504)891-3142 3 full service nodes * usrobotics 16.8k bps * 10 gigs * 100,000 files skydive new orleans! * rime network mail hub * 500+ usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to: postmaster@ozonehole.com

i live in the san francisco bay area, and word has it that something similar is on its way here. since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the santa clara area i'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the east bay. i'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway. an announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it. they're apparently also looking into licensing a low-am frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system. in the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead. my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge. perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read "cheap"). we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels 2 and 36. these are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'auto talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area. in la, they're probably using some other tv channels, but the concept is the same. try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. i believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it). since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves. you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens. perhaps a word to the wise...? ;) i think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system is networked and paid for. cheers, alan <acooney@netcom.com>

one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys... for our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs: voltatge: adjustable from 1-12v current: *limited* at 1a voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for i from 0-1a ac ripple less than 5 mv (rms) of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^) our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit). what the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1a, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp. thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp. if we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1v. the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor, and therefore reduce the output. so, does anybody have any ideas we could work from? thanks in advance. andy collins, kc6yey acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu ps: if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, i agree fully, but i still have to do it, its graded ;^)
try the folks at dimolex corp., la crescenta, ca 91214. their number is (818) 957-7001. they make membrane keypads that are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys. they have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as backlit models. some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle. many of the models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel, colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make your own layout. one piece prices aren't cheap, though, as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45 for a 40 position *kit*. i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connected with them. i *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them, and am pleased with what i got. cheers, alan <acooney@netcom.com>

i've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pf loads on the clock lines. (design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the mosis scalable design rules.) here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors: 1) they don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is 	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the 	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground 	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 2) they do help a lot with on-chip loads, as i had with the high load 	on the clock lines. 3) the transients you are trying to suppress are really high 	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff 	capacitors, since the rc time constant is too large. 	what i did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich, 	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent 	diff-metal1 contacts. i forget exactly how wide the poly 	lines were. if i were doing this design again, i'd probably 	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead, 	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high 	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds). 4) you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with 	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for 	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors. 	i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for 	a mosis tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as i 	needed. kevin karplus -- kevin karplus		karplus@ce.ucsc.edu due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is being turned off.

tony wayne writes: >what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments? >-tony pink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency components than white noise. if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal. often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass filtering a white noise signal. therefore pink noise contains much more low-frequency components. the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals. an additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why. enjoy it. wouter.

"can you say qualified sales leads? i thought you could." what's the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards? never circle more than 8 number on the card. if you want more than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks later. if you are really, really serious and you really, really want the information, call the advertiser and ask! this will also cut about 15 days off the the response time. virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout. to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three numbers. include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house. advertisers almost never call. john schuch publisher of: the arizona high-tech times the arizona electrical journal the arizona hvac news (all of which have bingo cards)

(and don't ask me which ones they are.) determined pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once found by authorities. it is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage. what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup "registered to xxxxx -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above. two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus violated their license agreement. this way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer. the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights, and can restore to different machines. on the other hand, the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is supposed to be. if this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement. of course, a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it? --kasey chang
if companies compressed their executables with lzw andd did some kind of encryption in the process, this "change two bytes here" thing would go right out the window. -- michael chen			| from the depths of our most lucid horrors | 				| spring our fond hopes and pure desires... | mchen@cs.psu.edu		| except what comes from hell! :-) 7/23/92 |

(sounds like something a p.e. should know about anyway ;-). >> seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength >> and determine distance. this would be for short distances (2000 ft), >> and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so. this is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit over time. you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. with the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at one place, it is much easier to do. note especially that the time base for the r.a. receiver and transmitter is one unit also... >depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in >a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this >concept. nope. fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. that is, unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength. this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes. signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong... >> what frequencies would be best for this? or does matter? as high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals. radio altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 ghz. hope this helps... -- ========================================================== jack brindle ham radio: wa4fib internet: jackb@mdd.comm.mot.com

"pirate board" or no pirate board. i too have "friends" who blatantly and quite successfuly "hack" copy protection schemes practically in their sleep. let's consider what goes on in our lab. almost daily we have at least one machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some setting or other on a piece of software. admittedly, we (being students, mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network administrators, but we try. keeping even the twenty machines that are (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and "acting" similar to the average user, and maintaining "behind-the-scenes" consistency is a real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his disk. often we have hardware problems at peak "business" times and have to do some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . . well, i'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . .. the point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration files etc. from machine to machine. by far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to, then copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that machine's type). this ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have ten identical machines to work with. having them networked simplifies this considerably, as our major packages (wordperfect, windows, etc.) are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with. often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project. this is usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what i believe the original poster was asking about. the few we have had with "copy protection" schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain . . in short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme. it's sort of like outlawing guns. the criminals will get your program anyway, and you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user. write a good user's guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (please do this regardless of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute the manual to licensed users. jack the price to cut your losses, but please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the legitimate user with a "copy protection" scheme! sorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-) mark s. underwood ee student, university of kentucky lab assistant, boyd hall microlab 	(a tiny little division of uk library microlabs) e-mail: msunde01@mik.uky.edu > the program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends > on the programmer... don't use a disk drive characteristic!) if the user > did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way. > no document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear! > > i did not say that the originals would allow only one install. the user's > conscience should do that. > > i know, i'll get flamed for this... but with the increasing number of "casual" > users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights > (it's the truth. i have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest games > all the time, and when i refused, they went after somebody else.), casual > pirating is becoming more of a problem. some sort of copy protection will > discourage the casual copying. i've seen what some of my "friends" dug up > somewhere... latest and the greatest games, all cracked, within days of actual > release! you know how many bytes you need to change in x-wing to disable > the quiz? two! yes, two!

one way to make cheap trimmable resistors is to use a high-wattage carbon composition resistor, and saw a notch in it with a triangular file. of course, you can only increase the resistance, not decrease it.

the simplest and cheapest soft uv bulb is an ar-1 argon bulb (or other argon bulb). it works like a neon bulb except it glows purple. it will cause stuff to fluoresce. it requires very little power, just a battery, an oscillator, and a step-up transformer to about 100 volts. electronic goldmine (602) 451-7454 has several uv lamps, both as pre-built units and kits. ask for their catalog.

hi, i am looking an integrated circuits for my z80-based computer. the circuit is called z80-sti (serial timer interrupt), mk3801, and made by mostek. mostek is called sgs thompson today. i have been in contact with sgs thompson, unfortunately they me told that z80-sti is obsolete. so, my question is if anyone know if i can get hold of that circuits. are there any companies that specialize in selling circuits that are no longer in production? i have contacted several electronic brokers in sweden, but without any success. i would appreciate if you could give me hint where i should continue looking. even companies in the united states would be fine, since this circuit is pretty crucial to me. thanks in advance. thomas thor royal institute of technology stockholm, sweden

	greetings. i've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators 	and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...

i just got caller-id (except bell calls it "call display" and didn't know what i was talking about when i asked for "caller-id"). i got the cheapest display box i could find, and hope to convert it to serial out. the chip used is an 18-pin dip marked "cdt 14-285" and "1473 9220". i presume the 9220 is the date. i'm hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip, to save me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope, asking my friends to call me again and again. i'll post any interesting replies, and my experiences. -simon tooke simon@sco.com

much deleted about assembly in usa vs. other, i wish to focus on the subject of warm-running amplifiers: > : > sure the amp runs very fairly > : > hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good. > > : an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound. > : the amp you have probably is running class-a the whole day. > > : because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted > : to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs! hmmmmm.... > there is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound, or in your words, "it does have a bearing on....". now, i don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan, but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one. and since junction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental effect on linearity. a few facts: -bias points vary with temperature -junction resist varrie with temp -adcom products do not run class-a if you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements for most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier warm-up. on many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for the output stage, many hours for the drivers. fortunately the drivers are not switched. in any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening, betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias (idle current) level. both have a positive correlation with low distortion and "good" sound quality, and high bias results in warmer operation, all other factors being equal. grant

(and don't ask me which ones they are.) 	do you know any assembly language at all? all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it. not that difficult, really! and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. using pklite or some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .exe were tagged as uncompressable. > what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus > a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup > "registered to xxxxx -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above. 	this is by far the best idea you presented in your post. making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. but, the determined ones are just going to answer "joe blow" to the question of "what's your name" so this won't stop them in the long run. 	pirates are always going to win this fight. they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme. -- steve madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu ask me about linux, the free 386 unix!

the battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold. the temperature combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of the battery. i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite cooler.

hello, i'm looking for information on alphanumeric pagers and *how* the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how i would go about building a device to decode the paging data (like my pager does) and feed it though an rs232 port. i'm planning on seperating different paging messages and different pagers in software to keep amount of hardware i need down.... does anyone know what chips (motorola?) are good for decoding numeric and alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing it down an rs232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ? (i already have a radio reciever with headphone level output for the audio signal from the paging tower, but i'd be interested in anything you know about pagers, including the type of radio recievers they use!) thanks in advance! -theo email = theo@walt.caps.maine.edu

i'm working on an audio mixer project, but i'm having trouble finding parts. i want to use op-amps for the gain control stages. the ones i have found that are good for audio are lm739 and lm833, but i cannot find either of these in the electronic parts places i've looked. are there any good substitute op-amps and/or are there any parts suppliers in the la area that carry this kind of thing (10kohm dual audio taper slider pots would be nice, too). any info would be appreciated. thanks in advance. martin lin triumvir@cco.caltech.edu

i have a project in mind that requires an array of leds that can be addressed individually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so). is there an lsi that is designed to drive an led array (including ram to hold the array state), or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so i don't have to latch a bit for each led using a discrete latch?

(although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a "snubber" diode across it would tell you. actually, many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in.) the basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in a somewhat simplified manner): the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage, more-or-less unregulated dc rail. the energy storage (or "filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor. the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer, resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which are then rectified and filtered. at least one of the transformer's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor, which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (pwm) fashion to control (by varying the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary. the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear regulation added. you may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the pwm control (which is most typically an ic) is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated. often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement. while the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor a bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another. in some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others, you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the imagination! :-)). i'm not by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above. bob myers kc0ew hewlett-packard co. |opinions expressed here are not systems technology div. |those of my employer or any other myers@fc.hp.com fort collins, colorado |sentient life-form on this planet.

> why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable) > when stored on a concrete floor? when will people learn! the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast resistors are used to discharge batteries. furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast. seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. i have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for > 2 years so it must be possible. if your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). occasionally charge it (once a month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, don't do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous). anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

i'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player. how could i do this? i don't want it just to turn on, i want it to 'strobe' once so to speak, per every beep i put on a cassette tape. would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency? is there any easy way to do either of these? i'm looking for the simplest circuit possible. i guess what i'm asking for is some sort of color organ, but not quite. let me trt to explain again... i'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape. so on the tape you'd hear: beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc. , with speed increasing as time goes on. i want to synchronize an led ( probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. so the led, with each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort of effect. the rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the leds. and if there was no sound on the tape (except for background his), the leds would remain off. please help! thanks, dana

where can i buy blinking leds besides radio shack? * does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate?

i think a few things are being missed overall here... first of all, anyone with a dos manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely dos ignorant) off of a hard disk. 'professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks. they are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to computer games. those people are in the minority, however. in my experience with the world of people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will at some point copy a friend's program ("gee, you really oughta try this") or accept a copy. these are people who normally would buy a software package or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter. the last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one computer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * x# of computers for the same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially things like dos upgrades. -- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | are we having fun yet? | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

(i.e., run by microcontrollers?) the easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the boards is talking to the pc. when this line was true, the other boards could all hold off and not send their data. this isn't a perfect solution, though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't decide to talk at the _exact same time_. other than that, i think you will need to hook up each board to "something" that speaks rs-232. this actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it used to be, though. assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 bps or slower), the pics can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex the data. (this is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first paragraph to your system. and it assumes that each board doesn't talk more than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a pic isn't going to be able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!) you might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your pc, though. i recently bought a boca research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4 rs-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85. 					---joel kolstad

hmmm... a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold. the clerk sticks it in the store pc and asks for the buyers id. later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. in addition copies which were sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to track in store piracy. possible additional program security schemes would be: 1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in and registration. (inconvenient) 2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive) 3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness) 4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc. (only as effective as above methods at best.) 5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive.

i thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post. some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries. one year, i left the batteries in the garage. the garage is unheated. they were left in their places that they needed to be. one in the riding lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle. the battery in the riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries was new, and one was around 5 years old. upon spring time, i discovered that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged. they all worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer. (they had originally been stored in the garage, and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring) last year, i decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts. one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete. i brought in all three, and discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries dead, but when i put the charger on them, the charger said "hmmmmmmmm" and the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000 (in other words, it was pinned) the internal circut tripped, and i went on to the other batteries. they were the same. realizing that we still had 2 gigantic sailboat batteries, also lead acid, i decided to put the charger on them. (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle. i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they worked fine for around 25 of 'em. this leads me to believe one of several things. 1) i bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true) 2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries. 3) there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is, 4) the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete. (btw, i can almost waterski in the dirt room) any other ideas? *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*

i recently took apart my color sony tv to clean the volume pushbuttons and when i put the beast back together, the flyback whine got much louder. is this easy to fix? which part is resonating? i have heard rumors of a spray that will fix the noise. is this a simple thing for a tv repairman to fix? 	thanks, 		scott

	just thought i would add $0.02 to deskjet thread. i got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago. 	i've been a happy hp user of the deskwriter for macintosh for past 5 years. i got one just a few months after their release. and i got software revision 1.0a (now i'm up to rev. 3.1. our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own dw's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty imagewriter ii's). the original dw has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. i would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one (small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so. 	my brother might take this dw now (i'm probably gonna give it to him), and i am looking to upgrade to a color dw. the chief advantages/disadvantages i've found over the years are: advantages:	quick (2-3 ppm), quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), appletalk networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. i rewired our home with phonenet appletalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one dw!), and cheap (now run ~$300). btw, you can upgrade older dw's to color or for appletalk, i dunno if hp still does the upgrades, but i received many offers (i just didn't ned it however). also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those imagewriter dot-matrix people so much so, that i had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....) disadvantages.	ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. while hp has done wonders with the ink (i dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts (i get mine from elek-tek in chicago, i think they're now down to $12). the ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but i don't think they say so anymore. we stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper (after fooling for a long time. laser/xerox paper is also good). smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. other disadvantages are : no postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press software solutions. i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting lj sales. in the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript (unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board transparencies for photoetching. i found a textronix color phaser postscript (thermal wax transfer) to work the best to make pcb negatives directly onto a transparency. well, hope my babbling has helped. -squish@endor.harvard.edu

(i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but i may be wrong. oh well, i don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and i don't feel like thinking through it right now.) what is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be, is exothermic, or energy discharging. if moisture with dissolved electrolytes (acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals may form. this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds. the reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery charger) is put back into the battery. lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge. each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction. the non-reacting posts (terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric energy during a discharge (or charge). because the reaction is exothermic, it has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances. so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution. to understand why lead-acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall lechatelier's principle, which can be paraphrased as: anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position. here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials: thermal conductivity material temperature, c (f) btu/(hr-ft-ft)(f/ft) -------- ------------------ -------------------- diatomaceous earth, 204 0.051 natural, across strata 871 0.077 diatomaceous, natural, 204 0.081 parallel to strata 871 0.106 diatomaceous earth powder (100) 0.039 (density, 18 lb/cu.ft) (200) 0.042 (300) 0.044 (400) 0.048 (500) 0.051 concrete (cinder) --- 0.20 (stone) --- 0.54 (1:4 dry) --- 0.44 pine (across grain) 15 0.087 (parallel to grain) 21 0.20 oak (across grain) 15 0.12 maple (across grain) 50 0.11 note that the thermal conductivity for "dirt" (diatomaceous earth) goes down with temperature. also, 204 c is about 400 k, and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth. the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4 times greater than wood. it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood. at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity or heat. (thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 btu/(hr-ft-ft)(f/ft).) during storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat. the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface. thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature, the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt. this is where lechatelier's principle comes into play. removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion. if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced. a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface. store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which "pulls" the reaction along. also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water. this will tend to drive the discharge reaction. jeff white jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu "how do i get the ketchup out of my pocket protector?" french fries!

	being in the "visualization" stage of a circuit design right now, i was wondering what the best way to "scale" an ac voltage using an 8-bit digital word is. i am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage (converted to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. however, i am leary of this method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b) creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line. i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference, but that would require more parts and boost the price further. 	someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 8 bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on-chip. unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer; if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me. 	i am building this project as a "dimmer box" for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). therefor, if each box costs $150, i doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 = $2400) for sixteen channels... this is something i have noticed about today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive! 	anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated! 	michael carr 	m-carr@onu.edu

there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard. older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side (viewed from front) of the printer. newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide. the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out. there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation. hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism. i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer. i don't have the information handy. i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit. hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade. i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500. the kit was fairly expensive. you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much. upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no soldering. upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts. contact your hp service center for further information. the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers, especially the newer laser printers. the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line. this makes no material difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster. as you might guess, the result is hideously slow printing. the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior. from the way wordperfect works, this would not be easy to change. windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows'. the pcl4 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory. an uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 kbytes, but the printer needs about 300k of memory for its internal house-keeping. laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations. deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts. a single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds. this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer. the presumption, of course, being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle. until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable. i won't use the word impossible, but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the problem. laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components. hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges, mitigating the material waste problem to a degree. energy waste could use more work. warm-up times have decreased, allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv. kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system. the image drum is good for approximately 100k copies. it is a very nice print engine. i wish hp used the kyocera engine. kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system. the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp's laser printers. the pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out. the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service. replacement cost for the transport is almost $200. the feed rollers are not separately replacable, though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer. it depends upon the application which printer is best for you. if you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice. as noted, the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

what are people's opinions about laser detectors? escort makes a laser detector, the passport 1000, and claims it works fine. however, i've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector. otherwise it won't work. regular radar, of course, travels in all directions; hence it is more detectable. any comments? escort has a deal (till the end of april, i think), where if you buy their wideband (passport 3200 - x, k, ka) and laser detectors, you'll save $60 off of buying them separately. in this case, the addition of the laser detector over the passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. passport 1000 normally costs $100). -- eddie gornish university of illinois - center for supercomputing research & development gornish@csrd.uiuc.edu

why are circuit boards green? the material used to make them goes by two names. if it is used to make circuit boards it is called fr-4. the same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called g-10. fr-4 and g-10 are both green. they are not green because of a solder masking agent. the basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers. i am not sure what the specs are on the resin, but if you are really curious you can call nema (national electronics manufacturing association) or ciba geigy (a major manufacturer of epoxy resins) to find out. as an aside, i occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments. the proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in g-10. they are the same green color.

(more about this later.) what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course) the battery slowly self discharges. as this discharge takes place two things happen. -the level of pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved). -the level of h30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like). now, as the post to which i am responding correctly stated, pbso4 will precipitate in a water (non-acid) solution. when the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged) we end up with a high concentration of pb++ and so4-- in water. so pbso4 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery (of course this happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms). the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery. if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results. i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they are for the most part useless. they can dissolve the pbso4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly. you may have some success with these products for a newer battery.

(besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature. the air would amply dissipate any such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not. this is of course irrelevant, since you would want the battery to be cool during storage.) just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

what i usually use...and this stuff is only good on glass....is either acetone, or a little benzene. the latter of the two is a bit dangerous (possibly a carcinogen(sp?)) but it usualy gets the job done. i imagine you can you the two solvents on most metals as well as glass, but keep the stuff away from plastic. better yet, you may just want to go to your local hardware store and ask them what they use.

hello there. the other day i was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought about constructing an old-time crytal radio set. i figured on substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the antenna coil, etc., myself. the only problem i seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits. well these things seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats. trimmer capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this application. so, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 0--360 pf range? manythanks. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ greg neill, | ounce (ouns), n. - the standard unit of hnsx supercomputers inc.| prevention, equal to one pound of cure. gneill@cid.aes.doe.ca |

acetone will likely damage the carpet. first solvent to try is denatured alcohol. do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol. you can use methyl alcohol instead of denatured alcohol. if you want to have a cocktail while you are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol :-). if the alcohol does not work try carbon tetrachloride. if neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. good luck. jim

does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data i/o (print spooler, digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a dma chip or a dedicated microcontroller? essentially what i am trying to decide is the best way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart data i/o. which dma or microcontroller chip would be best to use? fast, cheap, and easy to obtain would be nice, but i won't limit my choices to only those that fit those characteristics. even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what i want, but i am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with onchip (e)eprom. so i essentially want to hear about all dma and microcontrollers that are simple to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a few i/o lines. jeff white jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu

(no, i ain't going to explain resection over the net.) given hindsight, i would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling phototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at the several expected frequencies, to extract amplitude of each beacon. by doing this at the numerous steps, even with 8 degree steps, with knowledge of the angular response of the phototransistor, you should be able to rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon. allen sullivan

i was a bit surprised that the manual for my fluke-87 multimeter suggests applying wd-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the current range socket. the intention is to prevent the test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there is no test lead in that socket. the manual is a bit vague, but i think i'd apply the wd-40 to a swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly from the can. speaking of said meters: i compared the 87 against the 8060a that i've had on my bench for almost 11 years. it has been five years since the 8060a has been calibrated. on the dc scale, they agree within .01 mv. ac scale is within about .1 mv. the 87 would be just about the perfect portable meter if it had the db scale; i didn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since i don't use db all that much in my work. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed

while i have gotten 8-9 years out of this digital receiver, it has been acting verry strange of late. i hope that the following	 symptoms may help someone diagnose the error: - i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had - has long died thus if i unplug it - it won't remember the presets - it has given up listening to the remote. (i tried changing the remote's batteries) when i try a remote function - the receiver registers that it received it (a green remote light flashes) but the right function doesn't happen - if any function at all. (also strange- when i hit the "mute" button, for example, the display panel goes black - yikes-	 i've never seen that before ...) - before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself off and on again - by itself - sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it (yes kinda flex the motherboard, chasis) for it to get the radio tuning back - the aux in function always works however.... it is inconvenient, but not inconvenient enough to pay an expensive repair fee. while, i'm not a hardware guy, i wonder if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix. the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go ... someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip. -anyway ...arghh -cjk

fiberglass boards are available in several colors. sitting right here, i have unetched board stock that is white, blue, green and yellow respectively. i've also seen black boards. solder mask is available in a variety of colors too. depending on the supplier, the color helps indentify the material. don't forget conformal coating. i don't think i've seen phenolic impregnated paper boards in anything other than the familar brown, but it would not be difficult to add a dye to change the color. -- bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown, oh 44272-9995 usa phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1) 146.580: n8wed
