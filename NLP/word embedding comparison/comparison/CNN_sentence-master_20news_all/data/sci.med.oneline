i have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his illness is the rare gaucher's disease. gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). the problem (in type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. this will eventually cause death. enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the fda in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition. ceredase, which is manufactured by biotech biggy company--genzyme--costs the patient $380,000 per year. gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most expensive disease in the world". need info: i have researched gaucher's disease at the library but am relying on netlanders to provide me with any additional information: **news, stories, reports **people you know with this disease **ideas, articles about genzyme corp, how to get a hold of enough money to buy some, programs available to help with costs. **basically any help you can offer thanks so very much! deborah

a friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has emphysema. his lung capacity has decreased over time. his father died of the disease. he works in woodworking. i believe he has a very occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less. he tells me this..i've never seen him light up. he has some pretty healthy life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy etc. anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up. i know really nothing about the disease. i believe it interferes with the lining of the lung being able to exchange oxygen. is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence? if he were to give up smoking entirely would that better his chances for recovery? what are some modern therapies used in people with this disease? i would appreciate any information. thanks. amigan@cup.portal.com

(she isn't diabetic--they checked. 	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone 	 poles do not appear to be straight) 	7. loss of peripheral vision. 	 	many tests have been run and all are normal except for something called unidentified bright objects found on a mri of her brain. the only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone. at times she had been on 60 mg per day. whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again. 	she is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming worse with each episode and her vision is suffering. none of the docs she has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop it. any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance. kathy turner

getting back to the original question in this thread: i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those described. in my case, it turned out that i was developing type i diabetes. although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my doctor, i think that the breathing problem was associated with the presence of ketones due to the diabetes. i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting their food intake drastically. i don't know if this relevant in this case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating properly. -- steve kirchoefer (202) 767-2862 code 6851 kirchoefer@estd.nrl.navy.mil naval research laboratory microwave technology branch washington, dc 20375-5000 electronics sci. and tech. division

my 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose. i bought him clearasil face wash and ointment. i think that is probably enough, along with the usual good diet. however, he is on at me to get some product called dalacin t, which used to be a doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter. i have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for dalacin t, or that clearasil is ok. i had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious. his father was the same, so i don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring. but i know kids are senstitive about their appearance. i am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin a from acne treatment. i want to help - but with appropriate treatment. my son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp. sort of teenage cradle cap. any pointers/advice on this? we have tried a couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to make the condition worse, not better. shall i bury the kid till he's 21 :) -- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the floggings will continue until morale improves pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz pat churchill, wellington new zealand

a very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month. but it does not prevent the fertilzation of the ovule. is it true ? if yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the fallopian tube ? j.cherbonnier jec@zurich.ibm.com

thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question. the final diagnosis was stress. i did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment. (rachel receives all her medical care at keller army hospital since she is a military dependant, and the army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments as part of its regular health care.) i am hoping that the arrival of (1) spring break, and (2) college acceptance letters, will help. *unfortunately* she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while. :-( meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me. thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas. ------------------------ ruth ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu> philosophy department;wesleyan university;usa

"situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. it is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be "random." people with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side). according to harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. but there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion. i would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of which there is probably one at ncsu. -km

"real" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. i'm limited to a couple of minutes. whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. supposedly, only "true" clubbing is associated with disease. the problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. however, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization. the cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally. clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent. -km

i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), i seemed to get a lot of migraines. but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here. i generally don't take nsaids or tylenol for headaches, because i've found them to be ineffective. however, i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids (currently naprosyn). first, is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle. i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back. i've tried synarel, it reduced the pain while i took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after i stopped. three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only "real solution" to my problem. although i don't expect to have any more children, i don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis). one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children. so basically all i'm left with is toughing out the pain. this would be impossible without naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so i'm through with it). in fact, naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as i'll discuss in a moment. generally though, i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while). in the meantime i'm frequently in severe pain. the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy. i've had mris, xrays, ct scan, and emgs (i've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests. the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain. the mri reports both say i have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the xrays (and mri, i think) it is apparent that i have arthritis. the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations (l3-l4, and l4-l5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg. oh yeah, i had some other horrible test, called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the "internal nerves" are working fine. anyway, the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain. the back pain is there all the time, but i can live with it. when the leg pain is there, i need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work. so i took naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so i'd always resume). since last november i have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain. i have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week). after the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight). after a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage). so now, i don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago. getting back to my original reason for this post... even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, i really can't avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (oh, i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery, but i'm avoiding that too). i find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally i have to take off work, but usually i can work, but at a reduced capacity (i'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing). when the pelvic pain is bad, i can't concentrate much, i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome. when the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad i can't really sit at all. then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed. so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources. i get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. i've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage), but i don't like the side effects (if i take more than two i get diahrea). if i get a very bad headache, i will eventually take the cafergot. my neurologist wasn't very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, i should try that. i've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or i couldn't tolerate them. so what can i do? my doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which i agree with most of the time, but not when i have a lot of pain. i've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and i've already had surgery several times. anyway, the point of what i'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people need to take them to tolerate other pain. janice rathmann

i may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but i certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to n.c.). here are some observations gained from painful experience: 1. reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person. some people get tiny red bites. others (like me) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs. 2. chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving. i swear that these things will itch for months. 3. there is a lot of folklore about chiggers. i think most of it is fiction. i have tried to do research on the critters, since they have such an effect on me. the only book i could find on the subject was a *single* book in unc's special collections library. i have not yet gone through what is required to get it. 4. based on my experience and that of my family members, the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work. i recall reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false. i think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release. but this is speculation. 5. the *best* approach is prevention. a couple of things work well. a good insect repellent (deet) such as deep woods off liberally applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start. there is another preparation called "chig away" that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was prepared for the army and is not commercially available. in the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get up on weekends since i literally can't go outside where we live (in the country) without serious consequences. (they apparently don't like sulfur much at all. you can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.) 6. no amount of prevention will be *completely* successful. forget the fingernail polish. i have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine (relieves the itch). i won't tell you all the things i've tried. nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (i also think it gains nothing). 7. the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery as well. doctors seem not to care much about chiggers. the urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much. and the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure. i suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money. -- gary h. merrill [principal systems developer, c compiler development] sas institute inc. / sas campus dr. / cary, nc 27513 / (919) 677-8000 sasghm@theseus.unx.sas.com ... !mcnc!sas!sasghm

the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high and increasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being systematically ignored and suppressed by the money-grubbing and power- mongering "medical" establishment. some examples of very low cost natural anti-cancer remedies are listed in the following article: natural anti-cancer remedies a 3rd opinion ( some of these remedies also work against aids. ) disclaimer: this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable. the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice. ( most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store. most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store. what is important is how they are used, and what else is excluded during their use. ) (1) the 7-day fast. 1st day: eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind at a time, preferably grapes. 2nd day: eat all the vegetables you want, at least half raw, including garlic; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want. preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice with pulp, followed by a gallon of pure (not from concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice. (stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: eat all the un-salted nuts (no peanuts) and dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (almonds contain laetrile.). 5th day: one gallon of lemonade. squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (no sugar). drink one glass per hour. [everyone, including healthy people, should do this one day every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp.] 6th day: same as 5th day. 7th day: same as 6th day. all 7 days, eat only the foods listed above for each day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, plus as much distilled water as you want. (2) the grape diet. eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 am to 8 pm, every day for six days. eat nothing else during the six days, but drink as much distilled water as you want. (3) apple cider vinegar. mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (not apple cider "flavored" vinegar. regular vinegar is harmful.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a week. repeat if desired. do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods. this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. (4) the sea-salt & soda bath. [please keep an open mind.] fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of sun-evaporated sea-salt (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, chomping your teeth together, etc.. among other things, the sea-salt & soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x-rays, etc., as described in the book "born to be magnetic, vol. 2", by frances nixon, 1973. precautions: only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. for at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away from, and even out of sight of, other people. (your greatly expanded aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.) two hours after the bath, eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures. (the bath may kill friendly bacteria also.) better yet, take a 2-billion-bacteria "acidophilus" capsule, which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of "a.i.d.s." (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune system). [because this external bath can kill in-ternal bacteria, it may also be a cure for "lyme disease".] do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "major" or "minor periods" as listed in the "solunar tables" published bimonthly in "field & stream" magazine, (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). do not take this bath more than four times per year. (5) miscellaneous natural anti-cancer remedies: for skin cancer, apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally, for about 2 months. d.m.s.o. (dimethyl sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions. almonds (un-blanched, un-roasted) contain laetrile. to help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day. to help cure cancer, eat several ounces of almonds per day. [never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally. it will kill you! take it intravenously only. (cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide, which then kills the cell. this enzyme is also present in the digestive system.)] anti-oxidants are free-radical scavengers, and include vitamin e, selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most people.), chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), vitamin a (25,000 iu per day is safe for most people.), superoxide dismutase (up to 4,000,000 units per day), vitamin c (up to 3000 mg. per day), and bht (butylated hydroxy- toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes (both types), suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not cure herpes. bht might also do these things against "a.i.d.s.", which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia.] (see the book "life extension", by durk pearson and sandy shaw.) hydrogen-peroxide. dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably distilled) and drink it. do this once or twice per day, hours before or after eating or drinking anything else. apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day. use hydrogen-peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above. vitamin & mineral supplements are more effective, and much less expensive, when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources. cancer cells can not live in a strong (100,000 maxwell) north magnetic field, especially if it is pulsating on and off. [a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac.] in my opinion, all types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-maxwell north magnetic fields. properly made and operated radionics/psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well as most other medical problems. some radionics/psionics machines can even take cross-sectional x-ray-like photos of cancer tumors, etc., with-out x-rays! interferon tablets. taheebo tea, (lapacho). homeopathy can cure cancer, and many other medical problems (even drug addiction!). 50 mg. per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble. this list is not exhaustive. the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un- diagnosed cancers, as well as prevent them, and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases. they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively. besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these remedies, especially the 7-day fast and the grape diet, send a strong message to one's subconscious mind, programming it to cure the cancer. in my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above, in sequence (starting with the 7-day fast), before resorting to the un-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [poison, burn, and mutilate!] of orthodox cancer treatment [organi$ed-crime!]. disclaimer: this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable. the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice. for more information, contact cancer control society, 2043 n. berendo st., los angeles, ca 90027, and/or other organiza- tions listed in the "alternative medicine" and "holistic medicine" portions of the "health and medical organizations" section (section 8) of the latest edition of the "encyclope- dia of associations" reference book in your local public or university library. un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important information is encouraged. robert e. mcelwaine

big...) ============== using a pc's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues mini outline: 1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2. x terminals 3. next 4. silicon graphics 5. ibm rs/6000 	6. other stuff 1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 	if you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard 	(sun, hp, dec, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding 	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard. if your workstation 	runs the x window system, you're in luck. you can buy a cheap used 	pc, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable 	to your workstation. then, run a program on the workstation to read 	the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events. 	the two main programs i've found to do this are kt and a2x. 	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and 	even moving among widgets on the screen. it requires a server 	extension (xtest, dec-xtrap, or xtestextension1). to find out if your 	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings 	appear in the extensions list. if your server doesn't have this, 	you may want to investigate compiling x11r5, patchlevel 18 or later, 	or bugging your vendor. 	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended x servers. 	another program called xsendevent also exists, but i haven't seen it. 	both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu. 2. x terminals 	also, a number of x terminals (ncd, tektronics, to name a few) use 	pc-compatible keyboards. if you have an x terminal, you may be all 	set. try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the 	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard. also, some x terminals add 	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around 	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the setup key. 3. next 	next had announced that new next machines will use the apple desktop 	bus, meaning any mac keyboard will work. then, they announced they 	were cancelling their hardware production. if you want any kind of 	upgrade for an older next, do it now! 4. silicon graphics 	silicon graphics has announced that their newer machines (indigo^2 and 	beyond) will use standard pc-compatible keyboards and mice. i don't 	believe this also applies to the power series machines. it's not 	possible to upgrade an older sgi to use pc keyboards, except by 	upgrading the entire machine. contact your sgi sales rep for more 	details. 5. ibm rs/6000 	ibm rs/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal pc keyboards. || 	unfortunately, you can't just plug one in. you need two things: a || 	cable converter to go from the large pc keyboard connector to the || 	smaller ps/2 style din-6, and a new device driver for aix. believe || 	it or not, ibm wrote this device driver recently, i used it, and it || 	works. however, they don't want me to redistribute it. i've been || 	told judy hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact. if you learn || 	anything new, please send me e-mail.				 || 6. other stuff 	some vendors here (notably: health care keyboard co. and accucorp) 	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your 	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer. if you can 	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either 	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in 	luck. contact the companies for more details. apple adjustable keyboard apple computer, inc. sales offices all over the place. availability: february, 1993 price: $219 supports: mac only apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard. the keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate backward on a hinge. the sections do not tilt upward. the keys are arranged in a normal qwerty fashion. the main foldable keyboard resembles a normal apple keyboard. a separate keypad contains all the extended key functions. the keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not directly attachable to the keyboard. as soon as soda comes back up, i'll have a detailed blurb from tidbits available there. flexpro keyboard key tronic phone: 800-262-6006 possible contact: denise razzeto, 509-927-5299 sold by many clone vendors and pc shops availability: spring, 1993 (?) price: $489 (?) supports: pc only (highly likely) keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at comdex. it's another split-design. one thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section. the arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key pc keyboard. keytronic makes standard pc keyboards, also, so this product will probably be sold through their standard distribution channels. dragondictate-30k (and numerous other dragon products) dragon systems, inc. 320 nevada street newton, ma 02160 phone: 800-talk-typ or 617-965-5200 fax: 617-527-0372 shipping: now. price: dragondictate-30k -- $4995 (end

support for mac) 	free software support for x windows is also available -- your 	pc with dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a 	serial cable or network. the program is called a2x, and is 	available via anonymous ftp: 	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.z 	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.z (most current) 	if you want to use your dragon product with x windows, you may want 	to ask for peter cohen, an salesman at dragon who knows more about 	this sort of thing. dragon systems sells a number of voice recognition products. most (if not all) of them seem to run on pc's and compatibles (including ps/2's and other microchannel boxes). they sell you a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors and spreadsheets. each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly. multiple people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file for each person. you still get the use of your normal keyboard, too. on the dragondictate-30k you need to pause 1/10th sec between words. dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute. i don't have specs on the dragonwriter 1000. the dragondictate-30k can recognize 30,000 words at a time. the dragonwriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time. dragon's technology is also

archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software version: 1.8, 7th december 1992 this faq is actually maintained by richard donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk>. i post it, along with the other faq stuff. if you have questions, you want to send mail to richard, not me. -- dan 		 software tools to help with rsi 		 ------------------------------- this file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage rsi. this version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches... please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and i will update this faq. i am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them. richard donkin internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) fax: +44 71 251 2853 changes in this version: added information on stressfree, another typing management tool for windows. typing management tools: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often. the better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup. some use sound hardware to warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages. often, rsi appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. these tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting rsi. tool: at your service (commercial software) available from: 	bright star 	tel: +1 (206) 451 3697 platforms: mac (system 6.0.4), windows description: 	provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. 	warns when to take a break (configurable). has a few recommendations 	on posture, and exercises. sound-oriented, will probably work best 	with sound card (pc) or with microphone (mac). should be possible 	to record your own messages to warn of break. tool: audioport (sound card and software) available from: 	media vision 	tel: +1 (510) 226 2563 platforms: pc description: 	a sound card to plug into your pc parallel port. 	includes 'at your service'. tool: computer health break (commercial software) available from: 	escape ergonomics, inc 	1111 w. el camino real 	suite 109 	mailstop 403 	sunnyvale, ca 	tel: +1 (408) 730 8410 platforms: dos description: 	aimed at preventing rsi, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or 	after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier. 	it gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from 	a set of 70. exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work 	you do - data entry, word processing, information processing. 	exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on 	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does. 	chb includes hypertext information on rsi that you can use 	to learn more about rsi and how to prevent it. other information 	on non-rsi topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer. 	a full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included. 	chb can be run in a dos box under windows, but does not then 	warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear 	useful when used with windows. 	cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses. comments: 	the keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better 	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to 	measure clock time or even typing time. the marketing stuff 	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers, 	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company 	to pay up for rsi management tools. tool: eyercise (commercial software) available from: 	ran enterprises 	one woodland park dr. 	haverhill, ma 01830, us 	tel: 800-451-4487 (us only) platforms: windows (3.0/3.1), os/2 pm (1.3/2.0) [not dos] description: 	aimed at preventing rsi and eye strain, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). optionally 	displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are 	animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the 	correct rate. includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training 	exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions 	you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes. also includes online help 	on workplace ergonomics. 	quote from their literature: 	"eyercise is a windows program that breaks up your day with periodic 	sets of stretches and visual training exercises. the stretches work 	all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent 	repetitive strain injury. the visual training exercises will improve 	your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain. together these 	help you to become more relaxed and productive." 	"the package includes the book _computers & visual stress_ by edward c. 	godnig, o.d. and john s. hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup 	for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to 	promote healthy and efficient computer use. 	 	cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts 	for resellers. free demo ($5 outside us). comments: 	i have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: i would say 	it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management, because it 	does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes. also, it 	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which 	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day. worked ok on 	windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a uae - not sure 	why. also refused to work with the space bar on one pc, and has 	one window without window controls. very usable though, and does not 	require any sound hardware. tool: lifeguard (commercial software) available from: 	visionary software 	p.o. box 69447 	portland, or 97201, us 	tel: +1 (503) 246-6200 platforms: mac, dos (windows version underway) description: 	aimed at preventing rsi. warns you to take a break 	with dialog box and sound. includes a list of exercises 	to do during breaks, and information on configuring your 	workstation in an ergonomic manner. price: $59; 	quantity discounts and site licenses. the dos product is 	bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how 	equivalent this is to the mac version. 	 	the mac version got a good review in desktop publisher 	magazine (feb 1991). good marketing stuff with useful 	2-page summaries of rsi problems and solutions, with 	references. tool: stressfree (commercial software, free usable demo) available from: 	lifetime software 	p.o. box 87522 	houston 	texas 77287-7522, us 	tel: 800-947-2178 (us only) 	fax: +1 (713) 474-2067 	mail: 70412.727@compuserve.com 	demo (working program but reduced functions) available from: 	 compuserve: windows advanced forum, new uploads section, or 			health and fitness forum, issues at work section. 	 anon ftp: ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites) platforms: windows (3.0/3.1) (mac and dos versions underway) description: 	aimed at preventing rsi, this program warns you to take 	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). 	displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are 	animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the 	correct rate. quite a few exercises, can configure which ones 	are included to some extent. online help. 	version 2.0 is out soon, mac and dos versions will be based 	on this. 	cost: $29.95 if support via compuserve or internet, otherwise $39.95. site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. 	 (note: prices may have gone up for v2.0). comments: 	i have had a play with this, and it works ok. its user interface 	design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual. 	expensive tool around and it does the job. it is also the only 	tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it 	on your local bulletin boards, ftp servers and bitnet servers! 	does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics, but it does 	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, 	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises. tool: typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (october 1992) available from: 	email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk 	anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar platforms: unix (tested on sco, sunos, mach; character and x window mode) description: 	this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you 	to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously 	typing. it does not provide exercises, but it does check 	that you really do take a break, and tells you when you 	can start typing again. 	typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing 	today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you 	know how much you *really* type. it also logs information 	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out. 	the warning message appears on your screen (in character mode), 	in a pop-up window (for x windows), or as a zephyr message 	(for those with athena stuff). tim freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> 	has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for 	x, zephyr and mach. 	not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk 	(for sco, sunos, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for mach, 	x window mode, zephyr) if you have problems or want to give 	feedback. tool: various calendar / batch queue programs available from: 	various sources platforms: various description: 	any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming 	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool. 	or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit 	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to 	the screen. 	using windows as an example: create a calendar file, and 	include this filename in your win.ini's 'load=' line so 	you get it on every startup of windows. suppose you 	want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am. 	press f7 (special time...) to enter an appointment, enter 	9:30, hit enter, and type some text in saying what the break 	is for. then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat 	for the next appointment. 	by using windows recorder, you can record the keystrokes 	that set up breaks throughout a day in a .rec file. put this 	file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with 	a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments 	with rsi exercises. 	the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. 	an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job 	that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will 	depend a lot on your operating system. 	while these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing 	yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable rsi 	management tool. if you are techie enough you might want to 	write a version of typewatch (see above) for your operating 	system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best. tool: digital watches with count-down timers available from: 	various sources, e.g. casio bp-100. description: 	many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable 	number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either 	manually or automatically. 	while these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you 	are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from 	a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi. the great 	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you 	are doing. 	 comments: 	my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to 	my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which 	actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left 	arm improved. getting a count-down timer watch has been 	very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day. 	i have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but 	these are not much good because they do not give an audible 	warning of the end of the time period! keyboard remapping tools: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. one-handed typing tools may help, but be very careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse. tool: hsh (public domain) available from: 	anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar platforms: unix (don't know which ones) description: 	allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. 	only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or 	an xterm, but not most x programs). tool: dvorak keyboard tools (various) available from: 	anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c 	also built into windows 3.x. description: 	the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout 	that involves more balanced hand use. it *may* help prevent 	rsi a bit, but you can also use it if you have rsi, since 	it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-) -- dan wallach "one of the most attractive features of a connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces office#: 510-642-9585 of its cabinet." -- cm paris ref. manual, v6.0, p48.

(this does >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective. it *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) first of all, i think you are arguing against a straw man, because i don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional chinese medicine should be accepted as science. i, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky. what some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention. if in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist. for all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed. it is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies. it is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly. but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist. this attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet

here's the theory. normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers. when you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow. by the time you're exerting 50% of your full power, you're completely restricting your blood flow. without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain. once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load. this makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion. more tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues. another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves. they need blood too. anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through. stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse. --- specific injuries you may have heard of: (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic. acute injuries are severely painful and noticable. chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.) tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath. chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability to lubricate the tendon. as a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and you've got your problem. tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon. repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation. eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain. "sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity. carpal tunnel syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them. symptoms include feeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. cts is often confused for a diffuse condition. adverse mechanical tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders. it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy). others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for a way to injure it. by now, you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why. just be careful: many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem. always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery). ==4== typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons. this requires learning how to relax. if you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important. tune out the world and breath deep and regular. relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break. every three minutes, take a three second break. really, do it every three minutes. it's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax. if you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this. rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal. there are all kinds of other treatments, of course. drugs can reduce inflamation and pain. custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture. surgery can fix some problems. exercise can help strengthen your muscles. regular stretching can help prevent injury. good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension. ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling. only your doctor can say what's best for you. --- posture -- here are some basic guidelines. [i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i'm lifting it almost verbatim from appendix 10. -- dwallach] . let your shoulders relax. . let your elbows swing free. . keep your wrists straight. . pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward. . keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . try leaning back in the chair. . don't slouch or slump forward. . alter your posture from time to time. . every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward. set the seat height, first. your feet should be flat on the floor. there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much. now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at. if you are short, this may be impossible. the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest. now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan. the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area. if you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available. [now, i diverge a little from the text] a good chair makes a big difference. if you don't like your chair, go find a better one. you really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt. most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way. you should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you. in the san francisco bay area, i highly recommend "just chairs." the name says it all. --- keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements: there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right. for some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders. however, with good posture, you shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be "right there". if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees. of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs. wrist pads may or may not help at this. you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax. it's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands. some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed. a number of replacements are available, on the market, today. check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail. ==5== requests for more info clearly, the above information is incomplete. the typing-injury archive is incomplete. there's always more information out there. if you'd like to submit something, please send me mail, and i'll gladly throw it in. if you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful! i'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors. i'd love somebody to make a list of doctors. i'd love somebody to edit the above sections, looking for places where i've obviously goofed. ==6== references i completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful guide produced in new zealand by their occupational safety & health service, a service of their department of labour. special thanks to the authors: wigley, turner, blake, darby, mcinnes, and harding. semi-bibliographic reference: . occupational overuse syndrome . treatment and rehabilitation: a practitioner's guide published by the occupational safety and health service department of labour wellington, new zealand. first edition: june 1992 isbn 0-477-3499-3 price: $9.95 (new zealand $'s, of course) thanks to richard donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk> for reviewing this posting. -- dan wallach "one of the most attractive features of a connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces office#: 510-642-9585 of its cabinet." -- cm paris ref. manual, v6.0, p48.

(no, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window. at least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.) the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. it depends on the quality of their thinking. it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies. and it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. and i'm especially offended by russell turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes. simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet

hello, i am planning on attending podiatry school next year. i have narrowed my choices to the pennsylvania college of podiatric medicine, in philadelphia, or the california college of podiatric medicine in san francisco. if anyone has any information or oppinions about these two schools, please tell me. i am having a hard time deciding which one to attend, and must make a decision very soon. thank you, larry ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ live from new york, it's saturday night... tonight's special guest: lawrence silverberg from the state university of new york @ albany aka:ls8139@gemini.albany.edu ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what i am going to describe here. i have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on november 3, 1992 at 6:45am after eating kellog's frosted flakes. she is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family. all the tests (eeg, mri, ekg) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again. well, we were going along fine and the other morning, april 5, she had a bowl of another kellog's frosted kind of cereal, fruit loops (i am embarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every once in a while...) so i pour it in her bowl and think "oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure." ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. this was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure. when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea. now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head. once again her eeg looks normal which i understand can happen even when a person has a seizure. once again we are waiting. i have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing. i know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being. anyway, as you can guess, i am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has. sorry to be so wordy but i wanted to really get across what is going on here. thanks. -- sharon paulson s.s.paulson@larc.nasa.gov nasa langley research center bldg. 1192d, mailstop 156 work: (804) 864-2241 hampton, virginia. 23681 home: (804) 596-2362

here is a press release from the natural resources defense council. new data show about 100 major u.s. water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee-type disease outbreak to: national desk, environment writer contact: erik olson or sarah silver, 202-783-7800, both of the natural resources defense council washington, april 14 -- internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from boston to san francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee. the epa list is attached. "these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration," said erik olson, a senior attorney with nrdc. "water contamination isn't just a problem in bangladesh, it's also a problem in bozeman and boston." "as of june 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on epa's list probably will be breaking the law. the 1986 safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution," olson continued. some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline. olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities. a 1991 survey of 66 u.s. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia. adding to the level of concern, a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems. "this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink. we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public," olson noted. "the time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink." nrdc is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization. systems epa indicates require filtration and do not adequately protect watersheds connecticut bridgeport bridgeport hydraulic co. massachusetts boston h2o resource author (mwra) medford mwra-medford water dept melrose mwra-melrose water dept hilton mwra-hilton water dept needham mwra-needham water division newtoncenter mwra-newton water dept. marblehead mwra-marblehead water dept quincy mwra-quincy water dept norwood mwra-norwood water dept framingham mwra-framingham water div cambridge mwra-cambridge water dept canton mwra-canton water div-dpw chelsea mwra-chelsea water dept everett mwra-everett water dept lexington mwra-201 bedford (puo wrks) lynn mwra-lynn water & sewer co malden mwra-malden water division revere mwra-revere water dept woburn mwra-woburn water dept swampscott mwra-swampscott water dept saugus mwra-saugus water dept somerville mwra-somerville water dept stoneman mwra-stoneman water dept brookline mwra-brookline water dept wakefield mwra-same as above waltham mwra-waltham water division watertown mwra-watertown water division weston mwra-weston water dept dedham mwra-dedham-westwood district winchester mwra-winchester water & sewer winthrop mwra-winthrop water dept boston mwra-boston water & sewer co s. hadley mwra-south hadley fire dist arlington mwra-arlington water dept belmont mwra-belmont water dept clinton mwra-clinton water dept attleboro attleboro water dept fitchburg fitchburg water dept northampton northampton water dept north adams north adams water dept amherst amherst water division dpw gardner gardner water dept worcester worcester dpw, water oper westboro westboro water dept southbridge southbridge water supply co newburyport newburyport water dept hingham hingham water co brockton brockton water dept maine rockland camden & rockland water co bath bath water district new hampshire keene city of keene salem salem water dept vermont barre city barre city water system rutland city rutland city water dept new york glens falls glens falls city yorktown hts yorktown water storage & dist rochester rochester city henrietta henrietta wd rochester mcwa upland system rochester greece consolidated new york nyc-aquaduct sys (croton) chappaqua new castle/stanwood wd beacon beacon city mamaronek westchester joint water works pennsylvania bethlehem bethlehem public water sys johnstown greater johnstown water auth lock haven city of lock haven-water dept shamokin roaring creek water comp harrisburg harrisburg city hazleton hazleton city water dept wind gap blue mt consolidated apollo westmoreland auth fayettville guilford water auth humlock creek pg&w-ceasetown reservoir springbrook pg&w-waters reservoir wilkes barre pg&w-gardners creek wilkes barre pg&w-hill creek wilkes barre pg&w-plymouth relief altoona altoona city auth tamaqua tamaqua municipal water waynesboro waynesboro borough auth pottsville schuykill co mun auth virginia covington city of covington fishersville south river sa dist-acsa south carolina greenville greenville water sys michigan sault ste marie sault ste marie marquette marquette montana butte butte water co bozeman bozeman city california san francisco city & county of san fran nevada reno westpac idaho twin falls twin falls city washington aberdeen aberdeen water dept centralia centralia water dept -30- -- nigel allen, toronto, ontario, canada ndallen@r-node.hub.org

we were talking about migraine and exercise (i'm the one who can't fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...). anyway, turning the thread around, the other day i played tennis during my lunch hour. i'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise. i got overheated, and dehydrated. afterwards, i noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, i could feel a migraine start. (i continued to drink water in the afternoon.) i took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided. this isn't the first time that i've had a migraine occur after exercise. i'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and i wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?). i'm not giving up tennis so is there anything i can do (besides get into shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this? thanks, -- ********************************************************************** janet jakstys uucp:{ames,mcdcup}!ntmtv!janet northern telecom internet:janet@ntmtv.com mtn. view, ca. **********************************************************************

if the nose culture shows staph, then ceftin or even ceclor are better. suprax does not kill staph. treating bacterial infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant strains. some 60% of hemophilus influenza strains are now resistant. what works for me and my organisms may not work for you and yours. keep experimenting. 	 ken colby

(some would give velikovsky or korzybski as examples. if you don't like these, choose your own.) i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi. both einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this. let me approach this from a second direction. when one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make. one kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed. another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting. the first difference is the one that i have been pointing to. the second difference is the one that lee lady seems to be discussing. > if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit > to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. > but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science. this > is where you and i disagree with turpin. i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies. similarly, i suspect that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi. > ... in order to have science, one must have a theoretical > structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically > validated random hypotheses. certainly a "theoretical structure that makes sense" is the goal. in areas where we do not yet have this, i see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses. let's face it: we cannot always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything clear for us. sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. russell

(i wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. i don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology. and it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.) 2) science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence. most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks. the theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done. overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done. what keeps it going forward is the critical function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated. the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test. the generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly. pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid. pasteur's irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result. this is where lysenko, creationists, etc. fail. they have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything. when their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists). -- mark a. fulk			university of rochester computer science department	fulk@cs.rochester.edu

avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable. however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. and in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder. in the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house. in science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries. usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty. if 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since they lacked the concept of a limit. and in fact, because of the lack of a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz. nonetheless, what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made. in article <1993apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com (dick king) writes: > [ somebody writes: ] >>i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology. .... > .... >he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a >universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not. > .... >einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out >there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them. these are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology. according to these posters "if it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science." taken to the extreme, i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science. for one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing. (i don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology. nonetheless, it is one of the results.) and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results, i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile. furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science: choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance. for instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology. in my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin's assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.") i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science. (ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.) and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet

a friend of mine has been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago. the psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not. ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now. my friend is now taking meclomen (another nsaid) but this isn't helping control the pain at all. in the past two months my friend has also started taking azulfadine along with the nsaid medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months. as a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping. staying in one position too long is an ordeal. another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs). the tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it. the latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending prednisone. the hope is that the prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis. my friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine). if anyone is aware of any new treatments for psoriatic arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, i would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me. if anyone is interested, i'll post a summary to this newsgroup. thanks in advance, donna dmp@fig.citib.com

i love the faq. the comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after rk and possibly after prk is interresting. why is this? does anyone know for sure whether this applies to prk as well? also, why is it possible to get a correction in prk with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth, while rk is done to a depth of up to 95%? why such a difference? i thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in prk. i must not be understanding all of the differences. in the faq, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone. if this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they can be worn afterall!). it is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision. the first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which glasses couldn't help. would not help. -- | daniel r. field, aka infospunj | i'm just a lowly phlebe. | | dfield@oboe.calpoly.edu | | | biochemistry, biotechnology | i'm at the phlebottom | | california polytechnic state u | of the medical totem pole. |

(though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. if experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication. this is what leads one (ala feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.) true, the generation part *can* be totally irrational. but typically it is *not*. anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science. -- gary h. merrill [principal systems developer, c compiler development] sas institute inc. / sas campus dr. / cary, nc 27513 / (919) 677-8000 sasghm@theseus.unx.sas.com ... !mcnc!sas!sasghm

(simple example: warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments. he got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes. this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays. the result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome. unfortunately for warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome. on the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created. other species have different sets of transposons. fortunately for me, warren and i used to eat dinner at t.g.i. fridays all the time.) >it further at least implicitly advances the position that >sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the >context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational >and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then >weeded out via the "critical function" of science. i'm not sure that it's random. but there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses. if you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have. if they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. if you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere. >(though why this critical >function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces. then we get varieties of pathological science: lysenko, mirsky's opposition to dna-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth. >if experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are >subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true >of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication. >this is what leads one (ala feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.) i don't agree that this follows. in fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which i disagree with feyerabend. it is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process. failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out. another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''. i'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design. alexander fleming (proc. royal soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme. >true, the generation part *can* be totally irrational. but typically it is >*not*. anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have >resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply >do not generalize well to the actual history of science. it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational. perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds. the main examples i can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole. -- mark a. fulk			university of rochester computer science department	fulk@cs.rochester.edu

can anyone help me find any information on the drug prozac? i am writing a report on the inventors , eli lilly and co., and the product. i need as much help as i can get. thanks a lot, adriana gilmete.
i need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me. i saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. he suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that i need to call him 7 days after i begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health. i did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary). i explained to her that i was following up at the doctor's request, and that i was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective. the doctor called me back, and his first words were, "whatever you want, you'd better make it quick. i'm very busy and don't have time to chit- chat with you!" i told him i was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him, and that i was feeling worse. i then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time. he responded, "just spit it out now because no time is a good time." (said in a raised voice.) i started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and i kind of stuttered and then said "well, never mind" and he said he'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time. this doctor called me that evening and said because i didn't express myself well, he was confused about what i wanted. at this point i was pretty upset and i told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry i felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings. he told me that he just doesn't have time to "rap with patients" and thought that was what i wanted. i told him that to assume i was calling to "rap" was insulting, and said again that i was just following through on his orders. he responded that he resented the implication that he felt i was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status. he then gave me this apology: "i am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought i was insulting. i am not trying to insult you but i am not that knowledgeable about pain, and i don't have a lot of time to deal with that." he then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication. i am still upset and have not yet called. my questions: (1) should i continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) since i am in pain off and on, i realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am i perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? if this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain i have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but now i am afraid to call him. 			--marlena

the subject-line says it: every time i run a fever, i get an amazing rosy rash over my torso and arms. fortunately, it doesn't itch. the rash always comes on the day after the fever breaks and no matter what the illness was: cold, flu, whatever. it started happening about four years ago after i moved to my current town, although i don't know if that has anything to do with anything. severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever: a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash. a mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster. anybody know what might be causing this? it's no more than an embarassment, but i'd be curious to know what's going on. am i carrying some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out its competition? jim jones

(on the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study" to alleviate our skepticism.) rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things. (to reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.) russell

intensive japanese at the university of pittsburgh this summer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the university of pittsburgh is offering two intensive japanese language courses this summer. both courses, intensive elementary japanese and intensive intermediate japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of japanese language study. they begin june 7 and end august 13. the courses meet five days per week, five hours per day. there is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course. fellowships available for science and engineering students. contact steven brener, program manager of the japanese science and technology management program, at the university of pittsburgh at the number or address below. all interested individuals are encouraged to apply, this is not limited to university students. ####################################################################### ################# new program announcement ######################## ####################################################################### japanese science and technology management program the japanese science and technology management program (jstmp) is a new program jointly developed by the university of pittsbugh and carnegie mellon university. students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in june 1993 and january 1994. program objectives the program intends to promote technology transfer between japan and the united states. it is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the japanese proceed with technological development. this is facilitated by extended internships in japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their japanese counterparts. program design to fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of japan and its culture. correspondingly, jstmp consists of three major components: 1. training in the japanese language several japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time. 2. education in japanese business and social culture a particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology. courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including anthropology, sociology, history, and political science. moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted. further, a field trip to japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the united states will be scheduled. 3. an internship or a study mission in japan upon completion of their language and cultural training at pitt and cmu, participants will have the opportunity to go to japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology. internships in japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible. fellowships covering tuition for language and culture courses, as well as stipends for living expenses are available. for more information and application materials contact steven brener				susie brown jstmp					carnegie mellon university, gsia university of pittsburgh		pittsburgh, pa 15213-3890 4e25 forbes quadrangle			telephone: (412) 268-7806 pittsburgh, pa 15260			fax:	 (412) 268-8163 telephone: (412) 648-7414		 fax: (412) 648-2199		 ############################################################################ ############################################################################ interested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or mail. please do not inquire via e-mail. please note that this is directed at grads and professionals, however, advanced undergrads will be considered. further, funding is resticted to us citizens and permanent residents of the us. steve brener
you may want to inquire about taking lupron as a medication. it's supposed to be a new treatment, and it's described in nov. 1992 issue of j. of obst. and gyn. lupron is taken as a monthly injection, whereas other drugs such as danazol are taken daily as pills.

[from kalat, j.w.. (1992): _biological psychology_. wadsworth publishing co. belmont, ca. pg. 219. reproduced without permission.] digression 6.1: miracle berries and the modification of taste receptors although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to west africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances. miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (bartoshuk, gentile, moskowitz, & meiselman, 1974). if you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and i do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids (which are normally sour) will taste sweet. they will continue to taste sour as well. miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the united states as a diet aid. the idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances. such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories. a colleague and i once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. we drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar. all tasted extremely sweet. somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are. we awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

i posted this to sci.psychology on april 3, and after seeing your post here on panice disorder thought it would be relevant. ----- my research indicates that two schools of thought exist. the literature promoting medication says it's the superior treatment. not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior. what are the facts? early in my research i didn't have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy. i was interested in a treatment that worked. after reading journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out rate, and no side effects associated with medication. lars-goran ost published an excellent article titled "applied relaxation: description of a coping technique and a review of controlled studies." this is from behav. res. ther., vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987. the article provides instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (ar). briefly, you start with two 15 minute sessions daily, and progress in 8-12 weeks to performing 10-15 thirty second sessions daily. i'll snail mail this article to anyone interested (usa only please; international please pay for postage). mark vonwaadn@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu

a friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information. a few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out. she would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old). it continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar. since that time, she has gotten two more bald spots of the same size. other symptoms she's described include: several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue. she went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems. he did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal. she's very concerned and very confused. does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? i told her that i thought she should see an endocrinologist. does that sound like the right idea? ** by the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out. thanks in advance for any help!

(i've heard of people taking fiber pills. it seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference. it would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills. tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.) my "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me. eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so i don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else. i don't eat when i'm not hungry (unless i'm sure i'll get hungry shortly, and eating won't be practical then). i bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round. fast. i also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as i've never owned a car. i estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day. it also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism. (even so, my metabolism is so low that when i'm at rest i'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (f), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.) cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce. (cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others. but it's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.) there's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat. fortunately, it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health. obviously, i can't swear that every obese person who does what i've done will have the success i did. but i've never yet heard of one who did try it and didn't succeed. > i think all of us cycle. one's success depends on how large the > fluctuations in the cycle are. some people can cycle only 5 pounds. i'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat. i usually eat extremely little salt. when i do eat something salty, my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds. it comes off again over a week or two. -- keith lynch, kfl@access.digex.com f p=2,3:2 s q=1 x "f f=3:2 q:f*f>p!'q s q=p#f" w:q p,?$x\8+1*8

i remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring from the diet. the theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these chemicals than other people. i don't remember any connection being made with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.
phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine. it can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage. an odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine. people with the condition must avoid nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything else rich in phenylalanine. aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms. pat robertson's program _the_700_club_ was beating the drum against aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so. apparently, the evidence is not very strong, or pat would still be flailing away.

nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar. some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet. it is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances. the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells. all i can say is that i will not consume it. phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about. it is an amino acid, and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body. some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body. for them, it will accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells. therefore, it is only a major problem in young children (until around age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder. it used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child, or when pregnant. -heather

my family doctor and the physiotherapist (pt) she sent me to agree that the pain in my left shoulder is bursitis. i have an appointment with an orthpod (i love that, it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while i'm waiting the pt is treating me. she's using hot packs, ultrasound, and lasers, but there's no improvement yet. in fact, i almost suspect it's getting worse. my real question is about the laser treatment. i can't easily imagine what the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem. can anyone shed some light (so to speak) on the matter? -- robert allison ottawa, ontario canada

this will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter of the long island chapter of the transplant recipients international organization (trio). unfortunately, i was unable to post it before the date of this month's meeting. i'm posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be useful or illustrative. also, i hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation. mike transplant recipients international organization long island chapter p.o. box 922 huntington, ny 11743-0922		 newsletter 516/421-3258 april 1993 volume iv no. 8 next meeting the next meeting is wednesday april 14 at 8 pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor, 517 uniondale avenue in uniondale. our guest speaker will be dr. lewis teperman. dr. teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr. starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center. dr. teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions. he is a long time friend of trio, surgeon to many of our members, and always a gracious and delightful guest. it is sure to be a very informative, interesting and engaging evening. our hospitality committee, bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be cooperative. we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr. teperman. wednesday april 14 k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance. no tv weatherman can match us. this time we not only scored again, but we were also able to disable the long island railroad, making travel really difficult. none the less, many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation. our scheduled speaker, mrs. elizabeth linnehan, a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not able to attend. she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications. however, ms. jennifer friedman, an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice. ms. friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take. we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening. annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr. teperman, the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter. this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by-laws. the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term. the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board. anne (liver recipient) and don treffeisen robert (heart recipient) and eulene smith vito (kidney recipient) and bette suglia kay grenzig (liver recipient) jan schichtel (kidney recipient) larry juliano (kidney recipient) david bekofsky (director public education litp) those remaining on the board for another year are: robert carroll (liver, kidney & pancreas recipient) jerry (kidney recipient) and jeanne eichhorn ron (kidney donor) and marie healy peter smith (bone marrow recipient) patricia ann yankus (kidney and pancreas recipient) walter ruzak (kidney recipient) this may seem to be a big board, but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board. therefore, in addition to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also be accepted from the floor. there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work. in addition, brief treasurer's and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business, suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up. we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr. teperman. future meetings remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year. may 12 dr. peter shaprio, chief of psychiatry columbia presbyterian medical center june 9 dr. felix rappaport, director of the stony brook kidney transplant program. plan on being with us the second wednesday of each month. notdaw the week of april 18-24 is national organ and tissue donor awareness week. notdaw. while we are planning news releases, speaking engagements and meetings with supervisors gullata and gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year's experience with miserable weather. we all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. we have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon. attached to this newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use. thank you. dr. starzl to be honored the long island chapter of the american liver foundation will hold its annual auction and dinner dance on may 7th at the fountainbleu on jericho turnpike in jericho. dr. thomas starzl will be the honored guest. tickets are $50 person and are going fast. if you'd like to meet dr. starzl, call anne treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details. membership news congratulations to al reese. al received his heart transplant in pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years. he is home and doing well after only 12 days in hospital. arthur michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the boston marathon in april. what fantastic proof that transplantation works! we hope the national press notices. bob mccormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his transplanted kidney removed. he is home now, back on dialysis and feeling better. nicole healy, kidney recipient and daughter of ron and marie, spent the past several weeks in hospital in miami with problems encountered on vacation. marie has been with her in florida. they are back in new york where nicole's treatment will continue. we wish nicole a speedy recovery. kay grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. kay is a candidate for the board so we need her well soon. and best wishes to all coming out of the flu. it was a tough winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow. see you......wednesday april 14 8 pm k of c

(to >reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from >uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical >problems are notoriously problematic.) okay, so let's see if we agree on this: first of all, there are degrees of certainty. it might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain treatment. on the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful. this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. in this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing. secondly, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about nlp (neurolinguistic programming). much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research. for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library). not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the nlp methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest. and most especially to be aware of the *questions* nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation. over and over again the response i get in sci.pychology is "if this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us." to me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "there've got to be controlled studies" position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia/trauma cure. simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one. the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes. (nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating post-traumatic stress syndrome.) it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists. a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of ptsd, once for each traumatic incident). the process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home. now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. (especially if, as nlpers claim, the success rate is extremely high.) take someone with a fear of heights (as i used to have). take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response. spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization. send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed. check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting. (more long term follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance. in any case, there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years. to the best of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks.) (my own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different nlp technique, before i learned of the fast phobia/trauma cure. ten years later now, i enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.) the folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test. they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that nlp practitioners, many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill afford to do. (most of them are also just plain not interested, because the whole idea seems frivolous. and since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance.) the fast phobia/trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying "we don't have any way of knowing that it's effective." these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want, of course, but they say "why should i prove your theory?" and "the burden of proof is on the one making the claim." one academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific journal. (it's described in a number of books and i've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as i'm capable of.) actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. to me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it. this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about "doctrinnaire" attitudes about science. now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, russell. if so, i apologize. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet

this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw. today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot! he used a strange technique i'd never seen before. he took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges. in the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea, and a few cloves. on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it. the lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes. later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts. what surprises and concerns me are: 1) no wood chips. where does the smoke flavor come from? 2) about 5 or 10 years ago, i remember hearing that carmel color (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring agent) had been found to be carcinogenic. i believe they injected it under the skin of rats, or something. if the results were conclusive, caramel color would not be legal in the u.s., yet it is still being used. was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what? 3) about 5 or 10 years ago, i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit). does anyone know whatever happened with that story? if it were carcinogenic, earl grey tea could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do so. wrt natural wood smoke (i've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), i've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing. i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips. my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar. the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind. does anyone know if my theory is correct? i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic. for that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, i only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals. i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat. i have a long rectangular weber, and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end. the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals. and yet another reason i've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic. i'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others. an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal, when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide (edb) into the cake mix to suppress weevils. this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic. the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks. what a great analogy! when i first heard that, my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit! one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 duncans!

[...] in the september 1992 issue of the tufts university diet and nutrition letter, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners. what follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with nutrasweet. [reproduced without permission] 	 the controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in england, 	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under 	the tradename nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and, 	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if 	a person simply consumed sugar. when researchers asked a group 	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and 	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after 	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. 	 the study received widespread media attention and stirred a 	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. 	however, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers 	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did 	actually translate into an increase in eating. the two do not 	necessarily go hand in hand. 	 in the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining 	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. 	and after reviewing every one of them, the director of the 	laboratory of the study of human ingestive behavior at johns hopkins 	university, barbara rolls, ph.d., concluded that consuming aspartame- 	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in 	the amount of food eaten afterward. 	 one artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing 	cancer is aspartame. but it most certainly has been blamed for a 	host of other ills. since its introduction in 1981, the government 	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing 	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. 	still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and 	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm 	that it can bring about adverse health effects. that's why the 	centers for disease control (the government agency charged with 	monitoring public health), the american medical association's 	council on scientific affairs, and the food and drug administration 	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a 	clean bill of health. 	 granted, the fda has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of 	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight. to exceed 	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take 	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of 	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt, 	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,... 	a 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams 	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups 	of yogurt -- to go over the limit. [chart with aspartame content 	of selected foods omitted] 	 only one small group of people must be certain to stay away 	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called 	phenylketonuria, or pku. the estimated one person in every 12,000 	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential 	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine. once a child 	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause 	such severe problems as mental retardation. to help people with 	pku avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other 	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "phenylketonurics: 	contains phenylalanine." -rich young (these are not kodak's opinions.)
i have a friend who has a very pronounced slouch of his upper back. he always walks and sits this way so i have concluded that he is hunchback. is this a genetic disorder, or is it something that people can correct. i.e. is it just bad posture that can be changed with a bit of will power? isabelle.rosso@dartmouth.edu
ks> from: keith@actrix.gen.nz (keith stewart) ks>my wife has become interested through an acquaintance in post-polio syndrome ks>this apparently is not recognised in new zealand and different symptons ( eg ks>chest complaints) are treated separately. does anone have any information i'm not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on. post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, emg, and muscle biopsy. the abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration. clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance. the examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy. the emg shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials). the biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy. post-polio patients do not have als. in als, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next. in post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next. of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine als, but als is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio. the cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown. there is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen. there is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. both groups can have the same emg and biopsy findings. the reason for these "acute" changes in a "chronic" disease (old polio) is unknown. possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years. there are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration. the pps patients are more likely to have had severe polio. the pps patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. they also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests. my take on this (i'm sure some will disagree): after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures. the increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and adl. i am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a pps patient who was not limited in some way by pain. i do not believe that pps patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-pps patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without pps complaints). --- . slmr 2.1 . e-mail: jim.zisfein@factory.com (jim zisfein)
dn> from: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (david nye) dn> briefly, this is a condition in which patients who have significant dn> residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the dn> weakness as they get older. one theory is that the remaining motor dn> neurons have to work harder and so die sooner. if this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy (evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't. instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers. this is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly denervated muscle. --- . slmr 2.1 . e-mail: jim.zisfein@factory.com (jim zisfein)

in article <ls8lnvinnrtb@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (russell turpin) writes: > ... >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective. it *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.) to start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible. so there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context. insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible. (expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.) on the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false. there is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying "you people call this science?" (my opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.) some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation. i don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science. my second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards. i think this is true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific. within mathematics, i think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century. one conspicuous case is that of riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove. (later mathematicians did prove them, of course.) i think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not as it is a matter of convincing other people. (people have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here, but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element. not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process, but i think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.) when a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, i think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation. in article <c53by5.hd@news.hawaii.edu> i wrote: > namely, is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches? admittedly, my question was not at all well posed. a considerable amount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as i suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer. the "science" i was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century. i certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of "reason and observation." one thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies. since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet

as promised, below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog. i am very pleased with the results. the catalog description is as follows: 	the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager 	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a 	professional shiatsu masseur. the powerful motor drives two 	counter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits -- 	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms. 	pressure point massager a2623 $109 to order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021. ******** note: when i ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109. when i received it, i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one. i was quite annoyed to see a $70 difference in price. i called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same. he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return. in fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (i received this one in 3 days), he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives, then return the old one. very reasonable people. ******** i have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if i were a building, i would be described as "structurally unsound :-) ). i have stretches and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away. if, for whatever reason, i do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, more prone to further strain. even with exercise, i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t. the tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye. when my physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged. i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, not vibrate, my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past, that i could use by myself. no doctor visit or inconvenient p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it. i could get up in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary. i have been using it for about a week or so now, and love it. the base unit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet. the two metal "thumbs" are about 1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base. the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable. they are located more toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below). they move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet. it can be used from either side. for instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it. _______________________________ | __ _______________ __ | | | | |		| | | | | | | | \^^/ \^^/ | | | | | | | | || || | | | | | | | |		| | | | | | | |_______________| | | | | |__|			 |__| | |_______________________________| for the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs. the handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists. since my wrists are also impaired (i'm typing this over an extended period of time), and i don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works well for me. for my back, i sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it. the pressure of leaning back holds it in place. if i want to massage the entire spine, i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it. for my back, this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them). the tennis balls are better than nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if i don't pin it up first. as far as i'm concerned, the easier something like this is to use, the more likely i'll use/do it. if there are multiple considerations/hassles, i'm more likely to not bother with it. not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased. the first time i used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, i overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days. i laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped. after that, i was more gradual about applying pressure. at this point, the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged. i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back, which is the most vulnerable point for me. it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out. i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although i cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since i've had it such a short time. i plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also to loosen the muscls before exercising (and maybe after, too). i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this was very timely for me. this is the 1st product i've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker. the catalog states they have been in business since 1976. it contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do. definitely a step above some other ones i've seen such as "dr. leonards health care catalog" or "mature wisdom". i'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ). i consider many of those products to be rip-offs, particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits. i apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _i_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail. robin coutellier northern telecom, mountain view, ca internet:

i know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or even gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and the doctor administering it. is there also an anti-placebo effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the medicine? is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a medicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees more improvement than there is? if so, what is this effect called? is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than there is? what would this effect be called? have these effects ever been studied? how common are these effects? thank you in advance for all replies. ... information is very valuable but dis-information is much more common.
hi, i am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if i'm way off the mark. on 19.3.93 my wife went to her general practitioner (doctor). he mentioned an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. he had read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again. the article was about whiplash injury/cervical pain. it mentions the use of a mri (magnetic resonance imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain. this article is most likely in an australian medical journal. i very much want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case matches my wife. we would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter via email preferably. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- gavin anderson email: ganderson@cmutual.com.au analyst/programmer. phone: +61-3-607-6299 colonial mutual life aust.

from my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature, i think that the benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to other kinds of risks. (this type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan grilling.) one possible remedy i have read about is to take some vitamin c with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.). this may make sense because vit. c is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the chemicals in question. bon apetit! -- sanford silverman >opinions expressed here are my own< american cyanamid sandy@pt.cyanamid.com, silvermans@pt.cyanamid.com "yeast is best"
following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (the theory as i understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a "foreign" body. where this blocking is deficient, the body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. the white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) following the transfusion, she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk. we're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including the obgyn who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies. is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this? thanks...gene (and jane and jake) p.s. i've also posted this in misc.kids.

my wife and i are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due june 15th). we interviewed a young doctor last week and were very impressed with her. however, i discovered that she is actually not an medical doctor (m.d.) but rather a "doctor of osteopathy" (d.o.). what's the difference? i believe the pediatrician *i* went to for many years was a d.o. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor i've seen over the years. my dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery." jeez, this sounds like chiropractic. i remember getting shots and medicine from *my* pediatrician d.o., and don't remember any "manipulative techniques". perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real, practical difference between an m.d. and a d.o. also, i'm interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who follows one or the other medical philosophy. readers of sci.med: please respond directly to sbrenner@attmail.com; i do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response if you just post it here. sorry for the cross-posting, but i'm hoping there's some expertise here. a t d h v a a n n k c s e ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ scott d. brenner at&t consumer communications services sbrenner@attmail.com basking ridge, new jersey ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered. it had produced a dull pain in that area. the hernia was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a "plug and patch". the doctor considered the procedure a success. a few months later the same pain returned. the doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair. now the pain occurs more often. my gp couldn't identify any specific problem. the surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time. my question to the net: is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else? steve heffner

-*---- i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly. my definition is this: science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work. lee lady writes: > i don't think that science should be defined in a way that some > of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely > thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as > scientific work. unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a mistake, they fall under my definition. i hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific. in article <c5nasf.mh7@news.hawaii.edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu (lee lady) writes: > seriously, i'm not sure whether i misjudged you or not, in one respect. > i still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science > is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ... here is where i think we are talking at cross-purposes. it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what "science is mainly about." consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone. this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about. one can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc. in short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are "mainly about." the misunderstanding here is my fault. i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition. > okay, so let's see if we agree on this: first of all, there are degrees > of certainty. it might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully > controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the > extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain > treatment. on the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even > if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that > a treatment is useful. ... > > secondly, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of > evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal. i agree on both counts. as an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls. as to the first, i do not think it is useful to talk about "absolute scientific truth." i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable. the latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence. one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others. it is perfectly alright to speculate. i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right. but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems. often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work. (it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.) > the folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to > make this simple test. they claim that only an elaborate outcome study > will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that nlp practitioners, > many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill > afford to do. (most of them are also just plain not interested, because > the whole idea seems frivolous. and since they're not part of the > scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain > from scientific acceptance.) i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness. when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds. this is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy. on the other hand, i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research. as gordon banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's rhine. > one academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't > been described in a scientific journal. ... i think this is absurd. > actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done > (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because > it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal. i wonder why the results were not published. in my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals. often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.

there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. humans are vertebrates. now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, anh, and me, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? it's unethical to "sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans. the food industry knows this. that's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych. if you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term. there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology. i suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (you), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me). certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of glu and asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in hvp, necessitates extreme caution. why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults? the main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc. >>between who? over what? i would be most interested in seeing you >>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles >>disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever. > >you mean "asserting". you're being intellectually dishonest (or just >plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily >have anything to do with each other. olney's reports would argue a potential >for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything >whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods, nor does he provide any >studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious >reasons.) it says nothing about msg's contribtion to the phenomenon >of the "chinese restaurant syndrome". it says nothing about the frequent >inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab. olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. terry, epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg. gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. could this be the cause of headaches?

while in grad school, i remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with "heat shock proteins". apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he dna. whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion i don't know, but i never eat burnt food because of this. also, many woods contain toxins. as they are burnt, it would seem logical that some may volatilise, and get into the bbqed food. again, i don't know if these toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross the intestinal mucosa? maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost *anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that may be in the wood used to make charcoal and bbq. anne-marie rousseau e-mail: rousseaua@immunex.com what i say has nothing to do with immunex.

as nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question "why do you need to put msg in almost every food?" i must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than i hoped it was. she believes that msg is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated. to put it a different way, she believes that for some people msg causes them to act toward food like an addict. (eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! } if she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!! can msg be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ? this brings up a side question of mine. i have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. the cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand. i have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. my questions, for the net, are: does the fda regulate the contents of pet food? is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances? is msg put in pet food? ----------------------------------- i speak for myself and not motorola ----------------------------------- -- walter lundby

[...] kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water... from the incredulous side: [macrobert, alan, "reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum.", _whole earth review_, autumn 1986, vnon4 p4(11). an excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.] the crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study, making grand discoveries in his basement. many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people -- kirlian photography, for instance. if you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century. it took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura. in fact, kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists john o. pehek, harry j. kyler, and david l. faust, who reported their findings in the october 15, 1976, issue of science. their conclusion: the variations observed in kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state. nevertheless, television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous parapsychologists) continue to promote kirlian photography as proof of the unknown. -- peter kaminski kaminski@netcom.com

frequently of late, i have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods. what happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel "puffy", like i have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy. the situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notable cases: a cheap chinese fast food chain, a japanese steak house (i had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where i saw the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice. i am under the impression that msg "enhances" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell. if this is correct, i do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of msg can cause other mouth tissues to swell. also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with msg, this is what i suspect as being the cause. i wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of msg in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny. anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of. i will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the tobacco companies still deny). - dm (if i sound grumpy, it's because i had beef with broccoli for lunch today, and now it hurts to swallow) -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ dan myers (madman)		| if the creator had intended us to walk myers@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu	| upright, he wouldn't have given us knuckles ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we will be holding a bake and craft sale at communiversity in princeton on nassau street, saturday april 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the recurrent respiratory papillomatosis foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to encourage research toward a cure for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. our three year old daughter suffers from this disease. below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers. hope you can join us. on saturday, april 24 as part of communiversity in princeton, a local family will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public awareness about a rare disease called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. bill and marlene stern's daughter lindsay is afflicted with this disease characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and trachea. caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths. three year old lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime. even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the recurrent respiratory papillomatosis foundation, a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter, enhance awareness of rrp at the local and national level, and aid in the prevention, cure, and treatment. since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research. because rrp is rare, it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure. part of the rrp foundation's mission is to change that. anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call marlene or bill at 609-890-0502. monetary donations can be made at the foundation's booth during communiversity, april 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown princeton, or sent directly to: 			the recurrent respiratory foundation 	 50 wesleyan drive 	 hamilton sq., nj 08690. thanks mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu
it would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers. this applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. what about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? did they have any guarentee of cures? are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world? as a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on gingko seeds for meniere's? (to the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? it's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. and you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.) gervais

it is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field. it probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). limited tinea pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as well as systemic medication i.e. tablets. finally, a self-diagnosis is not always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal infection and requires very different treatment. gervais

msg is common in many food we eat, including chinese (though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them). i've noticed that when i go out and eat in most of the chinese food restaurants, i will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards. this happens to many of my friends and relatives too. and, heh, we eat chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use msg when we're cooking for ourselves) so, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that msg may cause some allergic reactions in some people. stick with natural things. msg doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter). so, why bother with it? taste food as it should be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of msg. -michael -- michael m. huang | don't believe what your eyes are telling you. icemt, iowa state univ. | all they show is limitation. look with your michael@iastate.edu | understanding, find out what you already know, #include <standard.disclaimer> | and you'll see the way to fly. - j. l. seagull

	the reason i'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to: 1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where i can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet. recently, i had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. he was immediately transferred to a major hospital in boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. this has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc. i don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. he was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. his mri, ekg, cat-scans are all normal, but the eeg's show alot of seizure activity. after many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). this is where we stand right now.... if anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as i mentioned up above, any information relating to this disorder i would sure appreciate hearing from you. i am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather information about it. as i know now, these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so i'm going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight. thanks.

my wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office. when the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok. (it was) on her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures. the doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not! my wife is concerned about this. she saw a tv show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or dateline nbc, etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound. should my wife be concerned? should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find such an expert in chicago?) we don't really have any special medical reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob-gyn can't, then i don't see why we shouldn't use one. any thoughts? -- doug bank private systems division dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com motorola communications sector dougb@nwu.edu schaumburg, illinois dougb@casbah.acns.nwu.edu 708-576-8207

i recently attended an allery seminar. steroid nasal sprays were discussed. afterward on a one-on-one basis, i asked the speaker what if none of the vancanese, beconase, nasalide, nasalcort, or nasalchrom work nor do any oral decongestants work. she replied that she saw an article on vasomotor rhinitis. that this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing other than the afrin's and such would work. (which in my case is true). i want to find out as much as possible about this, since i am going to see my allergist in may and want to be armed to the hilt with information; since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and i have had no relief for 14 months. please respond if you know anything about this and/or please let me know what articles might be helpful that i could look up in the library.
does the bates method work? i first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago, and i have just got hold of a book, "how to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by margaret d. corbett, ('authorized instructor of the bates method), published in 1953. it talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise. has there been any study on whether this method actually works? if it works, is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball? since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically). has there been any recent studies on this? where can i find them? i know rk works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (bates's idea, right?) thanks for any information.

i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. mind machines consist of led gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them. they strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing leds. i understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available. i've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for relaxation. essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc... i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful, the few sources i've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a friend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). so do these mind machines (aka light and sound machines) work? can they induce alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? what research if any has been done on them? could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer? or are they just another bit of quackery? web homer homer@tripos.com

i've recently listened to a tape by dr. stanislaw burzynski, in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti- cancer properties that he names antineoplastons. burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the united states, despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials. what is the generally accepted opinion of dr. burzynski's research? he paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment, but i have no basis from which to judge his claims. two weeks ago, however, i read that the nih's department of alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynski's work. their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldn't investigate a treatment that didn't seem promising. any opinions on burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be appreciated. -- joshua schwimmer jschwimmer@eagle.wesleyan.edu

i live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business. the cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude. one of them especially is very polluted... often i feel faint the first two or three days. i feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level. also, it is very dry in these cities, so i will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol. thing is, i still have symptoms. how can i ensure that my short trips there (no, i don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? is there something else that i could do? a long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about altitude adjustment. has anyone saved the messages? many thanks, vida.

i am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway. about five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. while attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol 3 and soon morphine to relieve the pain. she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term. my questions are: has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the levels of pain? are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced? are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored? any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated. please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group. if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should be posting this to it would also be appreciated. -- gregory w. luft internet: vgwlu@calgary.chevron.com chevron petroleum techonology company tel: (403) 234-6238 500, fifth ave. s.w. fax: (403) 234-5215 calgary, alberta, canada t2p 0l7
to: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (david nye) there is a person on the fido cfs echo who claims that he was cured of cfs by taking accutane. he also claims that you are using it in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome. are you using accutane in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome? have you used it for cfs? have you gotten good results with it? are you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in these conditions? thank you in advance for all replies. ... i think they should rename waco tx to wacko tx!

i am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. i believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. in fact i believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, should be offered free to the american public. this could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure. mike romano -- sir, i admit your gen'ral rule that every poet is a fool; but you yourself may serve to show it, that every fool is not a poet. a. pope

i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning. just after i completed my 4th set of deep squats. today was my weight training day and i was just beginning my routine. all of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep. it was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength. the weight i used for squats wasn't that heavy, i was working hard but not at 100% effort. i waited for a few minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than i normally use. but i dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second. so i quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either. i'll take it easy for the rest of the day. my arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold. horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain. i'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen. so that can't be it. could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (i hope)? has this happened to anyone else? nothing like this has ever happened to me before. does it come with age? thanks, tom -- tom molnar unix systems group, university of toronto computing & communications.

what does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems "off" when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? what are the possible causes of this? why does it happen? pt has stage ii breast cancer, and is taking tamoxifin. also has stage iv lung cancer with known cna metastasis, and is taking klonopin (also had cranial radiation treatments). thanks!

am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor? last saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. i took him to a local "urgent and general care" clinic at 5:50 pm. the clinic was open till 6:00 pm. the receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed here. during the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several trips to the back room, the receptionist told me: 	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back, 	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going 	 to the emergency room; 	- the doctor would not even speak to me; 	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name; 	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "i don't know." i realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but i was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered. my son did get three stitches at the emergency room. i'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so i can write them a letter. we will certainly never set foot in that clinic again. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- mary ryan				mryan@stsci.edu space telescope science institute baltimore, maryland
fyi...i just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to what the group is for...... a note to the users of alt.psychoactives.... this group was originally a takeoff from sci.med. the reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, prozac, lithium,etc), antipsychotics(melleral(sp?), etc), ocd drugs(anafranil, etc), and so on and so forth. it didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere. that's to bad, for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data. it was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of the above mentioned. oh well, i had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and i decided to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for. i think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it being moderated...too bad. oh well, obviously, no one really cares. bill claussen would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group? bill claussen

i heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently published results of a study on multiple-personality-disorder syndrome patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may have a psychological trigger or basis. what i heard about this study was that in one 'personality', a mpds patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what i heard), while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants. if this is true, it is truly fascinating. but, i'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study really showed, and where the study is published. any help out there? jon noring -- charter member --->>> infj club. if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info. ============================================================================= | jon noring | noring@netcom.com | | | jkn international | ip : 192.100.81.100 | fred's gourmet chocolate | | 1312 carlton place | phone : (510) 294-8153 | chips - world's best! | | livermore, ca 94550 | v-mail: (510) 417-4101 | | ============================================================================= who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is.

someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needles..... unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get aids from acupuncture needles. generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." these needles tend to be of a lower quality however, being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles. if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments. the risk here for hepatitis, hiv, etc. transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so i use them. acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. in china, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. this means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical "shot." when the skin is puntured. on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. of course in tcm...the body's exterior is protected by the wei (protective) qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site. while i'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. john badanes, dc, ca romdas@uclink.berkeley.edu

for several years i have been dealing with reccurring corneal erosion. there does not seem to be much known about the cause of such a problem. my current episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea. if it's bad enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy. however, my doctor this time is trying to let it heal by itself by putting a contact lens to protect the area. apparently the problem is not that common, but i'd be curious if anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be found. mark london mrl@nerus.pfc.mit.edu

my girlfriend just started taking imitrex for her migraine headaches. her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics. she stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last thursday (4/15). the weekend was pretty bad, but she made it through with the help of imitrex about every 18 hours. her third injection of imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick. skin was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain. it subsided in an hour or so. since then, she has been taking imitrex as needed to control the pain. immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains. a friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people. apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks. is this just rumor? has anyone else heard of these symptoms? my girlfriend also has mitral valve prolapse. opinions are mine or others but definately not mda's! lauger@ssdgwy.mdc.com mcdonnell douglas aerospace, huntington beach, california, usa

------------- cut here ----------------- hicnet medical newsletter page 13 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 gonorrhea -- colorado, 1985-1992 ================================ source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 the number of reported cases of gonorrhea in colorado increased 19.9% from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. in comparison, in the united states, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend (1). this report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992. in 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the colorado department of health (cdh) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. during 1992, reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively (table 1). similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and hispanics (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (table 1). half the cases of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (stds)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. when compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic (dmhc, the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. concurrently, the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. among self-identified heterosexual men, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at dmhc increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, respectively). four selected laboratories in the metropolitan denver area (i.e., hmo, university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). from 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and hispanics in colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks hicnet medical newsletter page 14 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 increased since 1988 (figure 1). during 1988-1992, the population in colorado increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. in 1992, the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for hispanics (156 per 100,000) (table 1). among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. reported by: ka gershman, md, jm finn, ne spencer, msph, std/aids program; re hoffman, md, state epidemiologist, colorado dept of health. jm douglas, md, denver dept of health and hospitals. surveillance and information systems br, div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention, national center for prevention svcs, cdc. editorial note: the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during 1991-1992. the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. however, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs (2). although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires further assessment. to examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) -- the cdh std/aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, and gang affiliation. the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 19.1a) (7). race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds. risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts. moreover, race- specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado, interventions initiated by the cdh std/aids program include 1) targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio hicnet medical newsletter page 15 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in schools and clinics) to promote awareness of std risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. the educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers. references 1. cdc. table ii. cases of selected notifiable diseases, united states, weeks ending december 26, 1992, and december 28, 1991 (52nd week). mmwr 1993;41:975. 2. cdc. gang-related outbreak of penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae and other sexually transmitted diseases -- colorado springs, colorado, 1989- 1991. mmwr 1993;42:25-8. 3. cdc. relationship of syphilis to drug use and prostitution -- connecticut and philadelphia, pennsylvania. mmwr 1988;37:755-8, 764. 4. rolfs rt, goldberg m, sharrar rg. risk factors for syphilis: cocaine use and prostitution. am j public health 1990;80:853-7. 5. andrus jk, fleming dw, harger dr, et al. partner notification: can it control epidemic syphilis? ann intern med 1990;112:539-43. 6. gershman ka, rolfs rt. diverging gonorrhea and syphilis trends in the 1980s: are they real? am j public health 1991;81:1263-7. 7. public health service. healthy people 2000: national health promotion and disease prevention objectives--full report, with commentary. washington, dc: us department of health and human services, public health service, 1991;

than 11 years of age -- selected states, 1988 and 1989 ====================================================== source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than 1 million years of potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). from 1977 through 1985, all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children. although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u.s. children (1), while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). in addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children (6). to characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) during 1988 and 1989. this report summarizes the findings from this study. data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in brfss -- a population-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc. of these respondents, 5499 (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. each respondent was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child. the two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. software for survey data analysis (sudaan) (7) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals. statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05. each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. of these, six (arizona, kentucky, maine, nebraska, rhode island, and west virginia) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (idaho, maryland, pennsylvania, and washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued); and one state (new york) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone). in nine states, child-passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. the analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law (no-law states). overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel. both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 43.2%, respectively). high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use (figure 1). adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). in comparison, for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). when comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (table 1). in addition, higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use (8). reported by: national center for injury prevention and control; national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cdc. editorial note: the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report. accordingly, occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., head start) that are directed at parents with young children. injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. in addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 they become older. parents, especially those with low educational attainment, those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts. finally, the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes (5). references 1. cdc. childhood injuries in the united states. am j dis child 1990;144:627- 46. 2. partyka sc. papers on

separate cover as part of the mmwr series. each report published in the cdc surveillance summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance findings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions. summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (march 19, 1993) issue of the cdc surveillance summaries (1) are provided below. all subscribers to mmwr receive the cdc surveillance summaries, as well as the mmwr recommendations and reports, as part of their subscriptions. surveillance for and comparison of birth defect prevalences in two geographic areas -- united states, 1983-88 problem/condition: cdc and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. reporting period covered: this report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta, georgia, and selected jurisdictions in california for the years 1983-1988. description of system: the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. the prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in california and 152,970 births in metropolitan atlanta. the prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, sex, and maternal age by using poisson regression. results: regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability. however, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (down syndrome) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose. interpretation: regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. however, the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene pool, or random variation. actions taken: because of the similarities of these data bases, several collaborative studies are being implemented. in particular, the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis. authors: jane schulman, ph.d., nancy hicnet medical newsletter page 21

spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from october through may. reporting period covered: this report covers u.s. influenza surveillance conducted from october 1988 through may 1989. description of system: weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year. results: during the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza a(h1n1) and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season. throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a(h1n1) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated. only 7% of identified viruses were influenza a(h3n2), but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season. during the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a(h3n2) but not influenza a(h1n1). interpretation: the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a(h1n1) and b during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a. actions taken:

of public affairs at the university of arizona health sciences center. copyright 1993, the university of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (ivf- et) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf-et, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (gift), embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. together, these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology (art) procedures. ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management. however, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures. therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility, there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures. this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies. the following article (on back) describes the art procedures available in our center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the realistic expectations for their success. procedures included are: o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer (ivf-et), gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o (gift), cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation. this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies. hicnet medical newsletter page 24 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease. this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome, the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders. the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth of affected children. catherine racowsky, ph.d. associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson, arizona applications, success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility. in vitro fertilization - embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program. this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred to the patient's uterus. all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. before being processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer- hicnet medical newsletter page 25 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 assisted semen analyses. to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf-et, or indeed, gift, follicular development is typically stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh, factrel, lutrepulse) and/or gnrh analogues (lupron, depo lupron, synarel). occasionally, however, ivf-et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles. while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our infertility unit, with the patient sedated. couples who resort to ivf-et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male factor infertility. according to the united states ivf registry, the overall success rate for ivf-et nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle. results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 ivf-et cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies. well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf-et cycle attempts. however, among these, age is the single most significant determinant of conception. therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies. the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. ongoing research in our center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age. we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. currently, the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. gift - this high-tech art procedure is performed in the operating room, usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to ivf-et, involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). under these circumstances, fertilization occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo ivf, with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle. this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page 26 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility. the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf-et technique (range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36 percent and for ivf-et 14 to 18 percent). in view of this fact, one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf-et. however, in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed, benefit the patient. these concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf-et procedure. between january 1, 1991, and december 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 gift cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non-transferred ivf embryos. this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. therefore, as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs, from both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. gamete micromanipulation - this art procedure, which is still very new, is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology). we are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion (szi), which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion. available data from szi programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy. this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception. catherine racowsky, ph.d.

"treating people with azt alone doesn't happen in the real world anymore," said dr. mark jacobson of the university of california--san francisco. also, with recent findings indicating that hiv replicates rapidly in the lymph nodes after infection, physicians may begin pushing even harder for early treatment of hiv-infected patients. ================================================================== "new infectious disease push" american medical news (04/05/93) vol. 36, no. 13, p. 2 the center for disease control will launch a worldwide network to track the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in time to help prevent their spread. the network is expected to cost between $75 million and $125 million but is an essential part of the clinton administration's health reform plan, according to the cdc and outside experts. the plan will require the cdc to enhance surveillance of disease in the united states and establish about 15 facilities across the world to track disease. ===================================================================== april 13, 1993 ===================================================================== "nih plans to begin aids drug trials at earlier stage" nature (04/01/93) vol. 362, no. 6419, p. 382 (macilwain, colin) hicnet medical newsletter page 42 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 the national institutes of health has announced it will start treating hiv-positive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion, resulting from recent findings that show hiv is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed. anthony fauci, director of the u.s. national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), said, "we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance." he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds. fauci, who co- authored one of the two papers published last week in nature, rejects the argument by one of his co-authors, cecil fox, that the new discovery indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time and money" because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly. john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of hiv-infected patients. aids activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue. "we've known about this for five years, but we're glad it is now in the public domain," said jesse dobson of the california-based project inform. but peter duesberg, who believes that aids is independent of hiv and is a result of drug abuse in the west, said, "we are several paradoxes away from an explanation of aids--even if these papers are right." ====================================================================== april 14, 1993 ====================================================================== "risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal" washington post (04/14/93), p. a9 the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected health-care professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research published in today's journal of the american medical association (jama). this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote. three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hiv-positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus. the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire, maryland, and florida. each study started with an hiv-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate. the new hampshire study found that none of the 1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hiv-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv. in maryland, 413 of 1,131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at johns hopkins hospital were found to be hiv-negative. similarly in florida, 900 of 1,192 dental hicnet medical newsletter page 43 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 patients, who all had been treated by an hiv-positive general dentist, were tested and found to be negative for hiv. the florida researchers, led by gordon m. dickinson of the university of miami school of medicine, said, "this study indicates that the risk for transmission of hiv from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed." related story: philadelphia inquirer (04/14) p. a6 ====================================================================== "alternative medicine advocates divided over new nih research program" aids treatment news (04/02/93) no. 172, p. 6 (gilden, dave) the new office of alternative medicine at the national institutes of health has raised questions about the nih's commitment to an effort that uses unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods. the oam is a small division of the nih, with its budget only at $2 million dollars compared to more than $10 billion for the nih as a whole. in addition, the money for available research grants is even smaller. about $500,000 to $600,000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants. kaiya montaocean, of the center for natural and traditional medicine in washington, d.c., says the oam is afraid to become involved in aids. "they have to look successful and there is no easy answer in aids," she said. there is also a common perception that the oam will focus on fields the nih establishment will find non-threatening, such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture. when the oam called for an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year, the aids community was largely missing from the meeting. in addition, activists' general lack of contact with the office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored. jon greenberg, of act-up/new york, said, "the oam advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience. it will take them several years to accept the nature of research." nevertheless, dr. leanna standish, research director and aids investigator at the bastyr college of naturopathic medicine in seattle, said, "here is a wonderful opportunity to fund aids research. it's only fair to give the office time to gel, but it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much more [than public relations]." ====================================================================== "herpesvirus decimates immune-cell soldiers" science news (04/03/93) vol. 143, no. 14, p. 215 (fackelmann, kathy a.) scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells. this attack causes the killer cells to malfunction, diminishing an important component in the immune system's fight against diseases. also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a factor in immune diseases, such as aids. in 1989, paolo lusso's research found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the cd4 t-lymphocyte, which is the primary target of hiv. lusso also found that herpesvirus-6 can hicnet medical newsletter page 44 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 kill natural killer cells. scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of patients infected with hiv do not work correctly. lusso's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack, according to anthony l. komaroff, a researcher with harvard medical school. despite the test-tube findings, scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body. lusso's team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the cd4 receptor molecule that provides access for hiv. cd4 t-lymphocytes express this surface receptor, making them vulnerable to hiv's attack. researchers concluded that herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of hiv. ====================================================================== april 15, 1993 ==================================================================== "aids and priorities in the global village: to the editor" journal of the american medical association (04/07/93) vol. 269, no. 13, p. 1636 (gellert, george and nordenberg, dale f.) all health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems, but also to be committed to related policies, write george gellert and dale f. nordenberg of the orange county health care agency, santa ana, calif., and the emory university school of public health in atlanta, ga., respectively. dr. berkley's editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids. it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence, it is not the only illness doing so. diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations. berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries, and the increased need for international assistance that will result. berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade. but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general, and hiv/aids in particular. vice president al gore proposes in his book "earth in the balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development, with programs to promote literacy, improve child survival, and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world. if enacted, this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health. ==================================================================== "aids and priorities in the global village: in reply" journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page 45 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 medical association (04/07/93) vol. 269, no. 13, p. 1636 (berkley, seth) every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses, writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york, n.y., in reply to a letter by drs. gellert and nordenberg. although it is true that diseases other than aids, such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting, berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention. hiv differs from other diseases, in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread. for most endemic diseases, the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death. but with aids and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in disease burden but financially, is much greater. interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission. berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership. but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic, but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule. hicnet medical newsletter page 46 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: aids/hiv articles :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: first hiv vaccine trial begins in hiv-infected children h h s n e w s ******************************************************************** u.s. department of health and human services march 29, 1993 first hiv vaccine therapy trial begins in hiv-infected children the national institutes of health has opened the first trial of experimental hiv vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), the virus that causes aids. the trial will compare the safety of three hiv experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. volunteers must be hiv- infected but have no symptoms of hiv disease. hhs secretary donna e. shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids." anthony s. fauci, m.d., director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research, said the trial "is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick." if these vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials. the centers for disease control and prevention estimates 10,000 children in the united states have hiv. by the end of the decade, the world health organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. the study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old. niaid, which funds the aids clinical trials group network, anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development. preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv-specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page 47 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 stimulate new ones. it will be several years, however, before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. the results from the pediatric trial, known as actg 218, will be examined closely for other reasons as well. "this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines," said daniel hoth, m.d., director of niaid's division of aids. "we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children." in the united states, most hiv-infected children live in poor inner-city areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or hispanic. nearly all hiv-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth. an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby. as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children. hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults. the most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age. these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. at least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants. all volunteers must have well-documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen. they cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. study chair john s. lambert, m.d., of the university of rochester medical school, and co- chair samuel katz, m.d., of duke university school of medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara, m.d., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid's division of aids. "we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers, for example, than another," said dr. mcnamara. "we'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects." he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page 48 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 products. the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins. these so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv-infected adults. one vaccine made by microgenesys inc. of meriden, conn., contains gp160--a protein that gives rise to hiv's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant. adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine. presently, alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the food and drug administration. both of the other vaccines--one made by genentech inc. of south san francisco and the other by biocine, a joint venture of chiron and ciba-geigy, in emeryville, calif.--contain the major hiv surface protein, gp120, plus adjuvant. the genentech vaccine contains alum, while the biocine vaccine contains mf59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other phase i vaccine trials in adults. a low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children. twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, considered the placebo. neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive. if the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin. each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization. for more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call the aids clinical trials information service, 1-800-trials-a, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., est weekdays. the service has spanish-speaking information

disease independently news from the national institute of dental research there is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at the national institues of health. they report that hiv itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv. although the hiv genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' immunity, the researchers found. this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease. our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system, said lead author dr. jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research (nidr). dr. kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses. developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult, since most animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus. to bypass this problem, scientists have developed hiv-transgenic mice, which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material. nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice. the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals. institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l988. those mice, however, became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth. in the present study, the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv, which allowed the animals to live longer. some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their necks and backs. other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans. no skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals. tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material. hicnet medical newsletter page 50 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned on," or active, said dr. kopp. the scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the mice: no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections. the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions, dr. kopp said. further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light. the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin. papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said. no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light. the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr. peter dickie, who is now with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. collaborating on the study with dr. kopp were mr. charles wohlenberg, drs. nickolas dorfman, joseph bryant, abner notkins, and paul klotman, all of nidr; dr. stephen katz of the national cancer institute; and dr. james rooney, formerly with nidr and now with burroughs wellcome. hicnet medical newsletter page 51 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 clinical consultation telephone service for aids h h s n e w s ******************************************** u.s. department of health and human services march 4, 1993 hhs secretary donna e. shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids. the toll-free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. it provides information on drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods. the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital. secretary shalala said, "one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care. a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids, which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks. currently, many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience." secretary shalala said, "this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available." the telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. est (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. pst) monday through friday. during these times, consultants will try to answer questions immediately, or within an hour. at other times, physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be answered as quickly as possible. health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care, including the latest hiv/aids drug treatment information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, literature searches and other information. the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials. when a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse practitioner. all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hiv-related diseases. the consultant asks for patient-specific information, including cd4 cell count, current medications, sex, age and the patient's hiv history. this national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page 52 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern california. the initial project was funded by hrsa's bureau of health professions, through its community provider aids training (cpat) project, and by the american academy of family physicians. "when providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients," said hrsa administrator robert g. harmon. m.d., m.p.h. "this project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the hiv/aids patients they serve." "this service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on hiv care management," said hrsa's associate administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources development, g. stephen bowen, m.d., m.p.h. "providers who treat people with hiv or aids have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment methods and therapies for people with hiv or aids." hrsa is one of eight u.s. public health service agencies within hhs. aids hotline numbers for consumers cdc national aids hotline -- 1-800-342-aids for information in spanish - 1-800-344-sida aids clinical trials (english & spanish) -- 1-800-trials-a hicnet medical newsletter page 53  ------------- cut here ----------------- -- this is the last part --------------- --- internet: david@stat.com fax: +1 (602) 451-1165 bitnet: atw1h@asuacad fidonet=> 1:114/15 amateur packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na

editor :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: i would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the mednews ocr/scanner fund. we have reached our goal! a hewlett packard scanjet iip was purchased this week. thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received: john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again, thank you to all who gave! i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product. wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems. it runs under windows 3.1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners. when initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned, and in what order. once an image is scanned, you can bring up the pop-up image verification. the software gives you two "errors" at this point. blue which are words that were converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary. yellow shade, which are words that wordscan plus doesn't think it converted correctly at all. i have found that the software should give itself more credit. it is usually correct, instead of wrong. if a word is shaded blue, you can add it to your personal dictionary. the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words. i find this to be very limited, considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. after a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats. also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format. i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files. i use hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 an intel satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a pcx/dcx format. while most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent. overall, a very impressive product. the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary. 200 specialized words is just too small. if anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email. hicnet medical newsletter page 2 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: centers for disease control and prevention - mmwr :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: emerging infectious diseases ============================ source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states. since the early 1970s, the u.s. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., escherichia coli o157:h7, hepatitis c virus, human immunodeficiency virus, legionnaires disease, lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis (tb), have increased in many areas. furthermore, control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, salmonellosis, shigellosis, tb, and staphylococcal infections (2). emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and minority and underserved populations. the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u.s. health-care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs (3). this issue of mmwr introduces a new series, "emerging infectious diseases." future articles will address these diseases, as well as surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and public health officials. this first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of e. coli o157:h7 in the western united states (4). references 1. burnet m. natural history of infectious disease. cambridge, england: cambridge university press, 1963. 2. kunin cm.

infections from hamburgers -- western united states, 1992-1993 ======================================================= source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 from november 15, 1992, through february 28, 1993, more than 500 laboratory-confirmed infections with e. coli o157:h7 and four associated deaths occurred in four states -- washington, idaho, california, and nevada. this report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain. washington on january 13, 1993, a physician reported to the washington department of health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. during january 16-17, a case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal hus identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls implicated eating at chain a restaurants during the week before symptom onset (matched odds ratio or=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). on january 18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain a restaurants was initiated. as a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during january- february 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or hus were reported to the state health department. a total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case definition of culture-confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection or postdiarrheal hus (figure 1). of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection during the week preceding onset of symptoms. of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain a restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. of the 338 patients who recalled what they ate in a chain a restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating a regular-sized hamburger patty. onsets of illness peaked from january 17 through january 20. of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 developed hus, and three died. the median age of patients was 7.5 years (range: 0-74 years). idaho following the outbreak report from washington, the division of health, idaho department of health and welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection, with illness onset dates from december 11, 1992, through february 16, 1993 (figure 2a). four persons were hospitalized; one developed hus. during the week preceding illness onset, 13 (93%) had eaten at a chain a restaurant. california in late december, the san diego county department of health services was notified of a child with e. coli o157:h7 infection who subsequently died. active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with e. coli o157:h7 infections or hus from mid-november through mid-january 1993. four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain a restaurant and hicnet medical newsletter page 5 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 four at a chain b restaurant in san diego. after the washington outbreak was reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during december 1992 and january 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. a case was defined as postdiarrheal hus, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded e. coli o157:h7, with onset from november 15, 1992, through january 31, 1993. illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (figure 2b). the outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. fourteen persons were hospitalized, seven developed hus, and one child died. the median age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). a case-control study of the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant in san diego (matched or=13; 95% confidence interval ci=1.7-99). a study comparing case-patients who ate at chain a restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched or=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). chain b was not statistically associated with illness. nevada on january 22, after receiving a report of a child with hus who had eaten at a local chain a restaurant, the clark county (las vegas) health district issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the health department. a case was defined as postdiarrheal hus, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the washington strain of e. coli o157:h7, with onset from december 1, 1992, through february 7, 1993. because local laboratories were not using sorbitol macconkey (smac) medium to screen stools for e. coli o157:h7, this organism was not identified in any patient. after smac medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of one patient 38 days after illness onset. of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (figure 2c), nine were hospitalized; three developed hus. the median age was 30.5 years (range: 0-83 years). analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant during the week preceding illness onset (matched or=undefined; lower confidence limit=4.9). a case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients also implicated eating hamburgers at chain a (matched or=6.0; 95% ci=0.7- 49.8). other investigation findings during the outbreak, chain a restaurants in washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on november 19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on november 20, 1992. the outbreak strain of e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. approximately 272,672 (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. a meat traceback by a cdc team identified five slaughter plants in the united states and one in canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the hicnet medical newsletter page 6 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing the likelihood of contamination. the animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. no one slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in families and child day care settings is ongoing.

illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus, the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been implicated (3). preliminary data from a cdc 2-year, nationwide, multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e. coli o157:h7 that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a higher rate than for any other pathogen. infection with e. coli o157:h7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page 7 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 smac medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection (4). the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications. illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients develop hus, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e. coli o157:h7 in the absence of routine surveillance. despite the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington (1). clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e. coli o157:h7 using smac agar (5). when infections with e. coli o157:h7 are identified, they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public health action to prevent further cases. e. coli o157:h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can contaminate meat during slaughter. cdc is collaborating with the u.s. department of agriculture's food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e. coli o157:h7 entering the meat supply. because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated. the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices are clear. in this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role. the food and drug administration (fda) has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 f (86.1 c) (fda, personal communication, 1993). regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks. the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e. coli o157:h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e. coli o157:h7. references 1. cdc. preliminary report: foodborne outbreak of escherichia coli o157:h7 infections from hamburgers --western united states, 1993. mmwr 1993;42:85-6. 2.

======================================================= source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the united states almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). long-term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). to monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, cdc's 1991 national health interview survey-health promotion and disease prevention supplement (nhis-hpdp) collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the u.s. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. this report summarizes findings from this survey. the 1991 nhis-hpdp supplement asked "have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life?" and "do you use snuff now?" similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview. ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users. current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now. ever smokers included current and former smokers. data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates. confidence intervals (cis) were calculated by using standard errors generated by the software for survey data analysis (sudaan) (3). in 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) u.s. adults were current users of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) women. for all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men. for men, the prevalence of use was highest among those aged 18-24 years (table 1); for women, the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among american indians/alaskan natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among american indians/alaskan natives and blacks. among both men and women, prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern united states and in rural areas. although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among hicnet medical newsletter page 10 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only for women (p less than 0.05) (table 1). among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (table 2). although women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. an estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% ci=4.1-4.6) adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users. among ever users, the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% ci=57.7-62.1). among persons aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users (56.2% 95% ci=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% ci=64.2-76.6). among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% ci=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 95% ci=68.9-78.1). among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% ci=19.9-26.0) currently smoked, 33.3% (95% ci=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% ci=39.9-47.7) never smoked. in comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% ci=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 95% ci=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% ci=40.6- 49.6). reported by: office on smoking and health, national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion; div of health interview statistics, national center for health statistics, cdc. editorial note: the findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males. adolescent and young adult males, in particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation. for example, targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). in this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. in the 1991 nhis-hpdp, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. in a previous study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked hicnet medical newsletter page 11 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 occasionally (7). in addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking (8). health-care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. the national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 2000 objective 3.9) and american indian/alaskan native youth (to no more than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

"people with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation," said joel schwartz, ph.d., of the environmental protection agency, who was the lead author of the study. "when people are on the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over the edge." the seattle study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less. these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung. cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of pm10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air. in seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms. the authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four-day average of pm10, the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent. the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease, an official journal of the american thoracic society, the lung association's medical section. the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat. a 1992 study by dr. schwartz and douglas dockery, ph.d., of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the united states. other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children. "government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone," says dr. schwartz. "but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well." one problem in setting, standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study. unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and hicnet medical newsletter page 29 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 acid aerosols. "researchers can't put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution," says dr. schwartz. "we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles. " consequently, most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research like the seattle study. given that the epa's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any time soon. until changes are made, there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles. "in some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's rarely particulate matter," says dr. schwartz. "however, pm10 doesn't have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy." hicnet medical newsletter page 30 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development conference on diagnosis and treatment of early melanoma brought together experts in dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality. following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma. a copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by calling the nih office of medical applications of research

6, number 10 april 20, 1993 nci-designated cancer centers the cancer centers program is comprised of 55 nci-designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. within the program, there are four types of cancer centers: basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer prevention and control research. although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was the national cancer act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones. the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and cancer control research. over the next two decades, the centers' program grew progressively. in 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. today, there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status. to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center, an institution must pass rigorous peer review. under guidelines newly established in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice. moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant (also referred to as a p30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations. these criteria encompass strong participation in nci-designated high-priority clinical trials, significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of sources. the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions. hicnet medical newsletter page 32 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 of the 55 nci-designated cancer centers, 14 are of the basic science type. these centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory. clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs. there are 12 such centers today. finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research. these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs. consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. together, the 55 nci-designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. comprehensive cancer centers (internet addresses are given where available) university of alabama at birmingham comprehensive cancer center basic health sciences building, room 108 1918

================================================================== "nih set to test multiple aids vaccines" reuters (04/08/93) (frank, jacqueline) washington--the clinton administration will permit the national institutes of health to test multiple aids vaccines instead of only allowing the army to test a single vaccine, administration sources said thursday. the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc. and the national institutes of health, which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested. health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday. companies including genentech inc., chiron corp., and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests. the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected. shalala refuted last week's reports that the clinton administration had decided the army's test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time. "the report was inaccurate, and i expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours about that particular aids research project," said shalala. administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr. bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously. but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years. ================================================================== hicnet medical newsletter page 41 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 "the limits of azt's impact on hiv" u.s. news & world report (04/12/93) vol. 114, no. 14, p. 18 azt has become the most widely used drug to fight aids since it was approved by the food and drug administration in 1987. burroughs wellcome, the manufacturer of azt, made $338 million last year alone from sales of the drug. however, a team of european researchers recently reported that although hiv-positive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing aids within the first year of treatment, that benefit disappeared two years later. the lancet published preliminary findings of the three-year study, which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug's cost, side effects, and general efficacy. even though u.s. researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than american trials, many argue the european researchers' suggestion that hiv-positive patients experience little improvement in their illness before the development of aids symptoms. in addition, researchers have long been familiar with the --------- end of part 3 ------------ --- internet: david@stat.com fax: +1 (602) 451-1165 bitnet: atw1h@asuacad fidonet=> 1:114/15 amateur packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na

hello, i am writing a grant proposal for a developmental genetics class and i have chose to look at the neurofibromatosis 1 gene and its variable expressivity. i am curious what has already been done on this subject, especially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting phenotype. my literature search has produce many references, but i want to make sure i am proposing new research. if anyone knows aything that has been recently or key peopl doing research to search for using medline, i would apprciate being informed. thank you. lisa megna lmegna@titan.ucc.umass.edu

i don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart failure. one of my friends has had to go to the doctor because he had chest pains. the doc said it was arythmia. so he had to go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. his doctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused cancer ( that he was taking). well, i suggested that he run, excersize and eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing to do with it. does anyone know what causes arythmia and how it can be treated? 			thanks

living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses. these electric fields change with location and time in a large organism. special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. perhaps not. studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred years old, but not a popular activity. perhaps, except in the case of a few tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed. there are some hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding the healing of broken bones, but not understood why. bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. ideas such as frankenstein reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as when volta invented the battery. i personally don't care to revert to supernatural cause to explain things we don't yet understand.

hello, i am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) method against hay fever. what is the state of affairs about this. i went to a doctor and paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the diagnostic that i am allergic to (june and timothy) grass. i believe this. from now on it looks like 2 shots per week for 6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. each shot costs $20. talking about soaring costs and the health care system, i would call that a racket. we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office. apart from this issue, i was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever. is that right? thanks for information. ej

"introduction to molecular biology for computer scientists" prof. mick noordewier (rutgers university) this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain. material covered will include structural and informational molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as relates to current computational approaches. dr. noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm "introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists" dr. richard lathrop (mit & arris corp.) an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications. fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning. the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence. dr. lathrop, co-developer of ariadne and related technologies, has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry. 3:00-5:45pm "neural networks, statistics, and information theory in biological sequence analysis" dr. alan lapedes (los alamos national laboratory) this tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis. closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data. dr. lapedes, of the theoretical division at los alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain. 3:00-5:45pm "genetic algorithms and genetic programming" prof. john koza (stanford university) the genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally inspired by a biological metaphor. this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm. genetic programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed. particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods. dr. koza, a consulting professor of computer science at stanford, has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field. 3:00-5:45pm "linguistic methods in sequence analysis" prof. david searls (university of pennsylvania) & shmuel pietrokovski (weizmann institute) approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence. these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness. dr. searls, who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn, represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order syntactic approaches to sequence data, while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof. edward trifinov in the area of word-based analyses. registration form mail, with check made out to

a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohn's disease. but she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables, without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence. her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the problems of people with crohn's disease ?

having been gone for 10 days, i'm way behind on my news reading, so many pardons if i am repeating something that has been said already. i read a good book while i was away, the antibiotic paradox: how miracle drugs are destroying the miracle, stuart b. levy, m.d., 1992, plenum press, isbn:0-306-44331-7. it is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics. it is interesting & written at a level which i think many sci.med readers would appreciate -- which is: it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to this particular information. i.e., it assumes you are smart enough to understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in microbiology or medicine. table of contents: chapter 1 	from tragedy the antibiotic age is born chapter 2 	the disease and the cure: the microscopic world of bacteria and 	antibiotics chapter 3 	reliance on medicine and self-medication: the seeds of antibiotic 	misuse chapter 4 	antibiotic resistance: microbial adaptation and evolution chapter 5 	the antibiotic myth chapter 6 	antibiotics, animals and the resistance gene pool chapter 7 	further ecological considerations: antibiotic use in agriculture, 	aquaculture, pets, and minor animal species chapter 8 	future prospects: new advances against potential disaster chapter 9 	the individual and antibiotic resistance chapter 10 	antibiotic resistance: a societal issue at local, national, and 	international levels. includes bibliography and index. i personally found that it made very good airplane-reading. -rg ------------------------ ruth ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu> philosophy department;wesleyan university;usa

[...edited for brevity...] 	"chances are good that if you watched '60 minutes' last november 	3rd [1991], you came away feeling msg is bad for you. [...] in 	the segment entitled 'no msg,' for instance, show host ed bradley 	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently 	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven 	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on msg that make the 	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 	those studies are. 	consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to 	a study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in order 	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that msg, 	a flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well as 	in many supermarket items, causes headaches. what he does not 	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on 	humans but on rabbits. 	one of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist 	patricia williams, ph.d., says it certainly is conceivable that 	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get 	headaches from it. 'but,' she explains, 'the show probably 	overemphasized the extent of the problem.' 	a second lapse comes with mention of dr. john olney, a professor 	at the washington university school of medicine who, mr. bradley 	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory 	animals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters' because 	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage. dr. olney's 	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human 	youngsters. 	in fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did dr. olney's 	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected 	extremely high doses of msg into rodents, completely bypassing 	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly, 	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance 	to very young animals on an empty stomach. of course, neither 	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in msg 	with food. and most of what they take in is broken down by 	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little 	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human 	blood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrations 	found in dr. olney's lab animals..... 	the world health organization appears to be very much aware of 	that fact. and so does the european communities' scientific 	committee for food....both, after examining numerous studies, 	have concluded that msg is safe. 	their determination makes sense, considering that msg has never 	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed 	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a 	burning sensation, among others. in fact, the most fail-safe 	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently 	exonerated the much-maligned substance. 	that's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of 	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever 	we eat any food that contains protein. the reason is that one 	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken 	down into glutamate during digestion. 	it's a breakdown that occurs frequently. glutamic acid is the 	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet. it makes 	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in 	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat. 	that doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number 	of people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefore 	sensitive to it...the consensus reached by large, international 	professional organizations [is that msg is safe], the same consensus 	reached by the fda and the biomedical community at large." -rich young (these are not kodak's opinions.)

i can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci. med. nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist. calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics. these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like elaine in sci. med. nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack. could it just be professional jealousy? i couldn't help elaine or jon but somebody else did. could they know more than me? no way, they must be a quack. i've been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are? those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet). typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students. those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class. that's okay because i know that some of what i'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the u.s. it's really too bad that most u.s. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. in animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped. medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic. humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin. these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised. they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body. but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body. a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. steve got real upset with elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems. if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling elaine's doctor a quack. here is a brief primer on yeast. yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts. the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus. an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an e. coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used. in diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose. candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection. without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives. if it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, gi tract or vagina. in diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers. the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site. whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain. when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it. if it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the gi tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food. the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane "barrier". if they do, an inflammatory response will be set up. most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets. about 30% of all american's die with less vitamin a than they were born with(u.s. autopsy studies). while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system. this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. while diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned. while drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection. the toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution. but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what mr. steve dyer says. but even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier). lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth. from it's name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows. candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment. in the vagina, l. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). in the gi system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract. one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. if the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids. if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool). this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place. after extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt. on to another doctor, and so on. richard kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?). if my gut hurt me on a constant basis, i would want it fixed. yes it's nice to know that i don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress? when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, steve dyer calls him a quack. candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment. the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems. many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this). my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams. this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections). this m.d. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l. acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile. after three treatments, sex returned to our marraige. i have often wondered what an m.d. with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. the nonpathogenic bacteria l. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. if taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut. through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. but before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened. this is accomplished by vitamin a, vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamins. diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate. these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). some of the above material was obtained from "natural healing" by mark bricklin, published by rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course. i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms. another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the gi system is involved. if candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. if steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine. i jumped all over steve in sci. med. nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin a and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut. people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way. those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content. if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, i wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. martin banschbach, ph.d. professor

i was wondering if anyone had any information about molluscous contagiosem. i acquired it, and fortunately got rid of it, but the question still lingers in my mind: where did it come from? the little bit of info that i have received about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually, but also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia. any information will be greatly appreciated.

(rather ironic in this day and age). the whole point is preventative ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible. i was told that among the numerous things that were heavily discouraged (i only listed a few), to try the ones i wanted and see how i felt. if it's bad, don't do it again! remember though that this was while i was in remission. for veggies: cook the daylights out of them. i prefer steaming ... i think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage may vary. as with anything else, check with your doctor. don't just take my word. but this is the info i've been given, and it may be a starting point for discussion. good luck! -spenser -- s. spenser aden --- lockheed engineering and sciences co. --- (713) 483-2028 nasa --- flight data and evaluation office --- johnson space center, houston spenser@fudd.jsc.nasa.gov (internet) --- opinions herein are mine alone. aden@vf.jsc.nasa.gov (if above bounces) --- "eschew obfuscation." - unknown

i had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high school. before that, i used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks, and eyes so itchy i couldn't get to sleep. after about 6 months on the shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back. i stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college. my allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be. so yes, the shots do work.

the best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot. for streptomycin, usually given intra muscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. make sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it pierces the skin). ps: try to go to a doctor. self-treatment and self-injection should be avoided as far as possible.
great post martin. very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.

i couldn't help elaine or jon but somebody else did. you've helped me already by your post. of course, i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being the phlegmatic i am, maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts. let's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent. >...humans have all >kinds of different organisms living in the gi system (mouth, stomach, small >and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin. these are >nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune >system is compromised. they are also called nonpathogens because unlike >the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce >toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body. but any of >these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up >residence within the body. a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this >happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. in my well-described situation (in prior posts), i definitely was immune stressed. blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low. my sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. i also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years! in the end, even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the details), and other symptoms. three very traditional ent's made this diagnosis (i did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection). enough of this background (provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti-fungal therapy below). the first question i have is this. can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered 'systemic' in the classic sense? it is sort of an inbetween infection. >steve got real upset with elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals >and vitamin a for her gi problems. if steve really understoood what >vitamin a does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling >elaine's doctor a quack. i was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin a. my doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 iu of vitamin a for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 iu for the next couple of weeks. i also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular specialists). i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin a (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that i maintain a 50,000 iu/day of beta carotene. call me carrot face. :^) hopefully, elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements. i'm even reevaluating some supplements i'm taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which steve dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition. if niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage. >survives. if it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, gi tract or vagina. in though i do now believe, based on my successful therapy with sporanox, that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, i still want to ask the question: have there been any studies that demonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)? (my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal). btw, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms. i'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion. >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus >membrane or skin bloom site. whether this is an allergic like reaction to >the candida or not isn't certain. my doctor tested me (i believe a rast or rast similar test) for allergic response to specificially candida albicans, and i showed a strong positive. another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless? and, assuming it is true that candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body's allergic response? as i said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a m.d. degree or a ph.d. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis. btw, and i'll repost this again. dr. ivker, in his book, "sinus survival", has routinely given, before anything else, nizoral (a pre-sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years. he claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication. he's also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help. this implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream. again, i admit, lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core nt who has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will. >if it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty >nondescript. this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the appropriate studies are done. and that is if you can't observe or culture the yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease. and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body. it's a real catch-22. another catch-22: those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered). i agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right. however, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding. that is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a national lab, i'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects). i'm afraid that even if dr. ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results. it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist. period. kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint. kind of reminds me of lister... >candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in >the sinuses, the gi tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the >vaginal tract which compete with it for food. the human immune system >ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless >they broach the mucus membrane "barrier". if they do, an inflammatory >response will be set up. most americans are not getting enough vitamin a >from their diets. about 30% of all american's die with less vitamin a than >they were born with(u.s. autopsy studies). while this low level of vitamin >a does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane >barrier system. this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong >inflammatory response after a candida bloom. aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia?

when i finally find a >doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, steve dyer calls him a quack. as i've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work. for example, i went to three ent's, who all said that i will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition). after three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin c, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. of course, skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent's i saw who said that i'd just have to "live with it". i'm confident i will reach what one could call a total "cure". the anti-fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years. (note: for those having sinus problems, may i suggest the book by dr. ivker i mention above. be sure to get the revised edition.) >...i have often wondered what an m.d. with chronic >gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his >patients is a non-existent syndrome. dr. ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ent's totally floored him when they said "you'll just have to live with it". he spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis. he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it. his one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice. i'm sure if i commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- "yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, "it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly. i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient. maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical yeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted. remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic. if a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice? maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn't work. i'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help. you have to do both; both have to be balanced, which we don't see from some of the posters to this group. there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues. i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so i did the natural thing: i went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result i have found significant relief. would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective? i'd like to hear a doctor tell me: "well, i've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly don't work for you, i now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others. i can't promise anything, and there are some risks. you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and i'll have to register your case at the state board." anyway, if my ent had suggested this to me, i would've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient. such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free. it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient. it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery). i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in size. >if taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut. through >aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. >but before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system >needs to be strengthened. this is accomplished by vitamin a, vitamin c and >some of the b-complex vitamins. diet surveys repeatedly show that americans >are not getting enough b6 and folate. these are probably the segement of >the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent >disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). what dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes?

hi, i've just returned from a visit with my ob/gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y'all can help me with. i've been seeing her every 4 weeks for the past few months (i'm at week 28) and during the last 2 visits i've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 4 weeks. she said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. as it stands i've thus far gained 26 pounds. also she says that though i'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, i think she mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus. when i was 13 weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks. i must also add, that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and i have a very difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to. (i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out.) anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick (throwing up) about 2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated. (i told her about this). i know this because i wasn't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'. well now i only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile related. but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when i was lying on my right side. it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side, and then it hurt no matter what position i was in. next, i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse. however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it wasn't as much of a problem. so the doctor says i have cholistatis, and that i should avoid fatty foods. this makes sense, and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own. but i'm still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods. but doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet. this means no meat except fish and chicken w/o skin (i do this anyway). no nuts, fried food, cheese etc. i am allowed skim milk. she said i should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas). also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( potatoes, pasta, rice)! she said i can't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed. i'm concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process. and if i'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores? and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she's concerned about fat? i'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis, which i can't seem to find any information on. she originally said that i should only gain 20 pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about 20 lbs overweight when i started. but my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems. she also asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them are. anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain, and feel like i'm being 'punished' by a severe diet. she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week. what i want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet? i would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since i'm trying that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet. i think she assumes i must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i'm not able to use the energy from the food i do eat. any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated. i'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i'll end up having to eat constantly. thus far i don't find any foods satisfying. thanks g

i got asked in sci. med. nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?). i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones. not long after i got into sci. med. i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation. i'm going to state it again here. but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b6 supplements. read on to find out why(i have my asbestos suit on now guys). vitamin c will form oxalic acid. but large doses are needed (above 6 grams per day). 	1. review article "nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 	 stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c" int. clin. nutr. rev. 	 5(3):110-129(1985). but glycine also forms oxalic acid(d-amino acid oxidases). for both glycine and vitamin c, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine, but to increase your intake of vitamin b6. 	2. "control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 	 patients with kidney stones" int. urol. nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 	 200 to 500 mg of b6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 	 excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program. 	3. the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" clin. sci. 38 	 :277-86(1970). patients receiving at least 150mg b6 each day 	 showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels. for gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(b6 is required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination(d-amino acid oxidases). for vitamin c, the effect is quite different. there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism. the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid. but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day, not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid. at very high doses of vitamin c(above 10 grams per day), more of the extra vitamin c (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid. in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production(proc. soc. exp. biol. med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day. until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation. b6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body. there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b6 that we don't know about yet. vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b6. differences in b6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism). increasing your intake of b6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements. since the typical american diet is deficient in b6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is b6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut). diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(urol int.35:309 -15,1980). if 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion. 	here are the high oxalate foods: 	1. beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea. 	 contain at least 25mg/100grams 	2. beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, 	 peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe. 	 contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams. if the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection. a recent n.eng.j. med. article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all. if you also increase your intake of b6, you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at all. the rda for b6 is 2mg per day for males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). b6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months). the usda food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the u.s. coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the b6 requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block b6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of b6, or promote b6 excretion in the urine. common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids. i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b6 requirement. the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b6 requirement(this would be on top of your dietary intake of b6). any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b6 supplements. one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca/mg dietary ratio is 2/1. magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium-oxalate. 	4. "the magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi"invest. urol 10:147(1972) 	5. "effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium interaction"j. urol. 143(2):248-51(1990). 	6.review article, "magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones" j. presse med. 161(1):25-27(1987). there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b6. i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a. in mass. jumped all over me. i guess that he doesn't read the medical literature. oh well, since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, i thought i'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office. martin banschbach, ph.d. professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine 1111 w. 17th street tulsa, ok. 74107 "without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance". from a wise man who lived in china, many, many years ago. i think that it still has meaning in today's world.

okay, this is a long shot. my friend robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very regularly. this has been going on for a number of years. she's seen a number of doctors; six was the last count, i think. most of them have said either "you have mono" or "you're full of it; there's nothing wrong with you." one has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her, and one has claimed that it is epstein-barr syndrome. now, what she told me about ebs is that very few doctors even believe that it exists. (obviously, this has been her experience.) so, what's the story? is it real? does the medical profession believe it to be real? has anyone had success is treating ebs? or is it just something to live with? thanks for your assistance. joel "the ogre" cherney jcherney@reed.edu of the horde

one thing that i haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (fas). i was diagnosed last may w/crohn's of the terminal ileum. when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of epa (an essentially fa) in reducing inflammation. the evidence was mixed. [many of these studies are discussed in "inflammatory bowel disease," macdermott, stenson. 1992.] but if i recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). in the studies patients were given epa (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if i recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ fas that the patients could consume. from the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. if lots of n-6 fas are consumed along with the epa, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad." isn't this ratio the issue? what's the view of the gastro. community on epa these days? epa supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat -- 8-10% calories). -brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>
i have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning epilepsy and seizures. i am also interested in this subject -- i have a son with epilepsy and i am very active with the local association. i posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again. is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on epilepsy and seizures? this would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail. i already run a listserver for two other groups, so the mechanics would be easy. if you are interested, mail me a note. if i get enough replies, i will make it happen and provide you with the details. btw, i have also started a database on epilepsy. this is part of my research on natural language question answering systems. users of this service are able to ask questions about epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response. the technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before. all new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system. this database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new information. to try it out, do the following 	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca 	login: chat 	then select the epilepsy item from the menu of databases. -- andrew patrick, ph.d. communications research centre, ottawa, canada andrew@calvin.dgbt.doc.ca for a good time, run "telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca" and login as "chat".

ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year. it is still partially frozen, and i am still in physical therapy every week. but the pain has subsided almost completely. until last week when i mowed the lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row. i have a push type power mower. the pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite a while, and i used ice and medicine again. can anybody explain why this particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally, should cause this shoulder problem? thanks. alice

i am writing this to find out the following: 1.)	any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis. 2.)	the name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery. 3.)	information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer. my boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago. at that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (mylanta, tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. these treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago. he was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a nissen wrap and a "hill repair". he opted for the "hill repair". he recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva). the doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called "barrett's syndrome". if he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer? basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, i'd appreciate it. thanks, pat lydon/ netmanage, inc./ pat@netmanage.com

rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (hsp's) and dna. i hate to be derogatory, but in this case i think it's warranted. hsp's are part of the cellular response to stress. the only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock. dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce any protein- because it's dead! also, who cares if the dna you are ingesting is mutated!? it will be completely digested in your stomach, which is about ph 2. some of you worry way too much. eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax. my advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your ignorance. don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information before you do! sherry olmstead biochemist sherry olmstead title: lab technician forestry canada phone: (604) 363-0600 victoria, b.c. internet: solmstead@a1.pfc.forestry.ca

how tight are your clothes. you shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle. be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it will put pressure on the digestive tract. try laying on your sides, back, and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. easier on your legs (circulation) as well. you might try letting the baby "turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. when you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. if i had my second one to do over again i think i'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous. maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. especially if she's young. but this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible. nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. my first pregnancy was miserable. during the second i had very little trouble. some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby.

	my brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with sweet's syndrome. also called steroid resistant sweet's syndrome. 	this syndrome started after she had had iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. she'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it. 	i understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. she entered the hospital because of the sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions). i've looked through the last two years of medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and sweets. . i checked a handbook which said that sweet's was associated with leukemia. i'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in new york city or who travel to new york city. for the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology. any information that might help. apparently there hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months. -jackie-

srebrenica's doctor recounts town's living hell by laura pitter tuzla, bosnia, reuter - neret mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim town of srebrenica last august. but after treating 4,000 mangled victims of bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon. ``now i'm a surgeon with great experience although i have no license to practice. but if i operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' evacuated by the u.n. this week to his home town of tuzla, the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long serb siege of srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``i lived through hell together with the people of srebrenica. all those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters. mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in tuzla, but before going to srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. he worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug. 5 and treated 4,000 patients. he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from tuzla, 60 miles northwest of srebrenica. about 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said. his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. half of the dead were women and children. the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``there was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said. ``there were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. one woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. they had no heads.'' before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine. the six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``they didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-september he had run out of supplies. ``bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``people were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``i felt destroyed psychologically,'' mujanovic said. the situation improved after dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres. but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' then the hunger set in. between mid-december and mid-march, when u.s. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said. ``i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said. according to mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege. mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in tuzla. ``they say i'm a hero,'' he said. ``there were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when i left. and i cried too.'' -- sharon machlis gartenberg framingham, ma usa e-mail: sharon@world.std.com

(to understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection. there have been quite a few, and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.) on the other hand, i am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by suggestive clinical experience, to research it further. the doubters may be surprised. (it has happened before.) i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another.

putting aside our substantial differences, i'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this. let me explain. one of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). otherwise, she is in fine health. the discovery was made via cat scans. she then had mri scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs. biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma. one spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax. the oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago). anyway, i'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery? thanks. jon noring -- charter member --->>> infj club. if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info. ============================================================================= | jon noring | noring@netcom.com | | | jkn international | ip : 192.100.81.100 | fred's gourmet chocolate | | 1312 carlton place | phone : (510) 294-8153 | chips - world's best! | | livermore, ca 94550 | v-mail: (510) 417-4101 | | ============================================================================= who are you? read alt.psychology.personality! that's where the action is.

last year, i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia. i couldn't remember doing anything that would have caused it. that is, i hadn't been lifting more than other people do, and in fact probably somewhat less. eventually the thing became more painful and i had the repair operation. this year i developed a pain on the other side. this turned out to be another inguinal hernia. so i go back to the hospital monday for another fun 8-) operation. i don't know of anything i'm doing to cause this to happen. i'm 38 years old and i don't think i'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this. the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear when i was 37 and not really as active as i was when i was younger? does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting anything? it's rare that i lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days. is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk? of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at the computer, reading news... -- j. porter clark jpc@avdms8.msfc.nasa.gov or jpc@gaia.msfc.nasa.gov nasa/msfc flight data systems branch

the following article by columnist mike royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. i hope some of you will find it as amusing as i did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [reprinted w/o permission] "there's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries" by mike royko tribune media services on a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings is right up there. it almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10. it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa. the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money. the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians. those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be ok. how generous. how sporting. how stupid. why is this poll stupid? because it is based on resentment and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering. you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100,000-plus and get the same results. since the majority of americans don't make those bucks, they assume that those who do are stealing it from them. maybe the berlin wall came down, but don't kid yourself. karl marx lives. it's also stupid because it didn't ask key questions, such as: do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician? if those polled said no, they didn't know, then they should have been disqualified. if they gave the wrong answers, they should have been dropped. what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor? or maybe a question should have been phrased this way: "how much should a person earn if he or she must (a) get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better, and (c) spend four more years of grinding study in medical school, with the third and fourth years in clinical training, working 80 to 100 hours a week, and (d) spend another year as a low-pay, hard-work intern, and (e) put in another three to 10 years of post-graduate training, depending on your specialty and (f) maybe wind up $100,000 in debt after medical school and (g) then work an average of 60 hours a week, with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over?" as you have probably guessed by now, i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton, and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake america's health care. based on what doctors contribute to society, they are far more useful than the power-happy, ego-tripping, program-spewing, social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton's first budget is to frugality. but propaganda works. and, as the stupid poll indicates, many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs. of course doctors are well-compensated. they should be. americans now live longer than ever. but who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers, congress, or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonald's? and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self-indulgent, lard-butted, tv-gaping couch cabbages. ah, that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since. but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain, they might have been more honest if they had said: "let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have. that problem is you, my fellow american. yes, you, eating too much and eating the wrong foods; many of you guzzling too much hooch; still puffing away at $2.50 a pack; getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure. "you and your habits, not the doctors, are the single biggest health problem in this country. if anything, it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do. "in fact, i don't understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day. "so as your president, i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly. now i must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries. do as i say, not as i do." but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid, there is another solution: don't use them. that's right. you don't feel well? then try one of those spine poppers, needle twirlers, or have rev. bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit. or there is the do-it-yourself approach. you have chest pains? then sit in front of a mirror, make a slit here, a slit there, and pop in a couple of valves. you're going to have a kid? why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have (while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)? just have the kid the old-fashioned way. squat and do it. and if it survives, you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots. by the way, has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters should earn? royko is a pulitzer prize-winning columnist for tribune media services. ____________________________________________________________________________ -- ********************************************** vinay j. rao vrao@nyx.cs.du.edu **********************************************

does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly? does short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after the use of the drug? my grandmother recently had to be hospitalized and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks. although the drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance. it seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the course of just one and one-half months. i have to believe that the combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part catalysts for this. any comments? -- will estes		internet: westes@netcom.com

i've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays. in the examples i've seen, drugs were definitely involved. my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital. he was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate medications. the family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling us that none of the drugs interact. they even took the attitude that, if he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! with the help of an md friend of the family, we had all his medication discontinued. he had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug. two days later, he was his old self again. i guess there aren't many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. i don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. it is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. docs seem to believe that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. that control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances. i grant you that sometimes there's no choice. nevertheless, i suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss it with an independent doc. her problems may not be the effect of haldol at all. haldol may have been used validly, or it may have been prescribed because other medication confused her, and because the hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly. just my opinion, -larry (obviously not a doc) c.

in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals; and for deliveries for which blue cross/blue shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment (table 2). the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. based on the nhds, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. of these, an estimated 338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary cesareans. since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually. in 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. of all cesareans in 1991, 35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. in comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs (2.3 days). in 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for vbac and non-vbac vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. reported by: office of vital and health statistics systems, national center for health statistics, cdc. editorial note: the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from 1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 (3). because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births (5). moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. for example, in 1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and $4720, respectively. the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). if the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges. despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986, several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery. for example, vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). trial of labor was routinely offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page 2 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 national data are available) (9) when the vbac rate (according to nhds data) was 5.7%. the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35%, based on all women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted. to reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate. one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review process (10). other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery (4). references 1. notzon fc. international differences in the use of obstetric interventions. jama 1990;

95% confidence interval ci=0.6-4.0). eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for 1-5 years, compared with those living there less than 1 year. travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria. four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine alone, and proguanil alone. in addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. the risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 24%) (rr=0.4; 95% ci=0.2-0.9). twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet medical newsletter page 5 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets (15/99 15%) (rr=0.5; 95% ci=0.1-2.0). the risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (rr=0; upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening. as a result of this investigation, ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens. ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel. reported by: u.s. embassy health unit, kampala, uganda; office of medical svcs, dept of state, washington, d.c. malaria br, div of parasitic diseases, national center for infectious diseases, cdc. editorial note: in uganda, the increase in malaria among u.s. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-saharan africa. the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas. mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant p. falciparum; however, in some areas (e.g., thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. in africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in preventing infection with p. falciparum is 92% (1 ). mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen (3,4). chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance (e.g., southeast asia and africa). in africa, for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant p. falciparum has not been reported. country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information hicnet medical newsletter page 6 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 on the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are available from health information for international travel, 1992 (i.e., "yellow book") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. references 1. lobel ho, miani m, eng t, et al. long-term malaria prophylaxis with weekly mefloquine in peace corps volunteers: an effective and well tolerated regimen. lancet 1993;341:848-51. 2. world health organization. review of central nervous system adverse events related to the antimalarial drug, mefloquine (1985-1990). geneva: world health organization, 1991;

(swiftwater, pennsylvania). this vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart. previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose. a booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children. previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster. more than 90% of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of acthib trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/ml (4). this response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials. two u.s. efficacy trials of prp-t were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other haemophilus b conjugate vaccines hicnet medical newsletter page 8 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 for use in infants (4). in these studies, no cases of invasive hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with prp-t. these and other studies suggest that the efficacy of prp-t vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed hib vaccines. tetramune trademark on march 30, 1993, the fda approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (dtp) and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. tetramune trademark, available from lederle-praxis biologicals (pearl river, new york), combines two previously licensed products, dtp (triimmunol registered, manufactured by lederle laboratories pearl river, new york) and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (hibtiter registered, manufactured by praxis biologics, inc. rochester, new york). this vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hib disease when indications for vaccination with dtp vaccine and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide. based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, tetramune trademark is expected to provide protection against hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other dtp and haemophilus b vaccines. the advisory committee for immunization practices (acip) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). the acip also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). a complete statement regarding recommendations for use of acthib trademark and tetramune trademark is being developed. reported by: office of vaccines research and review, center for biologics evaluation and research, food and drug administration. div of immunization, national center for prevention svcs;

ethics, professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision of oral care to the hiv-positive population; salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric hiv infection; and women's issues. recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv, to establish a universal terminology for hiv-associated oral lesions, to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions, and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions. epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page 11 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 radically changed. in 1988, hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs. today, more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents. while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa, a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well. five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time. researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis. they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis. social/political issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the public's attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use. speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv-infected patients, and the need to educate the public about what aids is, and how it is acquired. saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv-inhibitory activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions. whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions. research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity. they attributed the hiv-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of hiv by saliva, which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) direct effects on the virus or target cells. other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest. with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of hiv- infected children has tripled. the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth. periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page 12 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection. recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv-infected individuals and treatment rendered by hiv-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention. factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of hiv testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hiv-infected patients. conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv infection will be held in five years or less. proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the quintessence company in late 1993. --------- end of part 1 ------------ --- internet: david@stat.com fax: +1 (602) 451-1165 bitnet: atw1h@asuacad fidonet=> 1:114/15 amateur packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na

"this drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent pregnancy," said fda commissioner david a. kessler, m.d. "as an injectable, given once every three months, depo provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose." depo provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection. if a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the injections. as with any such products, fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it. depo provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer, the world health organization and health agencies in other countries. u.s. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found depo provera effective as an injectable contraceptive. the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. in addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness or fatigue. the drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood clots in the legs, lungs or eyes. the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. hicnet medical newsletter page 14 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to osteoporosis. the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect. depo provera was developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries. the upjohn company of kalamazoo, mich., which will market the drug under the name, depo provera contraceptive injection, first submitted it for approval in the united states in the 1970s. at that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer. worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any. hicnet medical newsletter page 15 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 new rules speed approval of drugs for life-threatening illnesses p92-37 food and drug administration monica revelle - (301) 443-4177 the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses, such as aids, cancer and alzheimer's disease. "these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible," said hhs secretary louis w. sullivan, m.d. "the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration." these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. the drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. one new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddc) -- was approved june 19, using a model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, hiv, the cause of aids. accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when fda determines that a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan. "the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight," said fda commissioner david a. kessler, m.d. "while drug approval will be accomplished faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law." hicnet medical newsletter page 16 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit, if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective, or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic. hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: articles :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: research shows promise for preventing or slowing blindness due to retinal disease national retinitis pigmentosa foundation neutrophilic factors rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore, md - researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc. [nasdaq: regn] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. the degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of visual impairment this research, published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science (pnas), holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists. it is estimated that 2.5 million americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease that causes blindness. in addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. the research was funded in part by the rp (retinitis pigmentosa) foundation fighting blindness, regeneron pharmaceuticals and the national eye institute. it was conducted by drs. matthew m. lavail, kazuhiko unoki, douglas yasurnura, michael t. matthes and roy h. steinberg at ucsf, arld dr. c;eorge yancoooulos, regeneron's vice president for discovery. regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from ucsf. in the research described in the pnas , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances. experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light exposure. brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects; other factors such as nerve growth factor (ngf) and insulin-like growth factor (igf-1) were not effective in these experiments. discussing the research, dr. jesse m. cedarbaum, regeneron's director of clinical research, said, "bdnf's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, and for retinal detachment. following detachment, permanent vision loss may hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. it is possible that bdnf could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically." "retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. it is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated jeanette s. felix, ph.d., director of science for the rp foundation fighting blindness. in addition to the work described , regeneron is developing bdnf in conjunction with aingen inc. [nasdaq:amgn] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, motor neuron diseases, parkinson's disease, and alzheimer's disease. by itself, regeneron is testing cntf in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as lou gehrig's disease). regeneron pharlnaceuticals, inc., based in tarrytown, new york, is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries, which affect more than seven million americans. drs. lavail and steinberg of ucsf are consultants to regeneron. hicnet medical newsletter page 19 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 affluent diet increases risk of heart disease research resources reporter written by mary weideman nov/dec 1992 national institutes of health high-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat. these findings, according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland, have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries. "this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator dr. william e. connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university. over the past 25 years dr. connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico, while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism. these native mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua. the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing. probably as a result, coronary heart disease, which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations, is virtually non existent in their culture. loosely translated, the name tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on "kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball. the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables. the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs. their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 percent) is of vegetable origin. dietician martha mcmurry, a coinvestigator in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat. the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dl, low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl. all of those values are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers. elevated cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page 20 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 disease. hdl-cholesterol is considered beneficial. in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl- cholesterol. clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi. food was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol. fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr. connors laboratory for cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses. regular measurements included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness. thirteen tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet. "in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories. this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in fiber," elaborates dr. conners. such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index, or csi, recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr. connor. "the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet. csi indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level, particularly the ldl," dr. connor explains. the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of 20; dr. connor's "affluent" diet used in the study ranks a csi of 149. the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before exposing subjects to the experimental diet. the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat. changes in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels. "you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet. the framingham study, for example, did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat. all subjects were already eating on a plateau," dr. connor says. after 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the ldl fraction, which rose 39 percent. hdl-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little. plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in weight. according to dr. connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days. hicnet medical newsletter page 21 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations. "we think hdl-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study. in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption. in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories. we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol. hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased quite a bit in this study," dr. connor explains. low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol. hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake. dr. connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a csi around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs. such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat, high in fiber. dr. connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a "mediterranean-style" diet. "the original mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products. we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products. simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation." the world health organization (who) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development. dr. connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen. "if the pattern of afluence increases, the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, which places a termendous health care burden on a society. who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for unnecessary, expensive medical technology," dr. connors says. "the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent, excessive diet. the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago, so a lot has been accomplished. we are changing rapidly," he concludes. hicnet medical newsletter page 22 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: general announcments :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: publications for health professionals available from nci (1/93) unless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by calling the nci's publication ordering service, 1-800-4-cancer. because federal government publications are not subject to copyright restriction, you are free to photocopy nci material. general information anticancer drug information sheets in spanish/english. two- sided fact sheets (in english and spanish) provide information about side effects of common drugs used to treat cancer, their proper usage, and precautions for patients. the fact sheets were prepared by the united states pharmacopeial convention, inc., for distribution by the national cancer institute. single sets only may be ordered. cancer rates and risks, 3rd edition (85-691). this book is a compact guide to statistics, risk factors, and risks for major cancer sites. it includes charts and graphs showing incidence, mortality, and survival worldwide and in the united states. it also contains a section on the costs of cancer. 136 pages. diet, nutrition & cancer prevention: a guide to food choices (87-2778). this booklet describes what is now known about diet, nutrition, and cancer prevention. it provides information about foods that contain components like fiber, fat, and vitamins that may affect a person's risk of getting certain cancers. it suggests ways to use that information to select from a broad variety of foods--choosing more of some foods and less of others. includes recipes and sample menus. 39 pages. national cancer institute fact book. this book presents general information about the national cancer institute including budget data, grants and contracts, and historical information. hicnet medical newsletter page 23 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 national cancer institute grants process (91-1222) (revised 3/90). this booklet describes general nci grant award procedures; includes chapters on eligibility, preparation of grant application, peer review, eligible costs, and post- award activities. 62 pages. physician to physician: perspective on clinical trials. this 15-minute videocassette discusses why and how to enter patients on clinical trials. it was produced in collaboration with the american college of surgeons commission on cancer. students with cancer: a resource for the educator (91-2086).

================================================================== "properties of an hiv 'vaccine'" nature (04/08/93) vol. 362, no. 6420, p. 504 (volvovitz, franklin and smith, gale) the questions raised by moore et al. about recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv-1 produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages, write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden, conn. moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd4 receptor, and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv-1 virus does in natural infection. but vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients infected with hiv-1 broadens hiv-1 specific envelope-directed immune responses, including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and cd4 and cd8 cytotoxic t-cell responses. volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein. antibody responses against native hiv-1 proteins, including the types described by moore et al., exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page 42 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 progression of hiv disease. in addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to cd4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection. the absence of cd4 binding by the microgenesys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature. phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd4 counts, stimulation of cytotoxic t cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune function. based on these and other clinical results, microgenesys gp160 was chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iii vaccine therapy studies, conclude volvovitz and smith. ================================================================== "hiv-1 infection: breast milk and hiv-1 transmission" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 930 (mok, jacqueline) there are still more questions than answers regarding hiv-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies, writes jacqueline mok of the lancet. the anti-infective properties of milk are well documented. while the numbers of leukocytes, concentrations of lactoferrin and iga, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga. breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv-positive mothers. the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months). breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids. there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv-1 infection. studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 hiv-1 infected women showed the presence of igg and iga antibodies against envelope glycoproteins, as well as iga antibodies against core antigens. binding of hiv-1 to the cd4 receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor. in the developing world, where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality, breast milk is still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's hiv status. transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded. the possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and may even delay progression to aids, concludes mok.

269, no. 14, p. 1802 (dickinson, gordon m. et al.) if universal precautions are practiced, the risk of hiv transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write gordon m. dickinson hicnet medical newsletter page 43 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 et al. of the university of miami school of medicine in miami, fla. the researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing. living patients with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed, and dna sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist. death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. there were 1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124 were deceased. an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection, all of whom were either homosexuals or iv-drug users. the researchers were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1,048 patients, and 900 agreed to be tested. hiv infection was reported in five of the 900 patients, including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease. one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior. comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related. the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude dickinson et al. ================================================================ april 22, 1993 ================================================================ "aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb, study says" washington post (04/22/93), p. a13 tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once, which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a study published in today's new england journal of medicine. people who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again. but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new tb infection, doctors found. peter m. small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university, director of the study, said that in order to protect against reinfection, it may be necessary for some people to use tb medicines permanently. the study examined the genetic makeup of tb bacteria and how the germs changed over time in 17 patients at kings county hospital in new york. ================================================================ "hiv-1 infection: breast milk and hiv-1 transmission" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 930

957 (duesberg, peter) because there is no proof that hiv is the cause of aids, the hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically (azt) and psychologically (positive aids test) toxic public health initiatives, writes peter duesberg of the university of california-- berkeley. in the lancet's march 13 issue, schechter et al. call duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids, "a hindrance to public health initiatives." however, their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits. the u.s. government spends $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, no prevention, and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis. schechter et al. conclude that hiv has a key role in cd4 depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver. however, their survey neglects to disprove duesberg's drug- aids hypothesis, because it does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free aids cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether. to refute duesberg's hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years hiv-positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so. the 10 year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page 45 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids. alternatively, they could show that hiv-free individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get aids-defining illnesses, concludes duesberg. ================================================================ "rapid decline of cd4+ cells after ifna treatment in hiv-1 infection" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 959 (vento, sandro et al.) interferon (ifn), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings, may hasten cd4 t-cell loss in some hiv-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful "autoimmune" reactions, write sandro vento et al. of the a. pugliese hospital in catanzaro, italy. the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv-1 infected individuals with hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis (cah) who had a rapid, profound decline of cd4 cells after ifn. all three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24. sera from all three patients, obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens, homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv-1 gp41. these autoantibodies, which also recognize "native" class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd4 t cells "in vivo", were at low tires (50-100) in all three patients six months after stopping ifn. such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd4 t-cell loss in some hiv-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful "autoimmune" reactions. the subjects had a1; b8; dr3; and b35, dr1 hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd4 cell counts and clinical progression of hiv-1 disease. ifn can induce a very rapid decline of cd4 cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these hla haplotypes, the researchers conclude. ================================================================ april 23, 1993 ================================================================ "tb makes a comeback" state government news (04/93) vol. 36, no. 4, p. 6 (voit, william and knapp, elaine s.) although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the united states, it is emerging again among the homeless, aids patients, immigrants, minorities, and prisoners. dr. lee b. reichman, professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association, said, "right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's everyone's problem." the ala predicts that 10 million americans are infected with tb, and about 10 percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed, especially those with aids or hiv. gene hicnet medical newsletter page 46 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 tammes, a centers for disease control expert, said that is why the cdc has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb patients. state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment. in addition, the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services. in new york city, tb is an epidemic "because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people," said dr. george diferdinando, director of the new york state tb control. according to diferdinando, curbing the spread of tb entails keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed tb cases in treatment. about 40 percent of infected new york city residents don't complete therapy. when tb patients don't finish taking their medication, multi-drug resistant tb can develop, which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat. ================================================================ "increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in southern florida: artifact or reality?" american journal of public health (04/93) vol. 83, no. 4, p. 571 (nwanyanwu, okey c. et al.) the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in southern florida was partially related to misclassification of risk, write okey c. nwanyanwu et al. of the centers for disease control in atlanta, ga. the researchers investigated 168 such aids cases from broward and coastal palm beach counties. all of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of hiv transmission. medical records of patients, in addition to records from social services, hiv counseling and testing centers, and sexually transmitted disease (std) clinics were reviewed. if no other hiv risk factor was found from medical record review, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories. after adjustments were made for the reclassification, the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january 1, 1989, and march 31, 1990, that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33 percent to 28 percent among women. while the percentage of heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it still remained above the national average, the researchers conclude. hicnet medical newsletter page 47 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993

over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested, and of those whose results were revealed, only one person was found to be infected with hiv. the study patient's infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985. as a result, there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv-positive surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers conclude. ================================================================== april 20, 1993 ================================================================== "drug concerns to share aids data" new york times (04/20/93), p. c10 (kolata, gina) a total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a highly unusual move, to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing. dr. edward scolnick, president of the merck research laboratory in rahway, n.j., arranged the collaboration. he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone. the researchers are hopeful that hiv, when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time. therefore, several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv. currently, the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing. the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs. "an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page 39 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way," said scolnick. he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws. in creating the agreement, merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups, including act-up. dr. daniel hoth, director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said, "we're delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids." related stories: wall street journal (04/20) p. b1; philadelphia inquirer (04/20) p. a3; usa today (04/20) p. 1b ================================================================== "the next step in aids treatment" nature (04/08/93) vol. 362, no. 6420, p. 493 (maddox, john) although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv, the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full-blown aids, writes columnist john maddox. azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv-positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t-cell counts. however, a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease. while the cd4 counts of the 877 people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo, the first three years of follow-up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent. the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv-infected individuals, and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people. but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared--there is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the evidence now available. it is much more alarming that the cd4 count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection. aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease. the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids, concludes maddox. ================================================================== "infective and anti-infective properties of breastmilk from hiv-1-infected women" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 914 (van de perre, philippe et al.) a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv-1 from mother to child, write philippe van de perre et al. of the hicnet medical newsletter page 40 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 national aids control program in kigali, rwanda. the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective substances in breastmilk, or both factors. a total of 215 hiv-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali, rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum. hiv-1 igg, secretory iga, and igm were assayed by western blot, for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g. in the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers (gag, pol, and env). at 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum, hiv-1 specific igg was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 percent of breastmilk samples; iga in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; and igm in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent. in children who survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers' milk. the presence of hiv-1- infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis. the combination of hiv-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection. igm and iga anti-hiv-1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv, the researchers conclude. ================================================================== april 21, 1993 ================================================================== "firms to share aids research in global venture" journal of commerce (04/21/93), p. 7a a total of fifteen u.s. and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids. the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug. edward scolnick, president of merck & co. research laboratories, led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together, said participants. in addition to merck, the other companies involved in the inter-company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol-myers squibb co., burroughs wellcome, glaxo inc., hoffman-la roche, eli lilly & co., pfizer inc., smithkline beecham, ab astra, du pont merck, syntex inc., boehringer ingelheim, miles inc., and sigma-tau. the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively involved in hiv anti-viral development may participate. scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page 41 volume 6, number 11 april 25, 1993 and early clinical data. the american foundation for aids research (amfar) was pleased with the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance. related story: financial times (04/21) p. 1 ================================================================== "guidance over hiv-infected health-care workers" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 952 (horton, richard) the united kingdom's department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among health-care workers. following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv, the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases. dr. kenneth calman, chief medical officer, said doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic hiv testing. he said, "infected health care workers should not perform invasive procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to the virus." the guidelines --------- end of part 3 ------------ --- internet: david@stat.com fax: +1 (602) 451-1165 bitnet: atw1h@asuacad fidonet=> 1:114/15 amateur packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na

this is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots. 1. i stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder, which though sometimes true is misleading. it is not often found effective, particularly by itself. primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy. the most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this distinction becomes important. 2. i mentioned that the dsm-iiir mentions 'impulses' as a possible 	diagnostic marker. however, this might look like something 	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or 	unpredictable behaviors, which is not the case with ocd. 	one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual 	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they 	are an unending source of anxiety. 	the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 	ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to 	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part. 	some references (one non-technical and several technical) 	that someone was kind enough to supply for me 	but was unable to post themself : |"the boy who couldn't stop washing" by judith rapaport. *** 	(technical refs) : |	pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder |	donna m jermain and lynn crismon |	pharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198 |	epidemiology of ocd |	seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen |	j clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13 |	the waking nightmare: an overview of ocd |	judith l rapoport |	j clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28 |	absence of placebo response in ocd |	matig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson |	j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4 	and thanks very much to those who supplied constructive 	criticism to my first post on ocd. i hope this helps clarify 	the parts that were misleading. 						kind regards, 						todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | todd i. stark				 stark@dwovax.enet.dec.com | | digital equipment corporation		 (215) 354-1273 | | philadelphia, pa. usa | | "(a word is) the skin of a living thought" olliver wendell holmes, jr. | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. a recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on. this type of loss is difficult to fit. i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired. recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. these have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called resound. unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and i couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the widex. nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and i was impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate posting. they also carry the widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the resound even though he had purchased the widex only 6 months ago. the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the widex and other programmable aids. i could take a trip to europe on the difference! being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, i am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds. i would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if i might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive. -rich haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> university of oregon, eugene, or, usa

the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments. i would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids. the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at&t and appears to take a different approach from other aids. it appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations. the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'. this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though i think the phrase is missleading. what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge. this means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff). aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations. -rich haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> university of oregon, eugene, or, usa

[ . . . ] conclusions. in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. consequently, the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted. does this trial address every issue raised here, no. jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *sporanox* (despite crook's recommendation for nystatin). maybe they didn't avoid those carbohydrates . . . >the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to >be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. >if it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans >david? we are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider >yogurt dangerous). if this were a standard part of medical practice, as >gordon r. says it is, then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast >infections should decline. marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (elaine palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms. there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials. are we talking about "real" candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc). we can't seem to focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion. i'm lost!
this question came up in sci. med. nutrition and i'm posting my answer here. only 22 medical schools in the u.s. teach courses on human nutrition. we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. i think that the best example of where u.s. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms. so many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u.s. are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening. before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. from a poster in sci. medi. nutrition: > 	in a psychological anthropology course i am taking, we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms. some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar > intake, and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms. > 	is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey? > > many thanks, > > michael, i've wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got side-tracked with candida. pms is a lot like candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity. here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms. premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: 	pmt-a(anxiety)		pmt-d(depression) 	anxiety			depression 	irritability		forgetfulness 	insomnia		confusion 	depression		lethargy 	pmt-c(craving)		pmt-h(hyperhydration) 	craving for sweets	weight gain 	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness 	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 	 2. palpitations 	 3. fatigue or fainting pmt-a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. pmt-c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates. during the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge. the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt-c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e1. this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and pge1 seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia. 	a. am. j. psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. pmt-d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle. another cause of pmt-d has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). "effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol" fertil. steril. 28:312-18(1972). pmt-h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level. salt restriction, b6, magnesium and vitamin e for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating pmt-h this general discussion of the pms syndromes came form: 	a. "management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: rational for 	 a nutritional approach". 1986, a year in nutritional medicine. 	 j. bland, ed. keats, publishing, 1986. 	b.

"premenstrual tension", prob. obstet. gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms). while progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better. there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms(much more than candida blooms). many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). here are a few of these studies: 	carbohydrate: experimental controlled study, "effect of a low-fat, 	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" lancet 	2:128-32(1988). 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 	advise with no training. after 6 months, there was a significant 	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 	tenderness and nodularity. 	vitamin a: experimental controlled study, "the use of vitamin a in 	premenstrual tension" acta obstet. gynecol scand. 39:586-92(1960). 	218 pts with severe recurring pms received 200,000 to 300,000iu 	vitamin a daily or a placebo. serum retinol levels were monitored 	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml). the intent of the 	study was to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool 	size(500,000iu to 1,000,000iu) and then see if this 	normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms. 48% getting the high dose 	vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms. only 10% 	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms sysmptoms. 	10% of the vitamin a treated group reported no improvement in pms 	symptoms. 	experimental controlled study, "premenstrual tension treated with 	vitamin a" j. clinical endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 	received 200,000iu of vitamin a daily starting on day 15 of their 	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms. 	after 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 	pms symptoms. vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of 	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 	after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped. pms symptoms 	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 	vitamin a supplementation was stopped. most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver. these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms. of all the vitamins given for pms(vitamin a, b6, and vitamin e), vitamin a has shown the best single effect. this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver. getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms. but vitamin a is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a toxicity. 	vitamin b6: experimental double-blind crossoverr study, "pyridoxine 	(vitamin b6) and the premenstrual syndrome: a randomized crossover 	trial"j.r. coll. gen. pract. 39:364-68(1989). 32 women aged 18-49 	with moderate to severe pms randomly received 50mg b6 daily or placebo. 	after 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 	3 months. b6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 	pms(depression, irritability and tiredness). other symptoms of pms 	were not significanttly affected by b6 supplementation. 	experimental double-blind study, "the efects of vitamin b6 	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" obstet. gynecol 	70(2):145-49(1987). 55 pts with moderate to severe pms received 	150mg b6 daily or placebo for 2 months. analysis of convergence 	showed that b6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction) 	anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by b6 	supplementation. vitamin b6 is below the rda for both american men and women. birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the b6 requirement in man. women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of b6 per day. the dose should be increased if symptoms of pms appear. dr. david r. rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of nimh was quoted in clin. psychiatry news, december, 1987 as stating that b6 should be considered the "first-line" drug for pms(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried. vitamin b6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. 	vitamin e: experimental double-blind study, "efficacy of alpha- 	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" j. reprod. 	med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400iu vitamin e daily for 3 	cycles or a placebo. vitamin e treated pts had 33% who reported a 	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant 	reduction in physical symptoms. the vitamin e group reported that 38% 	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 	group. for depression, the vitamin e group had 27% with a significant 	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. 	experimental double-blind study, "the effect of alpha-tocopherol on 	premenstrual symptomalogy: a double blind study" j. am. coll. nutr. 	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and pmt randomly 	received vitamin e at 75iu, 150iu, or 300iu daily or placebo. after 	2 months of supplementation, 150iu of vitamin e or higher significantly 	improved pmt-a and pmt-c. the 300iu dose was needed to significantly 	improve pmt-d. no dose of vitamin e significantly improved pmt-h 	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin e doses will relieve 	pmt-h symptoms). 	 	magnesium: experimental double-blind study, "magnesium prophylaxis 	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" headache 	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 	placebo. treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 	continued until menstruation. after 2 months, the pain total index 	was significantly lower in the magnesium group. magnesium treatment 	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the menstrual 	distress questionnaire scores. pretreatment magnesium levels in 	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 	from pms. after treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 	into the normal range. 	experimental double-blind study, "oral magnesium successfully 	relieves premenstrual mood changes" obstet. gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 	360mg of mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 	onset of the menstrual flow. after 2 cycles, both groups received 	magnesium. the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster 	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 	switched to magnesium supplementation. in addition, the total score on 	the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by 	magnesium supplementation. the authors suggest that magnesium 	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 	that occur during pms. there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature. but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci. med. to be anecdotal in nature, i have not bothered to cite them. there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms. i've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder. but doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.). pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u.s. should get a good course on human nutrition. pms is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders. it's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing pms. 	experimental study, "effect of a nutritional programme on 	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", complement. med. 	res.5(1):8-11(1991). 200pts were given dietary instructions and 	supplemented with optivite(r) plus additional vitamin c, vitamin e, 	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil. the dietary instructions were to 	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 	diet. on a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 	improvement in their pms symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 	they no longer suffered from pms. 	experimental double-blind study, "role of nutrition in managing 	premenstrual tension syndromes", j reprod. med. 32(6):405-22(1987). 	a low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with optivite 	supplementation significantly decreased pms scores compared with diet 	change and placebo. after 6 months on the experimental program, the 	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 	phase of their cycle. 	experimental double-blind study, "clinical and biochemical effects 	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", j. 	reprod. med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given optivite(12 	tablets per day) or a placebo. the treated groups showed a 	significant decrease in pms symptoms compared to the placebo. another 	group of 104pts got optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo. for this 	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 	pms symptoms was observed. martin banschbach, ph.d.

hi, 	i'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo- genics. the drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. there are all sorts of warnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect.. 	the silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not require a change in diet. is this possible? are the pills dangerous or just hoaxes? karen
does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of available water? i had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters). i drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was dehydrated. i don't think general physical condition was an issue, since i was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina, so far as i could tell. it may be that i just plain need more water than most people. but i am wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things. i took a couple of primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma (24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline). i gather that both those drugs are diuretics. so now i'm wondering: does that mean they can reduce the body's ability to utilize available water? would it be a particularly stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise? (i always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but that wasn't the case yesterday.)

here is a press release from the american federation of state, county and municipal employees. unions point to deadly workplaces; afscme, other unions commemorate workers memorial day to: national desk, labor writer contact: janet rivera of the american federation of state, county and municipal employees, afl-cio, 202-429-1130 washington, april 23 -- the american federation of state, county and municipal employees (afscme) and other unions of the afl-cio on wednesday, april 28, will commemorate the fifth annual workers memorial day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job. this year, afscme will focus its workers memorial day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. earlier this month, an afscme corrections officer, robert vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in lucasville, ohio. the law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years. on jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994. the conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff. assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain high. in 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff, compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991. the increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing. for example in ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. the national average is 1 to 5.3. other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include aids, hepatitis b, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards. afscme has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's federal, state and local correctional facilities. correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions. every year, 10,000 american workers die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease. public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs. perilous occupations include: -- highway workers - highway workers are often injured and frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are not barricaded or don't have proper lighting. -- health care workers - hospitals have the highest number of job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector employer and nursing homes ranked fifth. there were more than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the previous year. it is generally believed that health care workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses than do their private sector counterparts. health and safety issues facing health care workers include exposure to tuberculosis and the hiv virus, back injuries, and high levels of stress. -- social workers - social workers who work in mental health institutions are often the victims of assaults and, sometimes, fatal attacks. for instance, last october, a man carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the schuyler county social services building in watkins glenn, n.y. and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the gun on himself. there are two basic problems. first is a growing lack of support services for people who don't have the help they need. because workers are overworked, some clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling. such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated. the "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent, as more are moved out of the institutions. nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since osha was passed. moreover, as afscme president gerald w. mcentee explains, osha does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees. "more than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved osha coverage for public employees," said mcentee. "this, despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers, corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society. this year we are fighting for passage of osha reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces. we need the public support to be successful." government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe. public employees were exempted from osha when the law was passed in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states have no osha coverage. -30- -- canada remote systems - toronto, ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known. anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view. and by and large, as a scientist myself, i am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment. however, as also being a human being (last i checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations. after all, the underlying intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment. what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints. in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that. the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then). the patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor. it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient. and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community: either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training. this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way. everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - i'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. hopefully what i write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why i am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why i have real difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure "scientific" approach to medicine. i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and by the "scientific" aspects. anything else is just not good medicine, imho. just my 'nf' leanings, i guess. :^) comments? jon noring -- charter member --->>> infj club. if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, i'll send info. ============================================================================= | jon noring | noring@netcom.com | | | jkn international | ip : 192.100.81.100 | fred's gourmet chocolate | | 1312 carlton place | phone : (510) 294-8153 | chips -

"this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it," said dr. ruth berkelman, deputy director of the cdc's national center for infectious diseases. there were more cases of malaria in the u.s. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s, and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic, the first in this century, she said. resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. "we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past" berkleman said. she said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment. "despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states," the cdc said. it cited the emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly identified pathogens and syndromes, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis c virus; hiv, the virus that causes aids; legionnaires disease; lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome. "the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas," the cdc said. it said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance. =====*===== source: wall street journal reference: 04/15/93, pb1 headline: lyme-disease ruling raises liability issues the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability. a federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. the decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property. the decision by u.s. district judge robert j. ward in new york came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the long island railroad. judge ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. he ordered the new york state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical expenses and lost wages. summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says stephen l. kass, an attorney at new york law firm berle, kass & case, who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable. lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. a summer vacationer in southampton, n.y., last year sued the owner of the home she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky mountain spotted fever. in 1988, also on long island, a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. the judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant. but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the country -- it's most prevalent in new england, the middle atlantic states, wisconsin, minnesota and the northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one. the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease. lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. payments in worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and lost earnings. the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of negligence. unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease. ira m. maurer, a partner at new york law firm elkind, flynn & maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against lyme disease." lawyers caution that despite judge ward's decision, winning a lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult. for one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. judge ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten. the workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites. a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. the railroad also disputes judge ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees. the spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites. debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. earlier this week, the journal of the american medical association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease. and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes. because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against lyme disease. last year, at its headquarters in franklin lakes, n.j., becton, dickinson & co. began using damminix, a pesticide made by ecohealth inc. of boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. the medical- supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected. ruth lister, a spokeswoman for the american camping association in indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. and carole katz, a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of new york with the tick-killing pesticide. =====*===== title: urinary dysfunction in lyme disease. authors: chancellor mb; mcginnis de; shenot pj; kiilholma p; hirsch ih, department of urology, jefferson medical college, thomas jefferson university, philadelphia, pennsylvania. reference: j urol 1993 jan; 149 (1): 26-30 lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae. we describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2. detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient. we observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of lyme disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract. in 1 patient bladder infection by the lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy. neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted. relapses of active lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common. urologists practicing in areas endemic for lyme disease need to be aware of b. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended. iv. *****

my ent doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses. i have a very deviated nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures). one side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow. of course i have known this for years but recently discovered that i suffer from chronic sinus infection, discovered during an mri after a severe migraine. a ct scan subsequently confirmed the problems in the sinuses. he wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty. he explained the procedure, and the risks. what i would like to know is if there is anyone out there who can tell me "i had this surgery, and it helped me"? (i've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't really help them). i am a moderately severe asthmatic. ent doc says large percentage see some relief of their asthma after sinus surgery. also he said it is not unheard of that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved. i am 42. any relevant information is appreciated. regards, jay keller sunnyvale, california badboy@netcom.com

i think you must have the same hygiene teacher i had in 1955. there is a story about the civil war about a soldier who was shot in the groin. the bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby. later, when she (a young woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her. according to this story, they lived happily ever after. perhaps the most famous of mr. rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel (tapering from about 3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length). he would say, "boys, do you know what this is? it's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's used to unclog your penis when you have vd. they just ram it up there without an anesthetic!" needless to say this had a chilling effect. i didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour. later in life as i perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used, i could not escape thinking that i might one day see, "reamer, cock (style of rau) ." ]

first off, if i'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat, not humans. secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol. this is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation. put in layman's terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be turned into heat. 2,4-dnp was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction. in controlled amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available. it is very dangerous. it would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than play around with 2,4-dnp. but if you insist, i suggest you look up the literature in your own university library. you can obtain 2,4-dnp by taking a first year organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's a commonly-used reagent).

recently i've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition. in particular, dr. bernard jenssen in his book "colon cleansing for health and longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree. he also plugs a unique appliance called the "colema board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics. it sells for over $100 from a california-based company. he also plugs vitra-tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness. if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the colema board and related products, i'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience. this article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification. -- eli -- /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\ ![wiesel@cs.yale.edu] elisha wiesel, davenport college '94 yale university! ![wiesel@minerva.cis.yale.edu] (203) 436-1338<-school (212) 371-2756<-home! \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

flame on reading through the posts about kirlian (whatever spelling) photography i couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the narrow-minded, "i know it all", "i don't believe what i can't see or measure" attitude of many people out there. i am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as i'm concerned, it is just as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis. i am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something, anything, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame of reference. history shows that many great people, great scientists, were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics. especially the usa should be grateful; after all, columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth. flame off, or end sermon :-) -- alex
dear netters: maybe one of you can explain this. from time to time i experience a strange kind of feeling (i have all kinds of weird feelings) which can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one experiences in a descending elevator. needless to say, it is not enjoyable. it sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. it lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts that long, it makes me sweatening. initially i called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until i later learnt that the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats. so, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am i a stragne person? i always believe i am unique. thanks. ping

does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a man's vasectomy on his female partner? i've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health, but what about women? for example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for, say, cervical cancer? adverse effects from sperm antibodies? changes in the vagina's ph? yeast or bacterial infections? outside of study results, how about informed speculation? thanks in advance for your help! -- eric skagerberg <eskagerb@nermal.santarosa.edu> santa rosa, california telephone (707) 573-1460

i'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better. i applied to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to hear from the other school. let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process. numbers (gpa, mcats) are not everything, but they are probably more important than anything else. in fact, some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities. of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee. but, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically. you mentioned one response, was it an acceptance, denial, or wait-list? if i assume the worst, that it was a denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere. how did your interviews go? as for how long you have to wait, i've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything. many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if i haven't heard by now, i can assume a denial. many rejection letters are not sent out until may or as late as june. but some schools are still interviewing. i really don't think you should worry. don't become fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself. what do people think of the medical school admissions process? i had a very mediocre gpa, but high mcat scores, and i have been working as a software engineer for two years. i majored in computer science at stanford. still, i think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this: very important -------------- gpa:	3.5 or better mcat: top 15% in all subject medium importance ----------------- writing/speaking ability maturity motivation for going into medicine activities less important -------------- college or university major work experience anything else you want them to know anyway, you are in good shape. i think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each person as an individual. sometimes thats just not practical. but getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers. hopefully, you were able to impress them with your character. good luck, jeff

i used to be on lopid. it did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214), as well as ldl and triglycerides. then, i got pneumonia, and for some reason, the lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared. the levels might have stabilized over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch to mevicore. on mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207, ldl was 108, and hdl was 35; but the trig's were still very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, sgot = 83 (n = 1-35), ggtp(?hard to read copy) = 42 (n = 0 - 35). he said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures. he had me stop the mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("just to be extra cautious, though i'm sure it's not a problem."), and wants me to go back on it after that. i suggested maybe lopid might be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what i want to do. but lopid has one particular side effect i'm not fond of. should the above liver and trig figures be feared? what happens to folks with high trig levels? is my liver in danger with the above results? would i be better off on lopid, despite its inconvenient side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i shoulda went into more detail... being my anxiety level is peaking and you folks have no clue who i am i may as well post the specifics and see what you people think regarding my previous post. to recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were md and 4 do. as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 md and 2 do), the results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 md and one do) 3 schools i heard nothing from at all. i have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no info whatsoever to tell me. i have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles and a few "safety" (funny that most of my safety schools were the first to reject me) my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were r7 p9 b10 wq and r7 p9 b11 wr i couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art history, politics etc ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience. i cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. what percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average? i felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the mailbox anxiety? if you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments for me feel free to send them down... typing is a form of anti-anxiety thereapy hehehehe :) -- /\ _ /\ | felix the cat | 0 0 |-------\== the wonderful, wonderful cat! \==@==/\ ____\ | =============================== meow!--- \_-_/ || || hoss@panix.com

very good.
can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems: first, i was recently diagnosed (using a ugi series) as having a schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. as i understand it, the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though i do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. the schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. in particular, if i'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. this results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort. my doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. i would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. also, can anyone comment on safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? has it become a common procedure? i am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this, especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation, reaction to anesthesia). the second issue: for the past 3-4 years i have had a large number of "extra" heartbeats. in particular, during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a holter monitor recently showed 50 pvc's in 24 hrs, along with a few pac's. (many days, there are far more than this, however-five to ten per hour). all of them were isolated, and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was "normal". it certainly doesn't feel normal. in the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. i am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or caffeine, etc. i'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. the number of pvc's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). also, if i get up after sitting or lying down for a while, i tend to get a couple of extra beats. could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? both seemed to develop at about the same time. thanks for any help/advice! =============================================================================== ===============================================================================

a student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection. she was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all this time. during her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents' hmo clinic, she said that about forty! x-rays were made of her kidney. when she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she says that about five x-rays were made from each angle. she couldn't help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something. she is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained. when nobody would, she got worried. 	also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until august or so. it is now april... she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids. but she has to go to classes. she wonders why they have given her no medicine. she plans to call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions. but i told her i would also write in to sci.med and see what i could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care. she does plan to get a second opinion, too. 	i will pass info on to her. it never hurts to get information from more than one source. you can e-mail me or post. thanks. alice

here is a press release from huntington medical research institutes. new method for diagnosing alzheimer's disease discovered at huntington medical research institutes: results to be reported to: national desk, health writer contact: john lockhart or belinda gerber, 310-444-7000, or 800-522-8877, for the huntington medical research institutes. los angeles, april 28 -- a new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the huntington medical research institutes (hmri) in pasadena, calif. results of their research will be reported in the may issue of the scientific journal, radiology. using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs), a research team led by brian d. ross, m.d., d. phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with special software developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs. clinical proton mrs is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes. an automated version of clinical proton mrs called proton brain examination (probe) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes. by comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing for alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy. in addition to alzheimer's disease, the new clinical proton mrs exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including aids-related dementia, parkinson's disease and huntington's disease. "we've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fitted with either the mrs or probe software," said dr. ross, adding, "this will help physicians to diagnose alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain." dr. ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (mi) acted as a marker in the study. in comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in mi, while their level of another chemical called n-acetylaspartate (naa) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease. current drug therapy for alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate. this is attributable, dr. ross believes, to the theory that alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. this belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine. "physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease. for this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said bruce miller, m.d., a noted neurologist at harbor-ucla, mrs researcher and a co-author of the study. other members of the hmri research team included rex a. moats, ph.d., truda shonk, b.s., thomas ernst, ph.d., and suzanne woolley, r.n. the probe software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 general electric mri units currently in use in the united states, and will be configured for other manufacturers' mri units soon. for interviews with dr. ross, advance copies of the radiology may issue, and other information, please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for hmri at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877. q & a on alzheimer's disease: what is alzheimer's disease and how is it caused? alzheimer's disease (ad) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the german neuropathologist alois alzheimer. as the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death. how many people does it affect? alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the united states and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year. while alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families. ad is the most common cause of dementia in adults. symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset. what are its signs and symptoms? although the cause of ad is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition. the risk of developing ad is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90. in patients with familial ad, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing ad. one of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness" caused by short-term memory loss. dr. herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university says "whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and suggests the following criteria: -- forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal. -- forgetting the name of a loved one is serious. -- forgetting where you left your keys is normal. -- forgetting how to get home is serious. doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. -30- -- canada remote systems - toronto, ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

[...] b > marty b. marty, i personally wouldn't be so quick and take that nejm article on kidney stones as gospel. first of all, i would want to know who sponsored that study. i have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from local newspapers, magazines, to tv-guide, with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the dairy industries. there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. secondly, were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition? the study didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large- ly calcium." perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. it wouldn't be the first time. sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention of kidney stones. i, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an increase in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a phosphorus-raising approach instead! ron roth ===================================================================== -- internet: rn.3228@rose.com - rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton -- * a stone on the ground is better than a stone in the body. --- rosereader 2.10 p003228 entered at [rosehamilton] rosemail 2.10 : usenet: rose media - hamilton (416) 575-5363

how about going to a doctor to get some minor surgery done. doctor refuses to do it because it's ``to risky'' (still charges me $50!). i go home and do it myself. no problem. the ``surgery'' involved digging out a pine needle that had buried itself under my tongue. mike

actually i am entering vet school next year, but the question is relevant for med students too. memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass memorization -- i am a little concerned. as i am sure most med students are. can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization? i have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things. but i have never applied them to large amounts of "data". has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or cheap software? can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques? being an older student who returned to school this year, organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success. please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material conceptually. i have no problem with that, it is one of my strong points. but you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization. thanks for your help.
there have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological (esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games (e.g. nintendo). apparently, there have been reported several cases of "photosensitive epilepsy", due to the flashing of some patterns and the strong attention of the (young) players. one poster to comp.risks reported some action from the british government. a quick search in a database reported the following two published references: 1. e.j. hart, nintendo epilepsy, in new england j. of med., 322(20), 1473 2. tk daneshmend et al., dark warrior epilepsy, bmj 1982; 284:1751-2. i would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail) any reference to (preferably published) further work on the subject. any pointer to other information and/or to possible technical tools (if any) for reducing the risks are appreciated. many thanks, antonella d'alessandro, pisa -- italy.

as i recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain. either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have to be extracted surgically. when i was in, the x-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less. demerol worked, although i nearly got arrested on my way home when i barfed all over the police car parked just outside the er. 	- brian

appreciate it. lida, i can emphasize with your situation. both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression. her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy. lida, i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist). when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it. i had "cured" her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well. it didn't work and she was put on prozac by her oncologist. two winters ago(three years after by wife's breast cancer) i got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor). i tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation. didn't work. my internist ended up putting me on prozac. i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using b6, niacin, folate and b12 to "cure" depression. i'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like i was. lida, i do believe that depression can have a dietary component. but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will "fix" the problem. for chemotherapy, i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected. same thing for pms. i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good. depression is just too complicated. what you really need is a nutritional scan. this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves. for every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin c), you have a reserve. the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology. stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals. this is when your reserves become very important. lida, without your permission, i'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci. med. where i'm coming from. i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical schools for ten years now. i've written my own textbook because none was available. what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry. i preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons). here is what i cover: indroduction and carbohydrates 			lipids proteins i					proteins ii energy balance					evaluation of nutritional 						status i, a clinical 						perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii, evaluation of nutritional		 a biochemical perspective			status iii, homework 						assignment using the 						nutritionist iv diet and 						fitness analysis software 						program weight control					food fads and facts age-related change in nutrient requirements	food additives, 						contaminants and cancer drug-nutrient interactions			mineral and water balance sodium, potassium and chloride			calcium, magnesium and 						phosphorus iron						zinc and copper iodine and fluoride				other trace minerals vitamin a					vitamin e vitamins d and k				vitamin c thiamin and niacin				riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acids			biotin and b12 other nutrient factors				enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook. i last did this in the summer of 1991. i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217, 237 and 122 pages. opposite each page of written text(which i write myself) i've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources. since this material is only being used for educational purposes, i can get around the copyright laws (so far). i can not send this material out to newsgroup readers(as i've been asked to do). i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab. this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete. this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans. the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients. cancer treatment centers of america, which is a private for-profit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahoma(tulsa) also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab. i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setup. for physicians reading this post, i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published(feb) by mosby. i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics(a little brown series book) as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training. two m.d's have written this new clinical nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient's nutritional status. let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new text: "so-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice." "unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutrition." "but times and medical practice have changed. more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related." "... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system." roland l. weinsier, md, drph lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run. menopause is often a time when women suffer depression. there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms. a nutritionist may also be able to help. not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium reserve). most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified. there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated. checks of these labs using certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on. if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under clia(the clinical laboratory improvement act). a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis(nutritionist iv and other software programs). but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the u.s. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression. martin banschbach, ph.d. professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine "without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance."
hi stephen ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties. too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some hearing problems. it is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physician's office. you can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% otc hydrogen peroxide. then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and firmly expell the solution. depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses. if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-). you can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever you may have. if wax is old, it will be harder, and darker. you can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax. do this for a couple days, then try syringing again. it is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse it out. good luck -heather

kidney stone posts. kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart disease and cancer. when i give dietary advise, it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or sci. med. nutrition where i do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor. nothing can be further from the truth. kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out. but once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what i'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor. you have to go. hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why i'm here). when my wife detected a lump in here breast i didn't say, don't worry my vitamin e will take care of it. any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, plan and simple. if it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. but let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done). her gynocologist even scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsa). one more thing, i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist. this group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease. there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body. but you talk about flying blind, man this is really blind treatment. no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used. i'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money, it may well be. but my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan, the two m.d's who wrote the new clinical nutrition textbook. my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress. that's where i'm coming from folks. blast away if you want, i'm not going to change. put me in your killfile if you want, i really don't care. i'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that i've got something important to say. but i'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind. that's life. chromium is one of the trace elements. it has a very limited(but very important) role in the body. it is used to form glucose tolerance factor (gtf). gtf is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine and glutamic. only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form gtf. some foods already have gtf(liver, brewers or nutritional yeast, and black pepper). when chromium is in gtf, a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%). but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest for all the minerals). i've been posting in misc. fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a "fat burner". chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm. i wouldn't do it though. the adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day. the average american is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet. chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency. i can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but i'm not going to because for each positive one, there also seems to be a negative one as well. i'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability. when yeast(gtf) is used, good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative. in addition to type ii diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising. glucoma is a little more interesting. muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function. if this eye focusing activity is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated. in a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium. j. am. coll. nutr. 10(5):536,(1991). but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements. for one thing, just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast). since glucoma is often found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the rbc's. if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would prompt some attention. i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma. you could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis. most clinical labs are not going to run a rbc chromium. there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you, but i wouldn't use them. there is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now. here's weinsier and morgan, advise on chromium. they do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs). this has to change and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum, it will. what then do they suggest? make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation). once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of crcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day. what's my advise? don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way). if you want to take them and then exercise, that would be great. do include yeast as part of your diet(most americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet). if you do have a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status. when he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say, please get a copy of weinsier and morgan's new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance. if you can't do that, i'll find a doctor who can, thank you very much. marty b.

"candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter. the risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis." neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection. poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. your assessment of candidiasis in the u.s. is correct and i do not dispute it. what i posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic infection. these blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (gi tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity). knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms. let me quote from zinsser's again: "however, some factors, such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections". i was addressing mucosal infections (i like the term blooms better). the nutrition course that i teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure". i guess that your nutrition course does not, too bad. >>here is a brief primer on yeast. yeast infections, as they are commonly >>called, are not truely caused by yeasts. the most common organism responsible >>for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a >>yeast-like fungus. > > well, maybe i'm getting picky, but i always thought that a yeast > was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the > mold form. many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, > depending on environment. candida exibits what is known as > reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues > but exists as a yeast in the environment. should we maybe > call it a mold infection? a fungus infection? maybe we > should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus. > >> >>martin banschbach, ph.d. >>professor of biochemistry and chairman >>department of biochemistry and microbiology >>osu college of osteopathic medicine >>1111 west 17th st. >>tulsa, ok. 74107 >> > > you're the chairman of biochem and micro and you didn't know > that a yeast is a form of a fungus? (shudder) > or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying? my, my elisabeth, do i detect a little of steve dyer in you? if you noticed my faculty rank, i'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist. candida is classifed as a fungus(according to zinsser's). but, as you point out, it displays dimorphism. it is capable of producing yeast cells, pseudohyphae and true hyphae. elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you. to a biochemist, it's a lot of greek. so i called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me. you know elisabeth, i still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in people in sci. med. and i must admitt that i got sucked into the mud slinging too. i keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what i've said, that it will make sense. i'm not asking anyone here to buy into "the yeast connection" book because i don't know what's in that book, plain and simple. and to be honest with you, i'm beginning to wish that it was never written. marty b.

biological alchemy ( another form of cold fusion ) ( alternative heavy element creation in universe ) a very simple experiment can demonstrate (prove) the fact of "biological transmutations" (reactions like mg + o --> ca, si + c --> ca, k + h --> ca, n2 --> co, etc.), as described in the book "biological transmutations" by louis kervran, [1972 edition is best.], and in chapter 17 of the book "the secret life of plants" by peter tompkins and christopher bird, 1973: (1) obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same kind. [some kinds might work better that others.] (2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) separately incinerate both groups. (5) weigh the residue from each group. [the residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least several percent more than the other group.] (6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content. [some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been transmuted into heavier mineral elements by fusing with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..] biological transmutations occur routinely, even in our own bodies. ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can speed healing of broken bones via the reaction si + c --> ca, (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). some mineral deposits in the ground are formed by micro- organisms fusing together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. the two reactions si + c <--> ca, by micro-organisms, cause "stone sickness" in statues, building bricks, etc.. the reaction n2 --> co, catalysed by very hot iron, creates a carbon-monoxide poison hazard for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). some bacteria can even neutralize radioactivity! all of these things and more happen, in spite of the currently accepted "laws" of physics, (including the law which says that atomic fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures.)

(iv) this means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein. after a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer. the radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it. as far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the iv line. what the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer. this is also why i was wondering if your mother has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system. i hope i have answered some of your questions. feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care. i'm a newly graduated nurse, and i enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before. my thoughts are with you both. elisa b. hanson (picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu) "the chief function of the body is to carry the head around." --albert einstein
	for a very long time i've had a problem with feeling really awful when i try to get up in the morning. my sleep latency at night is also pretty long, ranging from 30 min to an hour. i get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends. i will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can, because i feel so tired when i wake up, even more tired than i was when i went to bed, which is usually too tired to work. 	anyway, i recently had a really bad flu, so i called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got vicks formula 44m which has everything but an expectorant. so i used that anyway, and the three nights i used it, i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i got really good quality sleep -- that is, i actually felt refreshed the next morning. 	so, i am now trying to look into, both in the literature and experimentally, the use of antihistamines as sleep aids, since i am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect. the antihistamine in vicks formula 44 is chloriphenamine maleate, so i bought some generic tablets of that, and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement. i might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect. also, library research seems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible otc. so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that; the pdr seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. 	for other medical information, i have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in new mexico. i also have chronically dry eyes, which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants. i did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia, so i made some changes in my diet consistent with that, and it didn't help, so i went back to a normal diet (pretty diverse, also taking vitamin supplements) 	anyway, i am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids, and if there are any dangers of such use (seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions). i don't want to try bzs, because bz addiction seems to be a serious threat, and from what i hear, bz sleep quality is not good, whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me. i have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff, and that also seems to lower sleep quality, i seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00. also, i would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem.

i've had cold sores in the past. but they have always been in the corner of my mouth. recently, i've had what appears to be a cold sore, but on my lower lip in the middle (above the chin). can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth (or body)? is there a medical term for cold sore? -- ralph yozzo (yozzo@watson.ibm.com) from the beautiful and historic new york state mid-hudson valley.
hi. my wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness to gaining weight. she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). the last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, but i haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) my questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development? i can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and i will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic. i don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives, i am just relaying events as they have happened. sincerely, erik a. wolff

a friend was recently admitted to north carolina memorial hospital because of suspected meningitis. serious business. they wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a ct scan is a prerequisite. i arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the ct. she was in tears. evidently the technicians in the ct lab had been very unpleasant to her. to begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation. imagine this. you worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you. i believe this is inexcusable. she waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger. next they inserted, or tried to insert, an iv catheter. apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain. the technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation. is there anything i can do about these pigs ? i realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out. and that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. but this is simply no excuse. their purpose for existing is to help sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. fortunately my friend is fine. but i imagine a large proportion of the people who get ct scans are not fine at all. they have cancer and that sort of thing. they don't need this kind of shit. also, since i named the hospital involved, i should also point out that neither she nor i have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at ncmh. thanks for listening, john eyles jge@cs.unc.edu

robert, i'm *so* glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion. i've been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci. med. i didn't know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts(just like i haven't read "the yeast connection"). let me just start by stating that the authors of the "cold fusion" papers of recent years are now in scientific exile(i believe that one has actually left the country). scientific fraud is rare. i'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation. your sources do not seem to be research articles. they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food combining and life extension texts). robert, i try to keep an open mind. but some things i just can't buy(one is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body). your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before). unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees i believe), you will get organic residue in the ash. even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue. i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i'm really guessing at 600 degrees f, it may actually be much higher. the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce *only* a mineral ash. they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and in our soil. are these fusion reactions? yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics. do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon? not in my book robert. silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet. i've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form. i like reading science fiction, as many people do. but i know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to separate the fiction from the fact. silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans. we have several grams of the stuff in our body. what's it doing there? only the lord knows right now. but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium). almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue(collagen and elastin). there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans). for bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts. a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation. this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone. a vitamin c deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing. zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing. and so is silicon(in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium). for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick. but robert, i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press(and yes even some scientific papers). is the explanation reasonable? without a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any better). if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, i'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion). if the idea(like a candida bloom) seems to make sense to me, i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i'm going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up. if this makes us kindred souls robert, then i guess i'll have to live with that label. for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert's interesting post, i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u.s. tv. i can't remember the network or his name(like many nights, i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in our den where i have my computer setup). this neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words). he says that he has a 70% success rate. the one case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional treatment). he was going to go in and cut. you guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals. what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys? i'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer(like jon) and the chronic gi sufferer(like elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments? treatments which do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?). is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? how about quality of life guys? may the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue). marty b.

i've sent gordon r. my posts on protein, vitamin c and vitamin a prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy. somehow i've managed to delete my vitamin a post from my text file. gordon r. had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so i'll just retype it. since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all day for that pms post), i'm not going to cite any references(gordon r. has them). i'm going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan's new nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to point out that what i'm going to say has some support in the medical community. diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long time. protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. now i'm going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u.s. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin a). when vitamin a was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin. many people(linus pauling being one) have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c (which i've already covered). big mistake(in my opinion). vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well. it's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite). vitamin a comes in two completely different forms(retinol and beta-carotene). retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic. both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%). the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(rbp). a normal human adult liver should have 500,000iu to 1,000,000iu of retinol stored. we are born with 10,000iu in our liver. u.s. autopsy has shown that about 30% of americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin a as they were born with. if you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you. but if you believe(like i do) that the nutrient reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u.s. the u.s. rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1,000 re or 5,000iu of vitamin a. for adult feamles its 800 re or 4,000iu of vitamin a. diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a (either retinol or beta-carotene) from their diet. but the nrc(national research council) was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised(c to 90mg per day and a to 7,500iu per day for adult males). that report and it's recommendations was killed. why? concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason. rdas are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient reserves full. many scientist in the u.s. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress. the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill the reserves). we know from autopsy that only about 10% of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve(500,000iu to 1,000,000iu). i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. but for vitamin a, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how much somebody has stored. we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it's time to stop taking retinol). the normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl. hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(interpretation of diagnostic test, wallach, m.d., a little brown series book). this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity. weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach, as you will see later in this post. between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain). i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full. you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin a for pms studies). beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol. but taking beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up(i've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000iu). one other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc. in addition, the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a. now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection? the body uses vitamin a(retinol) for many different things. vision(the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin a. reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal. infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid. how do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid? you use enzymes, one of which requires vitamin c(this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin a). vitamin c does play a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid. if you increase your intake of vitamin c, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid. but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body. this is why the 1985 nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda's. most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves. if they don't have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a, they actually do themselves more harm than good. retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. in the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system. the mucus membrane is referred to as the "first line" defense against infection. for cancer, retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide). cancer has two distinct steps, dna alteration and cell promotion. for cells that normally divide all the time, promoters are not that important. but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process. this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene. chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate. i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a(along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection). i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa, when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa(ou's branch campus) and when i give cme lectures. dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000iu of retinol. the serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000iu. asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled out). in one study done on u.s. spanish-americans where serum retinol levels were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl. as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u.s. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels. what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a? here are excerpts from their book: vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth. protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin a. retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision. the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum. the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl. lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores. serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a. dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children. rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state. the bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected. a daily intake of more than 7.5mg(about 37,000iu) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg(100,000iu) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois (bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue. they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults. their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative. i recommend that my students try 25,000iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection. they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run(or if their clinical lab can't run it, i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest, give them the zinc along with the vitamin a. at 25,000iu per day, toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol. both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a. recall that the pms papers were using 100,000iu to 200,000iu of vitamin a. i don't suggest that my students use these high doses. if you wanted to fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the serum retinol level, then you would be okay. but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that 25,000iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good) without having to worry about toxicity. if they want to get more agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol. but vitamin a(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus. the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18,000iu of retinol per day. beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus. could just taking beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help? yes but the effect will take a long time to develop. my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full. vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors. but when we have the m.d.'s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress, i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation. marty b.

i am quite near sighted. i've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. in my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well. my right eye seems fine. in my left eye i was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour. the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. he says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment. i am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. the dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide. of most interest to me: if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action? if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect afterwards. do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm. many thanks bill -- bill wilder, computer systems manager kentville research station agriculture canada kentville, nova scotia

(although i've already tried >many of the non-pharmacological solutions) well, i think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis. their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. antihistamines like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or doxylamine (unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally. chlorpheniramine (chlor-trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people. both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning. -- steve dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer

but after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start to have a paradoxical effect? i used to take one every night for allergies and couldn't figure out why i developed bad insomnia. finally figured out it was the antihistamines. i would fall asleep for a few minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not get back to sleep. i don't have that problem since i stopped the antihistamines at bedtime. ? alice

how is it that placebos are legal? it would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever), there's a few legal complications that arise: 	1. if you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice. 	2. a placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?) 	3. getting what you pay for.

(these were in 1983 and 1985) burzynski claims that a-10 is the active factor common to all of a-1 and a-5 (something which he has not shown, a-10 has only been extracted from a-2. he also hasn't shown that a-1 through a-5 are actually distinct substances). the nci conducted a series of tests using a-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. a-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested. it is necessary to process a-10 since it is not soluble (burzynski's theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to pag (which he calls as 2.5). pag is not an information carrying peptide, something which byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity. as 2.1 (also derived from a-10) is a 4:1 mixture of pa and pag. pa (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. a-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. the nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known. in spite of this similarity, a-10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy. many of burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early research, past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue. sdb --- sdb@ssr.com

(always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.) the answer to question 2 is rather simpler. if all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it. ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals. ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners. studies are done and papers are published. some of them are even positive. the word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one. licensed by whom? for what? it is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (foxglove and willow spring to mind). it is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology, and i suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means "(licensed herbologist) and iridologist". btw, the usual term is "herbalist". why use a different word? -- paul johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).	 | tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245 --------------------------------------------+---------------------------------- these ideas and others like them can be had | gec-marconi research is not for $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions

(this is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med. set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or (e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.) i have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. last summer i couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. i am asking for advice on how to repel wasps. this year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. the caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. last year we couldn't find any nest. even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. is there anything i can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, i want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else. would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? the wasps seem to come to drink at them, and i suppose that their prey will breed in them. the black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath. even when i am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they seem to love me. the advice i usually get when i ask what to do about wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. i've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. i have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. they still love me, and come for me, even when i'm in the middle of a crowd. so far only two things seem to work: to kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows. nb: i don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps. patronizing advice redirected to /dev/null. --ceci -- =====ceci@lysator.liu.se=========================================== "the number of rational hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is infinite." phaedrus' law from rm pirsig's _zen_and_the_art_of_motorcycle_maintenance_

i posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity". i now think it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of electricity. it is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful. another thing. when you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed. then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh. so, you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens. (note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.) this roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body. "shiver" is not the word. it may be called a mild vibration or quake. what is this shiver and roam? can i use this to induce out-of-body experience? 					daniel chung (mr.), u.s.a.
hello all, there is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and i would appreciate any help at all with it. my friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring antidepressants for a cure. the main problem is the side effects of these. so far she has been prescribed prozac, aurorix, and tryptanol all with different but unbearable side effects. the prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to sit still for more than a minute or so. the aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. her brain was clouded over. the tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- ordination occurred. she did not know what she was doing as her brain was "closed down". has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next step? thankyou in advance. gordon taylor e-mail: blubird@penguin.equinox.gen.nz

without restating the thread going here..... zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant. it is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error, but if it is any help, there are a lot of people using the side effects of the many medications to help manage other conditions. hang in there, maybe someday a "brain chemistry set" will be available and all the serotonin questions will have answers. please, no flames........i have enough to deal with :)

our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care. he was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once. now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month. most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4. i know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we are beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are, and what we can do to build up his resistance. he really enjoys his day care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny. are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions? -- how often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? how often do they get colds, flus, ear infections? is there any data on home care vs. day care? -- does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it not have any long term effect? -- does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects? -- how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal, and what does one do about it? -- is there any way to build immunity and resistance? any data, information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated. thanks a lot. ashwin.
i've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the greater volume. my internist, who diagnosed my av block, slow heart rate and pvc's, told me something different. she says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its size. exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. the av block, she asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. pvc's are also common in runners. so my ekg puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients. isn't that strange, though? are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart? is it all good? not worried, just curious, -larry c.

i have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes (type ii, i guess--no insulin). i've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain. for myself, i'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet i use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much interest, like bread on the waters. with this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband. all i can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible. meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a balanced diet. it's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which- parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty. is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly understood? is it just that i'm used to pediatrician-talk ("it's strep; give him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high? bonita kale

organization: temple university x-newsreader: nnr/vm s_1.3.2 last week i went to see a gastroenterologist. i had never met this doctor before, and she did not know what i was there for. as soon as i arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. they told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? i don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when i've gone to a new doctor, i met him with my clothes on. first, he introduced himself, asked what i was there for and took a history, all before i undressed. are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? personally, i'd prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. if nothing else, it minimizes the time that i have to spend in the self conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed. does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk attitude as insensitive? also, is it unusual? james arbuckle email: v5113e@vm.temple.edu
