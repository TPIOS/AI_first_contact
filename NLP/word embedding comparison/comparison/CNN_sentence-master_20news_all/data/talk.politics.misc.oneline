(rd patients in the va system in spokane, for example, must travel to seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.) the bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers. claims that "government bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account. jsh > >=mark -- steve hendricks | domain: steveh@thor.isc-br.com "one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - r. hofferbert | ma bell: 509 838-8826
replying to a.j. teel: 	well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the 	income tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for 	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a 	while now. humbug. those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations. specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness). this issue is sufficiently important that i think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the us supreme court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax). unless you can do that, i for one am unwilling to call your material "concrete proof". 	there has been no refutation to date. have the nay-sayers 	finally given up as defeated? sure would like to hear their 	reasons for disbelief at this point. refutation?? refutation of what? you haven't made a case yet. you've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the us will agree with you. your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that i feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever. and the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that i see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the supreme court. why can't you just cite us a case in which joe schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the us supreme court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary? what, you say? no such case exists? hmmm, i wonder why not; why haven't you? 	shall i conclude that the point has been received and the 	opposition has forfeited the field? with all due respect, you can conclude anything you want. i just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the united states or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions. for that matter, i confess i'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since i thought you told us earlier that every court in the us has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing. do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo? not only that, but why do you even =care= what the us courts say anyway? didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by us officials to classify you as a "14th amendment federal citizen"? when the fbi comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to washington, d.c., where they belong? or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. if you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, ok?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but without prejudice ucc 1-207). sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and i'm sick and tired of all this garbage. if i know what's good for me, i'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head. needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about us tax law. i, on the other hand, am a "14th amend- ment federal citizen", with a us passport to prove it, and plan to keep on filing form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though i will probably not owe any us income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign tax credit). -- rich wales <richw@mks.com> // mortice kern systems inc.

(though woody always dressed that way.) did we really expect gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ? 	what we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing d-fens is the same game as bashing that poor african american slug that clint eastwood used to blow away all the time. as that arch-wasp (male gender) george c. scott declaimed, "americans traditionally love to win. they love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser." and so on. 	the political implications are simple. if, as many socialists - and democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some "equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. that could be black women today, asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority. 	or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. in some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). in the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a "neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit the pot. 	either way you go, the way of the winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from high school (but you'll still be popular at high school reunions). but it beats being a nerd, as i would imagine michael douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (even in hollywood, which treats losers worse than any other place in america except for new york and washington, d.c. - and even in columbus, ohio, which produced alex keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) i'd like to see more winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !! (we should definitely let the buckeyes win the rose bowl someday) bill r. -- "the only proposals in the senate that i "my opinions do not represent have seen fit to mention are particularly those of my employer or praiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones. any government agency." it seems to me that the historian's foremost - bill riggs duty is to ensure that virtue is remembered, and to deter evil words and deeds with the fear of posterity's damnation." - tacitus, _annals_ iii. 65

well, the message was interesting (and long), but twice? oh well. personally, i loathe libertarianism, but my disagreement is philisophical, not tactical. election law reform is a good idea. you would not believe what kind of stunts the creatures of the 2 party system are capable of pulling. ============================================================================ david matthew deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu) when the words fold open, it means the death of doors; even casement windows sense the danger.

government-mandated energy conservation is unnecessary and wastful, study finds washington, dc -- the energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency measures supported by president clinton and energy secretary hazel o'leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the cato institute points out. according to jerry taylor, cato's director of natural resource studies, we are not running out of sources of energy. the world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of 1970. proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically. when standards of living, population densities, and industrial structures are controlled for, the united states is no less energy efficient than japan and more energy efficient than many of the group of seven nations. energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global. moreover, since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product, even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall u.s. economy. market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per $1,000 of gnp than are centrally planned economies. utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource inputs, an competitive inequities. furthermore, dsm programs do not reduce demand. taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance, gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state at the expense of the individual.

secret purpose of falklands war; [with in-visibility technology] dr. beter audio letter #74 of 80 digitized by jon volkoff, mail address eidetics@cerf.net "audio letter(r)" is a registered trademark

----------------------------------------------------------------- this is the dr. beter audio letter(r), 1629 k st. nw, washington, dc 20006. hello, my friends, this is dr. beter. today is april 30, 1982, and this is my audio letter(r) no. 74. it's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic. on the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren, wind-swept falkland islands and south georgia island. in reality, it's far more than that. the so-called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation. during this month of april 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific. up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides. but as i say these words, the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface. beginning today, april 30, a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun. at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area. to be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the royal navy does not have that much time. winter is coming on in the south atlantic, and the british supply lines are overextended. having come this far, her majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina. as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be. there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat. that reason, my friends, is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month. up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet. only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses. to obtain that cover story, the british have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained. in short, my friends, her majesty's navy has sailed into a trap. the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past. for weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an "armada" (quote). the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description. the original spanish armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada. the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of england's queen elizabeth i. the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england. they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake. drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle. the english fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach. from there the english pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada. when it was all over, barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port. drake's defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world. it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire. today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle. queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i, and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation. once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is british, not spanish. four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene. the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america. the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy. my three special topics for this audio letter are: topic #1--the military secret of south georgia island topic #2--the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic #3--the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war. topic #1--when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot. for a century and a half since 1833, the islands have been controlled by great britain. during that entire time, british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina. there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands, which it calls the malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them. the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states, and they are not much of a prize. after 150 years of occupancy, the falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 british settlers and a lot of sheep. in short, the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place. we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina. the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's doorstep. instead, britain is throwing almost everything it's got at argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it. luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed. ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force. the initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70. over two-thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina. watching all this, a lot of people are asking: what's this fight really all about? the most popular answer suggested in the major media is "oil." vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years. in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island. south georgia island is 800 miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to south georgia, the falklands are an island paradise. south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow. most of it is uninhabitable. on top of all that, argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island. in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands. in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists. in 1833 the british expelled them and took over the island. for that and other historical reasons, argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina, not britain. but no such argument is possible for south georgia island. it has always been controlled by britain, never by argentina or spain. the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view. argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms. they were well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long. by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the island was retaken by britain. so the question is: why did argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all? my friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic. south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret. it's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island. the real reason for the so-called falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly. the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new. what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington. for the past two months i've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them. the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year 1982!! it is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called falklands crisis to erupt now. what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war. the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here--namely, the rockefeller cartel--and russia's new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis. they are trying to ruin phase #3 of the "project z" war plan which i revealed last month. that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one. as i mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world. the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war. having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in government war bunkers! when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries. they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open. they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months. the rockefeller cartel and russia's new anti-bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan. last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago. it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks. since that time the united states government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions. but before that, the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers. in 1961 the brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination. it was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which i first described long ago in audio letter no. 28. it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually. without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple. by deliberately appearing weak, the rockefeller-controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia. then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world. when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s. their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres. both superpowers, the united states and the soviet union, are located well up in the northern hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--great britain, france, red china, and india. by contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between. in other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war. in an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war. but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread. it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres. in the northern half of our planet, cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air. a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places. the military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers. a quick look at the globe of the world shows why. the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii. as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter, nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war. he accomplished this as so-called "coordinator of hemispheric defense" for then-president franklin d. roosevelt. so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources. then there is the african continent. there, too, rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa, especially south of the equator. all this was thanks to the efforts of john d. rockefeller iii, as i detailed in audio letter no. 36. looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand. thanks to world war ii, both were wide open to the rockefellers. the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war. by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war. then, as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces. in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth. in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass. for example, revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon. the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy. a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the south atlantic, the other in the south pacific. since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards. new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden. to hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space. on top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation. finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out. the combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself. during a so-called banking trip to sweden, david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port. the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water. the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors. inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships. the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted. a survey of candidate sites was then initiated. the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere. many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator. still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible. finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically. at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected. in the south pacific, extreme southern new zealand was selected. this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no. 71 three months ago when i called attention to new zealand's extreme importance in the coming war. in order to obtain the necessary space, the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together. one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water's edge. the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island, which is off the tip of south island. the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt. anglem. the new zealand location met all the requirements. ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain. the location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack. they are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific. in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found. that site, my friends, is south georgia island. it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic. the tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. it is controlled by great britain whose government, like that of new zealand, was willing to cooperate; and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast. the whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but britain took no chances. in 1965 the whaling station was closed down. since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists. construction of the secret naval facilities--two in new zealand, one on south georgia island--began in the early 1960's. the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain, colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. in this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction. the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged. like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up. when sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention. the man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea. once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage. the fake disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task. from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme. he was then-secretary of defense robert mcnamara. all through the 60's mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america's visible military power. this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards. what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards. where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island! the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states. as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time. that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first. this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques. the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines. they are all nuclear powered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them. a secret twin was built for the u.s.s. nimitz, for the u.s.s. eisenhower, and for the newly-launched u.s.s. carl vincent. all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the defense department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way! the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels. even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference. last month i revealed that the so-called "stealth program" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield. this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity. a whole new fleet of phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth-field equipment! the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field. after nuclear war one, the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth. it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination. the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the united states military. now it's the american bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war. these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the "falklands crisis." topic #2--in audio letter(r) no. 73 last month i described "project z", the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear war one. an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in washington. it's a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with russia. having set off the holocaust, the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers. finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies. activating phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets. with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world. the united states as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory. up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track. they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982! time is fast running out. the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race. they have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks. one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-bolshevik ruling clique in russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways. in audio letter no. 71 three months ago i reported that a limited, new anti-bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians. the january 26 meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva, switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition. it is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called "falkland crisis" now dominating the headlines. it should be emphasized that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance. they have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the bolsheviks here in america. the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. if they can do that, time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no. 67. a slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-bolshevik actions to be implemented. the joint rockefeller-russian planners decided by mid-february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly. no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer. the exact details of the "project z" war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or the russians, but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month. it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase #3 of the bolshevik war plan--that is, the bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled. by working together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. the rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them. the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack. it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked. survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable. military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question. there was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world. any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent. but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter. in a way, the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles' heel. the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible. the key lay with argentina and her long-standing claims to the falkland islands. as i mentioned in topic #1, the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades. cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there. the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the south georgia base to be attacked. the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do. as an inducement to cooperate, the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards. they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands. this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy. and to bolster the troubled argentine economy, it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves. with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the argentine military junta agreed to the plan. on march 19 argentina carried out act #1 in the joint attack plan. a group of argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island. supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell. while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work-site. the british, always nervous about south georgia island, promptly reacted as expected. the british antarctic survey ship "endurance" put 22 marines ashore. they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag. the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old falklands dispute to a boil. from time to time in the past, argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain. that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy. it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot. during late march, argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands. "nothing new", thought the british high command. argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times. it was believed that they were about to do it again; but on april 2 argentine forces did the unexpected. after many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the islands. all argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small argentine force also seized far-off south georgia island. the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists. that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller-russian attack plan. thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the island undetected. based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base. special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense. by late that evening, april 3, the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place. the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible. the joint rockefeller-russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside. it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base. once the hole was made, the next step was obvious. the rockefeller-russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole. the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas. the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april 3 can hardly be described, my friends. the thatcher government, like the so-called reagan administration here in america, is bolshevik controlled. that's why margaret thatcher always says, "me, too" any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia. both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of april 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble. immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic. haste was the order of the day. the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock. the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about april 24. if help did not reach south georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed. the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances. their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle. they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons. to open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide. on april 5, just two days after south georgia island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of british ports. the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister. he was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations. that same day, april 5, new zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with argentina. the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on "red alert." as a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea. several surface ships were already at sea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier. on that busy day of april 5, argentina's foreign minister, costa mendez, was at the united nations in new york. he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy. costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials. he got them! for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on. that, my friends, was only a cover story. the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island. if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely. the official stories about "slow movement" of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle. if need be, the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island, then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule. in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved. it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks. that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed. but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan. key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14, two days before it was announced officially. shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble. russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island. the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation. in moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced. then a russian "sub" closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes. it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly. so far as is known, there were no survivors. this unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produced two results, both important: first, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada. the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time. public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown. the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer. all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island. the drilling continued. the other result of the sinking was equally important. word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action. it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic, which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble. during the dead of night, early april 15, the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand. they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands, 450 miles southeast of new zealand. their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack. these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as i explained last month; but once they arrived at the antipodes, the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters. the antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america. the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller-russian planners had hoped for. the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand! the british ship's sinking of april 14 was also followed by other events. on april 15 the argentine navy started moving out of port. the same day, alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires. supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a general, dealing with generals. haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel, as i have revealed in the past. he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment. four days later, april 19, haig left for washington. as he boarded his plane, haig somberly told reporters, "time is running out." and so it was, my friends, for the secret south georgia base. the very next day, april 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base. bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend. the british fleet was still out of range. the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact russian neutron bomb. when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating. the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base. also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them. meanwhile, russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders. from a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed. floating overhead, the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment known as prf. as i have reported in the past, there is no method known by which prf can be jammed. the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines. the "subs" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact. more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world. the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time. the time here in washington was around 2:00 p.m. april 23. that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister, francis pym. pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public. but not haig. haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder. the joint rockefeller-russian military operation had been a brilliant success. the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside south georgia island; and the south pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled. by working together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere. topic #3--as i say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic, but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over. what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath. that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands. they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war. at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain. as soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the falklands. britain has no choice but to fight. she has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy. meanwhile, the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign. on all sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze movement." there are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war. in recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue. medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war. we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously. we are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time. if you believe that, my friends, i give up. movements like this never, and i mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it. what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work. as i've explained in the past, the rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place. if it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it. instead, the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel, the bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war. the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia; but as russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group. it's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers. the russians regard the united states as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers. their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day. the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda. that objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government. the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign. under bolshevik control, the so-called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power. these days the smell of war is in the air. the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense. the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war. a new super-united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill. it will have teeth! as presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in geneva, switzerland. the working name, though this may be changed, is the "world nonproliferation council." the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all. last minute summary now it's time for my last minute summary. in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so-called falkland islands crisis. the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere. these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable. the attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen. one result, though, is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap. britain's waterloo at sea may well be at hand. my friends, two factions are struggling for control over our united states--the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks. they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear. if we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ, our only hope. as the scripture tells us, our lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind." we must learn to wage peace. as our lord declared long ago, "blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of god." until next month, god willing, this is dr. beter. thank you, and may god bless each and every one of you.

the white house office of the press secretary (vancouver, british columbia) _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 4, 1993 	 press conference by the president with russian press 	 canada place vancouver, british columbia 2:46 p.m. pdt 	 	 	 q	 i had two questions for both presidents, so you could probably answer for boris, too. (laughter.) 	 	 the president: i'll give you my answer, then i'll give you yeltsin's answer. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 the first is that this is the meeting of the presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government. but you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses. so the question is how the russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever? what are the priorities, because there are several association of russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment? 	 	 this is the first. and second, to you. we know that polls, public polls in america do not show that americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid. like newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and new york times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports yeltsin. how are you going to sort of handle this problem that americans themselves are not very enthusiastic? thank you. 	 	 q	 i have a question, i'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into russian? no, just the answers. just the answers. okay. 	 	 the president: the answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing. for example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application. the privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises. then there are some other general funds in the democracy corps and other things which people in russia will have some influence over the distribution of. 	 	 with regard to your second question, let me say that i would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the american government giving money to the russian government. there's opposition to that in russia. and in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds. that is, this has nothing to do with russia. if you look at the whole history of america, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular. 	 	 what i have tried to tell the american people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future. we spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the cold war. now, with a democratic government in russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the russian side. 	 	 so i don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the united states. this is very much in the interest of the united states. the things i announced today, the second stage of the program, which i hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country. 	 	 russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals. but it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue. that's not what it is, it's an investment for america and it's a wonderful investment. 	 	 like all investments, there is some risk. but there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the cold war. 	 	 q	 mr. president, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us. in the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an american president is doing this to the russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough. 	 	 i have two questions. one, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the start ii and start i issues. could you tell us: did you reach an agreement with president yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have ukraine join the ratification of start i and the npt regime? and my second question is, how confident you are that the united states congress would be eager to support you in lifting jackson-vanik and other restrictions inherited from the cold war? 	 	 president clinton: first, we discussed the issue of ukraine with regard to start i and npt, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the united states develop strong relationships with them. we know that one thing that we could do that would increase, i think, the willingness of the ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for russia, but also for ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part. but we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the lisbon protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that. 	 	 i, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure ukraine's leaders, specifically the president and the foreign minister, that i want strong ties with ukraine, that the united states very much wants a good relationship with ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of ukraine and to have the united states be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify start i and to join the npt regime is critical. 	 	 what was the second question? 	 	 the president: with regard to jackson-vanik and cocom, i would make two points: first, i have agreed with the republican and democratic leaders in the congress that we will, as soon as i return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the united states and russia, that are legacies of the cold war. and we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the congress. 	 	 with regard to jackson-vanik, i think there will be an openness to change the law if the congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to. if the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then i think that the desire to keep the law will be much less. 	 	 with regard to cocom, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the cocom regime. but i think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future. 	 	 q	 mr. clinton, when i read your speech in annapolis, i got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and i stress that -- personal, not political approach towards russia, compared to the approach of mr. bush. could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to russia and the approach of mr. bush? and who made you -- why did you cite akhmatova in the last part of your speech? 	 	 the president: let me say, first, i do not wish to compare myself with president bush or anyone else. i can't say what was in his heart about russia. i can say that since i was a boy, i have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of russia. i have been thrilled by russian music since i was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now. i have read major russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as i could about your history. 	 	 and i went to the soviet union -- but it was then the soviet union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that i spent the first week of 1970 alone in moscow and did not return again until three days before mr. yeltsin was elected president. but all that time i was away, i was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners. so i have always had a personal feeling about russia. 	 	 i remember, for example -- a lot of you know i like music very much. one of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when leonard bernstein took the new york philharmonic to moscow and played shostakovich's fifth symphony to the russians. and he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult. that is something i followed very closely when it occurred. 	 	 these are things that have always had a big impact on my life. and i had just always hoped that someday, if i ever had the chance to, i could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners. (applause.) 	 	 the press: thank you. end3:06 p.m. pdt

the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 5, 1993 press briefing by george stephanopolous the briefing room 10:10 a.m. edt 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as you know, the president is soon to be on his way, on amtrack to camden yards. he'll be throwing out the first pitch. 	 	 q	 it's marc, the maryland area transit, it's not amtrack. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, it's not amtrack? well, he's going from union station, you're right. excuse me. 	 	 q	 george, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with ??? senate? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, there are discussions between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning, and i think that the president is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible. we need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer. and the president continues to believe his program should be passed. 	 	 q	 will he compromise, that's the question? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and senator dole, let's see what they come up with. but the president believes his jobs program should go forward. 	 	 q	 george, would the president be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i don't know what is being offered by either side. the senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today. 	 	 q	 would he go that far -- no matter what the republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president believes that his program should be passed at this time. clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the senators might or might not be able to come up with, but i'm not going to get into figures right now. let's see what happens. 	 	 q	 it's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the president's jobs bill, than in doing something to create -- mr. stephanopoulos: well, the republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the president's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the american people. i think there's no question about that. there's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days. 	 	 q	 so, you'll need to compromise to get your package through? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we'll see what happens with the conversations between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning. 	 	 q	 prepared to compromise -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president's prepared to listen to what senator mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with senator dole. 	 	 q	 does he feel that he has been defeated in his -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not in the least. in fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term. 	 	 q	 how? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years. and it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future. right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the house. simply because a minority of republicans in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the president's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall. 	 	 q	 he can't beat this, can he? 	 	 q	 the fact is they can do that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the republicans can stop action. there's no question about that. 	 	 q	 what are you going to do about it? 	 	 q	 george, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by boris yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the president told boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese; that when they say yes they mean no? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting. the context of the conversation was that president clinton was actually reassuring president yeltsin at the time about his conversations with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril islands and the prime minister's belief that japan would play a constructive role in the g-7 process. i mean this was a casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring president yeltsin that he believed the japanese were serious about their commitment to the g-7 process. 	 	 q	 are you saying that the president said that when the japanese say yes they mean no? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's not -- i don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue prime minister miyazawa intends to really go forward with the g-7 process. 	 	 q	 have there been any attempts to explain this to the japanese because apparently the japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i've seen the reports in the japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context. it does talk about the japanese -- understanding the japanese points of view. i don't think it's going to be a problem. i believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but i'm not positive. 	 	 q	 george, was the specific comment that was made specific to the kuril island situation or was it a general observation on japanese etiquette? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the discussion was about -- 	 	 q	 the specific comment is what i'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the russian notes, "when the japanese say yes they mean no." 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, it was a combination. i mean i don't think that's the whole sentence. i think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that prime minister miyazawa means to keep the commitment. 	 	 q	 was he saying it facetiously first? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it was just a casual observation. 	 	 q	 and then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up. has the president sent a message? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, i don't think the president spoke; i believe that secretary christopher has made some calls but i'm not sure exactly how many. 	 	 q	 well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if christopher has had to make some calls. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, no. it was just that we got the reports in vancouver and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 	 mr. stephanopoulos: -- reports in vancouver, and the secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and i don't believe there is on. 	 	 q	 what is our position about the japanese? that they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. the position on the japanese is as the president stated to president yeltsin throughout the two days. he said that he had had a good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit. he reiterated the u.s. position, the long-standing support for the japanese position on the kuril islands, but also reiterated prime minister miazawa's commitment to move forward on the g-7 process and to play a constructive role. and i think president yeltsin was very glad to hear that. 	 	 q	 after listening to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few days, i'm a little confused. what is the u.s. policy? do you want to see saddam hussein overturned? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's the same policy that secretary christopher has reiterated, and all of the u.s officials have reiterated. we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all u.n. resolutions. right now we do not have that compliance. 	 	 q	 throwing it out further that if iraq complies, saddam can't stay in office? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: right. i think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power. but the important point is that we expect compliance by iraq with all u.n. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it. 	 	 q	 and are you concerned the iran will become the dominant power in the area -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: secretary christopher has also spoken to iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism. 	 	 q	 that's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with u.n. resolutions. on what logic do you base that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: right now saddam hussein is not complying with the u.n. resolutions at all. he is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the u.n. resolution. he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections. he is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments. 	 	 q	 well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power? 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people. if he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power. 	 	 q	 george, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the president accuse the republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock? why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the fact that several times in the past the republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding. 	 	 q	 george, in regards to that, some of the moderate republicans said that the white house erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the white house and the senate republicans, and that was it. does the administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - - 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting. i mean, the president met with the republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package. he met with the entire senate republican caucus also for lunch, and went up there. we are continually in contact with as many republicans as we can find who have an interest in the president's package. we are interested in what they have to say, as well. but we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it. 	 	 q	 your all or nothing, do it with the democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i mean, i think that there is no question that under the senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity. i mean, there is just no question about that. you only need 40 plus one to keep going. 40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the republicans are doing. 	 	 q	 going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer? 	 	 q	 work with republicans and try to woo some republicans into your camp? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think we're going to continue to look for the support of republicans whenever we can get it on the president's intiatives? 	 	 q	 but on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need republican votes? are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes? when you have to go through -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road. clearly the president's going to continue to reach out when he can. 	 	 q	 you don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the republicans in congress based on this experience? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: obviously the president would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that. we will continue to reach out to republicans, there's not question about that. and we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation. in this case the republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward. 	 	 q	 they're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think they're being -- 	 	 q	 any ideas. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think their amendments are being defeated; i don't know that they're being denied. 	 	 q	 to present them. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's not exactly true. i mean they get the votes -- 	 	 q	 that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true. 	 	 q	 george, one more on iraq. is the administration backing any of the iraqi opposition? grooming any new leadership? 	 	 q	 backing any of the iraqi -- leadership? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, i -- again, we're pressing for iraqi compliance. i don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership. i believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with iraqi opposition groups. i don't know about anything recently. 	 	 q	 jesse jackson, who, of course, is not the president's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the president, pre-empted the ball game -- los angeles. will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, as you know, the president appointed commerce secretary ron brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to california, and coordiante cabinet activities around the california economic situation, including the situation in los angeles. 	 	 i believe there will also be visits out to los angeles by the education -- or have been visits by the education secretary, mr. riley. i believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisneros are also going out. and there may be other visits by cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks. i wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by president clinton to california. obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances. but we're going to continue to watch it. 	 	 q	 george, as a follow-up, reverend jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management. does the president have a position on that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president has received correspondence from reverend jackson. i know that reverend jackson has also spoken with the white house chief of staff, mack mclarty. he clearly raises serious questions. there has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough. but the president intends to continue to go to the ball game. 	 	 q	 is he going to say anything about it today, or see reverend jackson while he's out there? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if he is going to see them, but as i said, the president believes that reverend jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as i said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough. 	 	 q	 did reverend jackson ask him not to go to the ball game? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure about that. i believe the characterization the reverend jackson is talking about is an informational pickett. i don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it. 	 	 q	 george, the orioles are playing the rangers, the managing partner of the rangers is george w. bush. is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the president? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. 	 	 q	 what is the mubarak schedule? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i know that president mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and i believe that he is having dinner tonight with vice president gore. 	 	 q	 and joint statements tomorrow -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe so, yes. at the end, yes. 	 	 q	 is there evidence, george, that the egyptians did warn the u.s. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as reported in the new york times, i mean, i think that president mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time. we do have general intelligence sharing, i mean. but president mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward. the president will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind. 	 	 q	 george, he did make specific -- or the egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't know if i would agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview. he did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the united states and upon which we took appropriate action. but there was no specific information on this specific operation at all. 	 	 q	 so, the white house doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the cia or fbi who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, not at all. 	 	 q	 what's next with serbia? it got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: you didn't get to ask your question. 	 	 q	 yes, exactly. was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries? and even if there wasn't, what does the u.s. do next? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think the u.s. is clearly going to move forward in the u.n. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement. 	 	 q	 george, why do you think sanctions is still an option? i mean the serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon. the bosnian serbs have said no to the peace plan. when does no mean no and you have to do something different? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i mean we are doing something different. we're moving forward on further sanctions through the u.n. and those discussions will continue. we're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbia, and i think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time. 	 	 q	 are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? mr. stephanopoulos: the president has said that this is something that is under consideration. 	 	 q	 george, do you have any more on hugh rodham's condition, how he's doing? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as far as i know nothing's changed. 	 	 q	 george, -- week after mr. mubarak? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's a little unclear. i think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit. 	 	 q	 is he going somewhere for easter? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not that i know of. 	 	 q	 what more can you tell us about the additional aid to russia that the president plans to ask congress about?

the white house office of the press secretary ____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 5, 1993 remarks by the president en route to camden yards for orioles opening day game 	 marc train en route to camden yards 11:45 a.m. edt 	 	 q	 mr. president, what do you think of jesse jackson's protest today? 	 	 the president: i think it's an informational protest. i think it's fine. the owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management. i think we should. i'm encouraged by don baylor's appointment out in colorado. and i think it's time to make a move on that front. so, i think it's a legitimate issue, and i think it's -- like i said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game. so, i think it's good. 	 	 q	 do you think they're moving fast enough? 	 	 the president: well, i think that it was a good first step. and i think you'll see some movement now. and i think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some. and i think that reverend jackson being out there will highlight the issue. so i think it's fine. 	 	 q	 mr. president, how about the logjam in the senate on the economic stimulus plan? do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture? 	 	 the president: i don't know, we're working at it. i mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers i saw, which pretty well summed it up. they said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play. in the senate the majority does not rule. it's not like the country. it's not like the -- it's not like the house. if the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule. and that's what they're doing. there are a lot of republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it. 	 	 and, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like baltimore and dallas and houston and pittsburgh and philadelphia and portland and seattle. it's very sad. i mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the republicans had always championed. just about the only democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators. i just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep americans out of work. i think it's a mistake. 	 	 the press: thank you. end11:50 a.m. edt

the white house office of the press secretary (vancouver, british columbia) ______________________________________________________________ background briefing by senior administration officials april 4, 1993 	 canada place vancouver, british columbia 9:40 a.m. pst 	 	 	 folks, we're about to start the background briefing on the aid package. 	 senior administration official: good morning. the president -- president clinton and president yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of american initiatives to support economic and political reform in russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion. 	 before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, i want to make a few points. first, this is the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available funds to support russian reform. all of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress. there is no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund any of these programs. all our fiscal year '93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow. 	 	 the second point is that this package is designed to support russian reformers. all of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the russian government. 	 	 third, the president is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year. the package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform. in designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you. 	 	 fourth, i'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment. i think it's fair to say that russia's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. no collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so. and so the president and president yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship. 	 	 they also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the u.s. side by vice president gore; on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin. and the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship. 	 	 if it would be helpful i'd be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of u.s. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are. i'll do it quickly and then i'll be glad to take questions. 	 	 the first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance. this is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities. that's $194 million in grant -- that is from food for progress, the grant portion of food for progress. we'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million. 	 	 the second item is concessional food sales. as you know, the united states has had a long-term grain relationship with russia. it's important to us and it's important to russia that we continue that relationship. the president has chosen the food for progress program which is a concessional loan program. the value over the next seven months is $700 million. these are concessional terms. the exact terms have not been worked out, but i think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal. 	 	 the third program is a collection of private sector support. we think this is one of the most important things we're going to do. privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in moscow. and so the president has decided to create a russian-american enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million. and the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in russia, to take equity positions in those businesses. 	 	 the president has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis. he has also agreed -- the president has also agreed to establish a eurasia foundation. this would be a private foundation led by prominent americans to fund democratization projects in russia. 	 	 the fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself. i think it's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in russia. you see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs. the detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're launching. 	 	 the president is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the united states to support reform in russia. 	 	 the fifth program you see is russian office of resettlement. this is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration. this is a demonstration project. what we'd like to do is work with the russian military to help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic states and other parts of the former soviet union. we want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's with russian labor and russian materials or using prefab american construction. and so we've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units. we'll be working very closely with the russian military on this. and i would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project. 	 	 the sixth area is energy in the environment. they are two issues that the president feels strongly about. our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage. 	 	 i've talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the vice president will chair on our side. secretary ron brown will also be cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment. we are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this problem full-time. 	 	 and the point i'd like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s. and we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important. 	 	 you'll notice that the united states is going to support russia's membership in the gatt. russia has had observer status. russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the gatt. we think that the long-term goal of drawing russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal. and that is why we are supporting the membership in the gatt. we are also supporting their access to gsp, the generalized system of preferences. 	 	 you'll note that ex-im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in siberia, that opic has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a conoco oil project. i'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between russia and the united states for a $2-billion framework facility through the ex-im bank that would finance russian purchases of american oil and gas equipment and services. we think this is a very important development. we think we'll get there by april 14th, which is the opening day of the tokyo conference, the g-7 conference. 	 	 before i take any further questions, i'd like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you. 	 	 senior administration official: our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts in ukraine, kazakhstan and belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the start i and start ii agreements. recently we completed in moscow three, i think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of nunn-lugar funding to three important programs. the first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program. that is for submarines, for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million. 	 	 the second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled. this will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility. 	 	 and finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system. so we add that $215-million total to the extant nunn-lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the russians over the last couple of years. 	 	 so this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians, kazhaks, and belarussians. belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in fy'93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on belarussian territory. and this was in the wake of their ratification of start i, an agreement to accede to npt. 	 	 so we are working very hard with all the parties to the lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them. and i look upon these three recent agreements with russia as a very important step in that process. 	 	 q	 the opic funds to -- is that for the field in kazhakstan -- and conoco already signed this deal with kazhakstan. why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the same one, why do you feel it's necessary? 	 	 senior administration official: it's not the same deal. chevron signed a deal with kazhakstan, the tenges oil field. this is a new investment project. it's a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced today. so it's completely new. 	 	 q	 can you tell us more about what's involved? 	 	 senior administration official: yes. conoco, like other american oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things. one, to prospect for new oil in siberia, west siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in russia. the objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what russia needs. 	 	 so we think this deal is very, very good development for russia. the russians do as well, and it's good for an american company. and the american government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee. 	 	 q	 so it's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there? 	 	 senior administration official: that's right. 	 	 q	 on that point, should other american companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the ex-im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion? 	 	 senior administration official: well, as you know, ex-im is part of the u.s. government and various parts of the u.s. government have been pushing, including the state department and the white house for this deal to be consummated. and we think it will. and if we arrive at this agreement by april 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for american companies to sell their equipment and sell their services. 	 	 q	 that should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be support for opic sort of deals such as this conoco? 	 	 senior administration official: there's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas companies to invest in russia. we think that the ex-im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest. but i think the interest may even extend beyond that. and if so, the government will respond. 	 	 q	 what's the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward? and is there any current year budget costs -- 	 	 senior administration official: i'll have to refer you to ex-im for that. i don't know the details of that. 	 	 q	 the concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due? 	 	 senior administration official: the concessional food sales are from food for progress, which is a usda program. usda has the funds, we don't need to go back to the congress to expend those funds. there will be a hit in the budget. i'd refer you to usda and omb for the details on that. 	 	 q	 can you talk about the democracy corps? 	 	 q	 and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that? 	 	 senior administration official: why don't i start with the democracy corps first. i think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the united states that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis. and there were literally 10 or 15 u.s. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area. and so the administration felt -- the president felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts. and so this is a presidential initiative. 	 	 it will be headed by ambassador tom simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for u.s. assistance in the former soviet union. and we're very hopeful that we might use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the american private sector and schools and communities across the nation. 	 	 q	 any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on fy'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the president talked about? 	 	 senior administration official: the administration is requesting additional funds in fy'94 of $700 million. what the president has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measures the united states could take in some of these areas to support reform. he'll be consulting with the congress. when he returns to washington, he'll be consulting also with the other ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time. 	 	 q	 two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money. first of all, i thought it was the sort of consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food. so why did you decide to do it that way? secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of russia's inability to pay. how does this fit into that situation? 	 	 senior administration official: as you know, the united states for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to russia. i think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the commodity credit corporation. that was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of american grain products. on december 1 of last year, '92, the russian government stopped its payments on that program. they are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the united states cannot continue that program. and so the president, working with secretary espy and other officials in the cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote american grain sales. 	 	 and i think we have two ways to do that. we've announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program. but we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program. 	 	 i think everybody agrees that russia -- that a short-term loan program for russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would. and that is what this program is. it will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal. and then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent. and so we believe and the russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and it's important for the american farm community. 	 	 q	 i gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the russians' failure to pay the interest on ecc loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right? 	 	 senior administration official: let me be explicit about that. we are prevented under the law to from continuing the commodity credit corporation short-term credit program because of russia's arrearages to the united states. all of you know about those arrearages. they total about, i think, around $640 million. usda can give you an exact figure. so having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve american market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, we looked at food for progress, which is a program we've used to great effect in other parts of the world. and we consulted with the russian government and arrived at this solution. 	 	 i think the russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments. 	 	 q	 where do those funds actually come from? 	 	 senior administration official: they come from the food for progress program, which is a program under usda's authority. usda has the authority to spend these funds. we do not need to go back to the congress for these funds. and i want to make that general point again: everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the congress. the administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow. and it's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments. and we are confident we'll be able to do so. 	 	 q	 how did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to -- 	 	 senior administration official: there's a reason for it. the reason was that the russian government told us that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time. and so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time russia won't require the same level of food imports from the west. 	 	 q	 i would imagine there's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with russia. have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the ukraine, with georgia , with some of the other republics? 	 	 senior administration official: yes, we're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending american support to the 11 other countries of the former soviet union. we have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries. 	 	 in the area of food sales, we have been active with ukraine, in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia. we will continue that. and i think it's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they're hard-hitting. 	 	 q	 has anything happened at the summit to lead american energy companies and other companies to believe that russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy? 	 	 senior administration official: well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight, not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment. and i'd like to refer to the point i made at the beginning. we're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that. 	 	 we look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector. it is a very good match with what the russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production. 	 	 that's what the russian government has told us it wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis on it. that's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton. and we're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the american business community that we support their efforts to invest in russia, that the united states, through ex- im and opec and the department of commerce, will be there to support them. 	 	 q	 my question is, is yeltsin in any position to deliver on making russia a more -- 	 	 senior administration official: we think he is. i would note that president yeltsin's prime minister, mr. chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the russian oil and gas sector. he will now chair a high-level commission with the vice president, vice president gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas sector. we believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee. and we're looking forward to the work. 	 	 q	 what type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program? and will the u.s. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the russian government for distribution at their will? 	 	 	 senior administration official: are you talking about the variety of programs listed here? it depends on the program itself. in most cases, though, we are either working through american pbos or american government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source. that's an obligation we have to the congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money. we have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs. 	 	 but they are all quite different. for instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery of the food. for grant medical assistance, we've been working through project hope which is a private organization. for the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of russian officers, we'll be working with a group of american pbos. on some of the democratization projects, we're working directly with russian private individuals and private foundations. we're working with journalists in russia on a media project that you may have noticed. 	 	 so we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways. some directly with the russian government, some with russian citizens. 	 	 q	 the jackson-vanik restrictions that remain and on the cocom restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the president has to do on that? 	 	 senior administration official: well, as george noted yesterday, president yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship. the president has noted that. i think it's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look at both of these questions, and we'll get back to the russian government. 	 	 q	 you were not prepared for these questions when you got here? 	 	 senior administration official: we were prepared for these questions. we've looked at them. but we're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend. they require -- let me just explain, particularly on jackson-vanik. they require consultation with the congress. they require consultation with the american jewish community. and we're very sensitive to those concerns. and so we'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action. 	 	 q	 is this package designed so that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this point? 	 	 senior administration official: as i said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the congress. so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts. in effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and i know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow. and that's the advantage of this particular initiative. 	 	 q	 if this, as the president says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of congress are at this moment heading for moscow, why aren't you talking about going to congress and suggesting to the president of russia that you are prepared to go to congress for various things? 	 	 senior administration official: i think we've been clear about that. the president is discussing this weekend with president yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for american funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has. we have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by representative gephardt and we'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of congress before doing anything. and we'll also want to consult with our allies. so that's where it stands now. 	 	 q	 we've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated. could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be? 	 	 senior administration official: i think that we've said that these are all projects that either congress had allocated money for through the freedom support act; there were some funds that were left over from fy'92. and this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended. 	 	 we didn't use just the freedom support act funds or the fy'92 funds. we went into some of the agency allocations -- ex-im, opic, and usda -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs. 	 	 and example of that is the food for progress concessional loans. we had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through usda. we could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it. 	 	 q	 where, for example, are you getting the money for this russian officer resettlement -- 	 	 senior administration official: that's from the freedom support act funds. 	 	 q	 in other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak -- 	 	 senior administration official: most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits. and if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all freedom support act funding. a little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92. the nunn-lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds. 	 	 q	 cooperation -- 	 	 senior administration official: from fy '92? i don't have the exact figure. it was not a considerable figure. 	 	 q	 could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start -- for start i and ii as a result of what's happened here -- 	 	 senior administration official: both presidents, president yeltsin and president clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning. in fact, we haven't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues. that will be this morning's session. i know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us. we've been talking to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them. up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation that's been going on essentially between moscow and kiev. and we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially. 	 	 but in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, i don't yet know. in a couple hours we'll know. 	 	 q?	 just a follow-up on the financing here. is any of this robbing peter to pay boris -- since it's all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been earmarked and put it into this fund? 	 	 senior administration official: there are smoke and mirrors here, and i think it's an important point to note. we could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding. we're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort. and we've already talked to the russians about our long-term commitment. 	 	 we could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point: this package is fy '93. it's funds that we have. and we're going to do what we say we're going to do. and the president feels very strongly about that. in the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not able to meet them, we're determined, and the president is determined, to carry out every single program in this package. and we'll do it. 	 	 but we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's part of the discussions on economics this weekend. we're looking for russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform. and we've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year. 	 	 q	 taken it way from any -- 	 	 senior administration official: no, we haven't. okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in russia? the answer is no, we have not done so. 	 	 q	 in terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else. doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory? 	 	 senior administration official: not at all. i don't think it does. that's a particular example, and the example is grain sales. the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months. you all know about russia's debt problem, and russia was unable to meet those commitments. so we looked for a way to do two things: to meet russia's requirement for grain. they're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the american farmers have a chance to sell their products to russia. and we simply look for another way to finance that. and we have legislative authority to do it. this program has been successful in other areas. we had not tried it before in the former soviet union, but we thought we should now. 	 	 	 q	 isn't this really the bush-clinton aid package for russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by president bush? 	 	 senior administration official: no, i don't think that's a fair characterization. a lot of these funds were appropriated by the u.s. congress is 1991, in 1992. this administration took office and inherited some obligations that the bush administration had made. but we had a long six to seven week review of this program. we decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration. 	 	 but we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program. there was no number attached to it. in grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, i would say, is another clinton initiative. 	 	 further, we listened to the russian government and listened to the russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons. and president clinton has responded to that. and we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers. 	 	 i would also say that the president has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the russian experience. and in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the american government, to achieve that objective. 	 	 so i would not characterize it that way at all. and as most of you know, i am a career civil servant. i was in the last administration. i'm very familiar with what the last administration did. and i would characterize this as a clinton assistance package for russia. 	 	 q	 there's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people. is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it's being administered by the russian government? 	 	 senior administration official: i think that -- i know that the president and other senior officials of our government are concerned that american money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's intended. and so we're going to take great care -- aid and the state department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their source. 	 	 i would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the russian government. some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with russian private individuals, with businesses. the private enterprise support is another example of that. 	 	 senior administration official: if i could just add a word on this point with regard to the ssd-related programs, one area that we've been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs. they would be working very closely, of course, with the american firms, who would be the prime contractors. but this is a fine example, i think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended. 	 	 q	 when would the democracy corps start? exactly when do you see this happening? how would get it off the ground? 	 	 senior administration official: well, the president is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps. i think it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks. ambassador simons takes up his duties on may 1st. but in effect we've already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in russia. and we've said that we will be helpful. we've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government. we do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in russia in one way or another. we think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts. 	 	 q	 excuse me. how much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the united states by american made goods? 	 	 senior administration official: i don't have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that. 	 	 q	 this figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark? 	 	 senior administration official: no, i think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and i'm sorry to say that. no, this package -- president clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package. and he was briefed intensively on this. he contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package. he contributed a lot of the ideas in the package. and i think it's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago. we have been refining it ever since. we spent a couple of days last week going over it with the russian government, both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy. and so it's been evolving. but this particular package has been together for about two weeks. 	 	 q	 where is yeltsin's input into this then? there was so much talk before about the president wanted to get yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth. is that in the out years? 	 	 senior administration official: no, it's both. president yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them. 	 	 and so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package. we listened to him. on the privatization effort, we have been working with the russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details. so the russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way. 	 	 but let me get at the other part of your question. the president is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake. and we're looking for his ideas. the president has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing. but we're looking for russian ideas not. we need to consult with the congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active. 	 	 q	 there's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with? 	 	 senior administration official: this particular package, as i said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago. we have since then consulted with the russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've primarily talked about future, about what more the united states and other western countries can do to support reform in russia, which is our base objective here. 	 	 q	 i noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers. can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization? 	 	 senior administration official: you're right; we have a program to train russian -- young russians in banking and financial services in the united states. part of the housing initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain russian officers who are retiring into other professions. 	 	 q	 money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- 	 	 senior administration official: we have not yet allocated any money for that. 	 	 q	 why not? 	 	 q	 of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units. isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union? 	 	 senior administration official: if you want to do housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities. you've got to think about the purchase of land. you've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth. and it's also retraining. it's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- riga or tallin or vilnius in a house in western russia. we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well. this is responding to a request from the russian government. 	 	 q	 of the $6 million will go to retrain -- 	 	 senior administration official: that's right. 	 	 q	 are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- 	 	 senior administration official: we're talking about single, individual dwellings. 	 	 q	 you're saying that only 450 families will be served by this? 	 	 senior administration official: what i want to -- i thought i pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project. what we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the germans and the turks and the italians have had in building housing in western russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money. what we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with american organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done. 	 	 i noted that we have a long-term commitment to that. and so i would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future . but we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely. 	 	 q	 what is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect russia's reforms and that russia will be in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem? 	 	 senior administration official: well, look, i think it's important to note that the united states on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of russian reform. it's got to be a collective western effort, and we're looking to our allies to do more as well. but beyond that, it's really what the russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform. we can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests. 	 	 q	 did the president say that the value of the u.s. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the united states? so what is it about this program that does this? 	 	 senior administration official: i think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform. we are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the united states from reform in russia. so it's not a simple question. you can't just say that this program is the answer. it's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it. 	 	 q	 and then on the question of russia's ability to repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now? 	 	 senior administration official: well, the russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans. 	 	 q	 substantial government-to-government loan we've ever gotten into with the russians? 	 	 senior administration official: i don't want to answer authoritatively on that. i don't go back 20 or 30 years on this. but in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans. this is a different type of effort. 	 	 q	 government loans in any other sector that you recall? i know it wasn't done in -- 	 	 senior administration official: i think it's fair to say this is a new and unique effort. end10:25 a.m. pdt

from: baba@tymnet.com (duane hentrich) -btw, i'm a walc (white aryan lapsed catholic) - --- -d'baba duane m. hentrich baba@tymnet.com - i would like to go on record as objecting to mr. hentrich calling himself an aryan. the word `aryan' is of sanskrit origin and occurs first in the hindu scripture, the rigveda. it seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character. such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the eightfold aryan path. the word was borrowed by the german scholar max mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely. the people who originally called themselves aryas, the iranians, noprth indians, the afghans and possibly the kurds, are none of them nordic. so the use of the word by westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate. the only westerners who may have some claim to call themselves aryans (by descent) are the celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda. if you want to check what i am saying, look at mallory's book, ``in search of the indo-europeans" or, just look at the encyclopedia britannica. the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and for westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by germans to jews, using a word to which the germans have no clear claim. rohit parikh

you got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance. if you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. "it really doesn't matter to you..." if it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance? you're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words. > >> >> 2) if she is, then why does the mother have the right to kill > >> >> her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed > >> >> through the birth canal?

as others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival. again, your analogy fails. not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. a woman's womb is indisputably her own. also, i see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being. was that due to its inconvenience?

your argument is from fantasy island. your comparison is a total failure, as i have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically. and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous. as i said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure. on the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version. as i said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive. and, furthermore, as i have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal. you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb. when the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?

why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards? what is different about the two situations? i see i have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you. in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake. you can't have it both ways. action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway. ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was. to have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc. she behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive. dean kaflowitz

in case you missed it on the news....the first 16 haitians of many that tested positive for hiv and were being held on a base in cuba have been flown to the u.s. further a u.s. judge has ruled that they must receive medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could receive same. so guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab (just as you might have expected) for people who have never contributed a dime to the u.s. society. i think this government has its priorities all screwed up. if they want to help haitians....how about removing the illegal government, how about giving them development aid? it does not make sense to waste resources on dying non-citizens who will never be productive in either this country or their own. it does not make sense when the same resources applied or even just plain given to poor people in haiti could significantly help 100 people in haiti per 1 aids-infected non-citizen immigrant.

(i'm assuming > that, like all good people, you oppose the marital exemption for rape, > so i won't bring that up.) in order of your questions, i oppose it, i oppose it, i oppose it and (huh? wha? where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-) when i was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, i do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes i had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and i had to think out the question from scratch. what i finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying american concept of equal treatment under the law. last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. this was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their "contribution to society." i view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. accordingly, i believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the executive branch of the federal government. -- william december starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate board but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft of ideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities. but every culture has its upside and its downside. it seems to me that the white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if you're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig) it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the american indians civilization. nothing but selfish acts that benefit one group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as equal - ain't that some stuff) white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose. just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing god. no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a position. and then to manipulate and mislead all those people. hmmm... i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies. awww that's enough already from me because this has nothing to do with sex or this board. if ya'd like to continue this discussion e-mail me and we can compare and contrast ideas 			i like conflict - it's educational when the 			communcation is good...................... my $.02 worth (i apologize to those who thought this was going to be about sex but i was prompted by a response i found up here) dave lewis - frisky hands man

...his account that is. many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here on the net on a daily basis. i have just been informed of what i feel is one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- the out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people don't like what he says or thinks. we have all seen the postings here by aj teel. although many of us have not agreed with their content, i'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in them. i, for one, am greatful to live (i thought) in a country where people like mr. teel are allowed to say what they please. if i don't wan't to read it, i can just skip on by, or unsuscribe. but, unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live. they feel an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards. now it seems that mr. teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif net police, ted frank. please help aj teel regain net (post) access and correct this injustice. are you on ted's hit list? are your thoughts correct? is your account safe? has your sysadmin been contacted by the thought police? i thought the nlg and the aclu supported people with diverse opinions. not! please read the following forwarded messages from aj teel so that you may understand this vial act for what it is... ------------------------------ forwarded --------------------------------- newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal subject: officer ted frank, thought police badge number nwo-666 summary: ted wins the argument by killing his opponent! expires: sender: "a. j. teel, sui juris" (ajteel@dendrite.cs.colorado.edu) followup-to: alt.conspiracy distribution: organization: university of colorado, boulder keywords: nwo ted frank well, well, well... thanks to eck@panix.com (mark eckenwiler) and thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (ted frank), my account is to be axed. i guess that the information i am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. they (only ted and mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (in his defense, mark sent only one message and it was not that bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; however, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and i am very good at responding via netmail...) while i disagree with ted, i would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post i made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; simply ignoring me if i am such a kook was not enough. even now i do not wish to have him axed, but i do wish to express my disgust about this. "argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! i would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, i think). the issue that seems to be: "is the following an advertisement?" apparently, ted and mark think so... 1) i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 	*off the net* from last year. if reposting an article 	constitutes posting an ad, then i am guilty. this post 	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. if one 	had posted the address and subscription price of "newsweek", 	would that be an ad? i get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of 	"proof" that was requested by ted frank. he then complains 	to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and, lo and 	behold, "poof", there goes my account. this one had an 	address in it! oh, no! i guess that means it is an ad! if you value the alternative view i have been discussing, or value its discussion even if you do not agree with it, i ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. they rarely get "ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they only get "i don't like what that user is doing because...". please do not send the note to the sysadmin. i need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through. in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "thanks for the info" or "could you send me such and such?" or "your posts are very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "go aways". but, i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to convince ted is a net offense[tm] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (knock, knock..."my name is ted and and this is mark... we're from the thought police. seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...") nwo indeed! guess i will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... thanks ted and mike. hope you are happy. i will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! your comments and support are requested. i can no longer post to news. i ask what this has accomplished... is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? not in my book. seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. images of waco.... ah, but alas... and all this when i am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the tax collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction. oh, well... it takes time to come up with the info requested, and i was just getting started. it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. further, what are ted frank's motivations for getting me axed? we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. hmmm... just who does he work for? the university of chicago which he "attends"(?) is well known as one of the biggest nwo supporters... and finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the boulder/denver area, i would greatly appreciate it. i am in the process of installing linux and so will be able to do uucp or maybe a tc/ip connection. any help here would be greatly appreciated. since i am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email very soon, i hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via: 	a. j. teel, sui juris 	c/o usps box 19043 	boulder, colorado, u.s.a. 	postal zone: 80308-9043 	 	or leave me voice mail at: c/o (408) 281-0434 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- selected messages from ted frank via sysadmin follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- with explicit reservation of all rights (u.c.c. 1-207) regards, -a. j. teel-, sui juris (ajteel@dendrite.cs.colorado.edu) --------------------------- >from barb@locutus.cs.colorado.edu mon apr 5 14:39:21 1993 received: from locutus.cs.colorado.edu by dendrite.cs.colorado.edu with smtp id aa14777 (5.65c/ida-1.4.4 for <ajteel@dendrite.cs.colorado.edu>); mon, 5 apr 1993 14:39:19 -0600 received: by locutus.cs.colorado.edu with smtp id aa15908 (5.65c/ida-1.4.4 for <ajteel>); mon, 5 apr 1993 14:36:54 -0600 message-id: <199304052036.aa15908@locutus.cs.colorado.edu> to: "ted frank" <thf2@midway.uchicago.edu> subject: re: list of documents cc: cstmr@locutus.cs.colorado.edu, csops@locutus.cs.colorado.edu, ajteel@locutus.cs.colorado.edu, vaxops@locutus.cs.colorado.edu reply-to: trouble@cs.colorado.edu in-reply-to: your message of mon, 05 apr 93 13:29:06 cdt date: mon, 05 apr 93 14:36:51 -0600 from: barb@locutus.cs.colorado.edu status: or -------- please ask ******* to stop advertising his wares on the network. thank you.

huge difference in a parliamentary system. your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. in the german weimar system, the chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest reichstag party; the chancellor was appointed by the president and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the reichstag. beyond that, the implication that hitler rose to the chancellorship because a majority of germans wanted nazi rule is false as well. before president hindenburg appointed hitler chancellor in january 1933, the german people did not show a particular desire to be led either by hitler or by the nazi party. these are the results of the march 1932 election for president, the closest hitler ever came to direct election: hindenburg 49.6%, hitler 30.1%, thaelmann 13.2%, duesterberg 6.8%. in the runoff election in april the results were: hindenburg 53%, hitler 36.8%, thaelmann 10.2%. so we can see that hitler personally was supported by only about a third of german voters. similarly, the nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in reichstag elections. that occurred in july 1932. in the november 1932 election the nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the reichstag. comparitively, the socialists had 121 and the communists 100. the communists had gained 11 seats, and the german national party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million of the nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). i think the other large party was the catholic center party (i don't know how many seats they had but i think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties. thus the nazi vote was on the decline at the time hitler was appointed chancellor. what brought hitler to power was *not* the demand of the german people for hitler or the nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country. germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population. instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the nazis, who were out to end the democratic process. in fact, part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation, like the communists, were also out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under. germany had already had a non-nazi chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the nazis had been the largest reichstag party, and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazis. if anything the nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote had begun to decline. hitler was not hindenburg's first choice to be chancellor, not even his second choice. first, von papen had been chancellor since june 1932. after the november election when the nazis *lost* seats, hindenburg first prevailed on von papen to remain as chancellor. but there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking. so then hindenburg turned to von schleicher, who became chancellor for two months. eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the nazis, who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a nazi chancellor. some of the nazi leadership, particularly gregor strasser who was the #2 man in the party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. but others, knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process. nevertheless, the country was governed for seven months by chancellors who were not nazis, even though the nazis were the largest reichstag party. the failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together. here's how william shirer puts it in _the rise and fall of the third reich_: the cardinal error of the germans who opposed nazism was their failure to unite against it. at the crest of their popular strength, in july 1932, the national socialists had attained but 37 percent of the vote. but the 63 percent of the german people who expressed their opposition to hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out. true, the german people supported hitler after he became chancellor. but that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him *before* he was in power. the german people were not crying out for hitler to take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. the leftist parties (socialists/communists) probably had more support in total than the nazis. hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over. ----- eric smith erics@netcom.com

if the heading is true, mr. frank should be ashamed of himself. nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the rights of others to voice their opinions. my idol lenny bruce once commented about "that asshole time magazine" when they advocated censorship of his material. time actually sided with the cops' and their arresting of bruce at his shows, whereby he routinely would say "cocksucker", then the cops would rush the stage to arrest him. my, how the times haven't changed... i can't help but think of how lenny would be received in today's politically correct arena. heck, i even support the right of neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets. and before mr. frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about anti-semitism...i'm jewish, a longtime member of aipac and the jnf, and have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups. i'm a regular contributor to every pro-israel group i can find, but i still support the right of people like arf to speak up and vomit his propaganda. i want to know just who these people are !!! i'm basing all this on the assumption that mr. frank did indeed write to some sysadmin requesting mr. teel to be admonished. if this is not the case, i hereby retract these nasties directed toward him. if not, i stand against mr. frank and his trashing of the first amendment. philip stromer

	 	 the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 13, 1993 	 remarks by the president, secretary of education richard riley and secretary of labor robert reich in goals 2000 satellite town hall meeting 	 chamber of commerce building washington, d.c. 8:30 p.m. edt 	 	 	 secretary riley: good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of april. 	 	 you know, today is april 13th. in 1743, thomas jefferson was born, 250 years ago. i think that's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country. the success of our democracy according to jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system. 	 	 his philosophy of government, his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening. tonight we're so pleased to have with us president clinton. he's come over from the white house to join us in the chamber of commerce studios. 	 	 mr. president, it's good to have you. we thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening. 	 	 also we have with us secretary of labor robert reich. and, bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also. 	 	 i have some questions for our two guests, and i'm sure many of you do, too. so please call us if there's something that you'd like to ask. the number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782. in washington, d.c. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171. 	 	 i believe the president has a few words that he might want to share with us. and, mr. president, i'll ask you to do that at this time. it's great to have you. 	 	 the president: thank you very much, mr. secretary. 	 	 i'm glad to be here with my friends, dick riley and bob reich -- also members of my cabinet -- at the headquarters of the chamber of commerce to support the effort that the chamber is making, along with its center for work force preparation, to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place. 	 	 i want to compliment the chamber on all their efforts, recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen. 	 	 this satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together. and if you'll forgive me a little home state pride, i want to say a special word of thanks to the wal-mart corporation, headquartered in bentonville, arkansas, for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight. i appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you. 	 	 i have tried as hard as i could to move toward constructive change for this country. secretary riley talked about this being thomas jefferson's 250th birthday. if thomas jefferson believed in anything, he believed in these three things: first, in education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change. 	 	 if you go to the jefferson memorial here in this beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms, you will see jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times. 	 	 for us here in america, that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world. we're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better. unless we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the long run. 	 	 we also have to have people who can carry their load. and in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime. it's not just important what you know, but what you can learn. 	 	 and if i might, i'd like to close just by emphasizing we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the labor department and the education department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition. and we're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time. 	 	 dick, i think i ought to stop there. that's a good place we can begin, i think, the discussion. 	 	 secretary riley: thank you so much, mr. president. 	 	 each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals. and tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work. 	 	 this week, the education department and the labor department are hosting a conference here in washington, d.c. called summer challenge, a program of work and learning, to america's youth. the aim is to use some special funds from president clinton's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country. 	 	 mr. president, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the summer youth challenge. your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs. and why in your words is that so important? 	 	 the president: i think it's important for two reasons. first of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning. and while we want them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime. and that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before. 	 	 secondly, we want to help these young people progress, not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning. we want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners. and we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on. 	 	 secretary riley: well, i think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year, is really even greater. 	 	 secretary reich, of course, you have training programs throughout the year. and i wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training. 	 	 secretary reich: well, what we've learned, mr. secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning. many young people, for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry. but when they actually are there building something or working on something, and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry, they understand what it's used for. and a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important. it's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer. 	 	 secretary riley: thank you. 	 	 mr. president, you've called for a youth apprenticeship program, school-to-work transition. and i wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing. 	 	 the president: well, first of all, let's talk about why it's important. most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma. 	 	 if you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade. the young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their employers. 	 	 so we think america has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes two years of further training either in a community college, a vocational setting, or perhaps on the job. and what i have done in this budget, as you know, is to give you and secretary reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, based on the needs of the economy in any given area. it could revolutionize long-term the quality of the american work force and the earnings of american workers. 	 	 secretary reich: i should add, mr. president -- i think you know this from your experience in arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many of our states, building a school-to-work transition program. in fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement. the people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that. and more power to them. secretary riley and i are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there. 	 	 secretary riley: bob, we're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning career academies. and what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important? 	 	 secretary reich: well, one thing that we've seen -- and you and i have been working at this for a long time, and you much longer than i -- we've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential. and i'm so delighted that we're doing this in the headquarters of the chamber of commerce. the chamber of commerce of the united states is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've aimed to work very closely with the chamber. 	 	 the business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future. 	 	 communities have got to come together. i mean, this is one of the most important things. you've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together. you know, too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody is talking, but they're not really working together in a common strategy. 	 	 and the third and final ingredient i would say, dick, would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence. this is not a tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to make it. this is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for. if they want to go on beyond that to four-year college, that's fine. that ought to be permissible. but we're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation skills for on-the-job learning. 	 	 and again, those are the critical components. it's already being done. 	 	 the president: i think -- if i might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, but also in monitoring that excellence. if you have the right sort of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them. so i think that's very important. 	 	 and when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile. 	 	 secretary riley: that's great. we've been talking, of course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall. but let's talk just a moment about long-term school reform. it's something especially close to me. mr. president, i wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on goals 2000 legislation that i think will be coming forth before too long. 	 	 the president: well, as you know, back when you and i were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize. 	 	 i had a hand in writing the national education goals that the governors drafted, along with representatives of president bush's administration back in 1989. and what we're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, disciplined, and drug-free. and, of course, the fifth goal --i took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country. 	 	 and each one of those goals there's a national role, a state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector role. and what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; and then to give the rest of america a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet. 	 	 it's very exciting. so far as i know, nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before. not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job. i'm really excited about it. 	 	 secretary riley: well, i am, too. and i think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts, all driven by high standards. that's the point. 	 	 bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to the telephone calls. it's about the same subject. we have, of course, skills standards that are going to be part of goals 2000, and i wonder if you would comment on that. 	 	 secretary reich: well, you know, we have 75 percent of our young people who don't graduate from college. very often they don't have very many alternatives. they do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential, many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs. 	 	 everybody doesn't have to go to college. other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical, preprofessional skills. we can do it in this country. if you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser. and we want to develop those national skill standards. we're going to be working with the states, with the education department, with a lot of private industry in developing those standards. and i think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around, as well as our business community. 	 	 secretary riley: well, that's great. why don't we go ahead and go to the telephone. we have a call, i see -- mayor bruce todd of austin, texas. 	 	 q	 yes, mr. president and mr. secretary reich and riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today. we have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative. let me simply say, amen to some of the comments made already. we agree with much of the tone that the clinton administration has taken, and are very supportive. 	 	 we have been successful here in austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years. we expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance. 	 	 much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike. but the question essentially involved what initiatives after labor day would be appropriate. we know summertime is important. year-round is even more important. and what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis? and perhaps more importantly, how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative? that's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort. 	 	 secretary riley: mr. president. 	 	 the president: i think i'll give everybody a chance to answer the question, bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in austin. i've seen some of it and i've always been very impressed. 	 	 first, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector, too. we hope that -- secretary reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer. and we're working on that. 	 	 secondly, in the program that i have presented to the congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis. 	 	 and i will say again, to echo what secretary reich said a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning. an awful lot of young people actually have quite high iqs, but actually learn so much better when they're doing than when they're reading or just listening. so we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question. 	 	 bob, do you want to say anything? 	 	 secretary reich: well, you took most of the words out of my mouth, mr. president, as usual. but let me just add one thing, and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of jobs. and we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously. it's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the economy back on track. that's sort of the prerequisite to everything else. if we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- i think this is the 16th -- correct me if i'm wrong, mr. president -- i think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater. this is a jobless recovery. a lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in june. and even if we did everything right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs. 	 	 secretary riley: thank you both. of course, goals 2000 will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year. it will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways. and then the state, with all the various school districts, a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement. and i think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that moving. 	 	 the next call is dr. harry heinemann, new york. 	 	 doctor? 	 	 q	 good evening, mr. secretary. it is a pleasure to be on with you this evening. as you may know, bridging the school and work has been central to la guardia's educational program since its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages we have forged with the local schools. we have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy. 	 	 and over the years, we've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work. and these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the development of high performance competencies. 	 	 my question, then is: how can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience? and what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration? 	 	 secretary riley: well, thank you very much. i think -- and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting work going on there. we're going to have three people, our next guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists in that area that you're speaking, and i'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later. 	 	 you all care to comment -- any comments you might have? 	 	 the president: i'd just like to say, if i might, one thing. i want to reemphasize this and i don't think i'm being as clear about it as i'd like, although i think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than i. i think this whole concept of applied academics is very important. and i think that we have to basically abolish what i consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning. 	 	 i think we should keep the liberal arts going. i think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program. 	 	 secretary reich: it seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students. they're important for all students. it's not just a special group of students that needs them. 	 	 some of the experiments that i've seen around the united states -- dick, i'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments. they're mainstreaming all the students. at 11th and 12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program. and again, the kids can either go on to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions. 	 	 but we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools. 	 	 secretary riley: thank you, very much. i think that's going to be the last call that we have time for. mr. president, i think you've got to move on to another matter, and i want to thank you and secretary reich for being here. we appreciate your time and your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us. end9:00 p.m. edt

[procedural note: ted directed followups to misc.legal only. while i respect his right to do so, my own opinions are that (1) "followup-to" fields are mere suggestions, not mandatory commands and (2) this issue is of sufficient (a) general political relevance and (b) civil liberties interest to warrant keeping it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l as well, at least for this round.] in article <1993apr11.155955.23346@midway.uchicago.edu>, thf2@midway.uchicago.edu said: > uh, no. that's not what happened in _boomer_. what happened in > _boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail > the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut > down over $185,000 in damages, and required the plant to pay the > plaintiffs the $185,000 to make them whole. the plant would never > have been shut down-- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just > negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer > an amount greater than $185k to having the plant shut down, while the > plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have > the plant continue in operation. everyone's property rights were > protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement > costs were avoided. okay, now here's my interpretation of _boomer_, based on the facts as presented in the new york court of appeals<*> holding (_boomer v. <*>note: the new york court of appeals is the highest court in new york state. while the united states and 48 of the fifty states call their highest court "supreme court," "supreme judicial court" or "supreme court of appeals," maryland and new york call theirs simply the "court of appeals." to make matters worse, new york also calls its _second-highest_ court the "supreme court, appellate division"... atlantic cement co._, 26 n.y.2d 219, 257 n.e.2d 870 (1970)): oscar h. boomer, et al., owned land near the atlantic cement company's plant near albany, n.y. (the fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.) in the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant. the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop damaging their property. (commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me. boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. atlantic cement's actions were depriving boomer et al of that right.) instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that atlantic cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages. in other words, the court granted atlantic cement co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain. a taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong. (yes, i know, the _boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain. but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...) let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that "what happened in _boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages." blackmail? (pulls out black's law dictionary, abridged 5th edition.... "blackmail: unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose disgraceful defects. this crime is commonly included under extortion statutes.") how do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying? or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price? as i see it, boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which atlantic cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted. there isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings. you go on to say: "the plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185k to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation." if so, so what? since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties? if atlantic cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't atlantic cement have thought of that before going _into_ business? (i note that as far as the facts show boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was atlantic cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.) and then you say: "everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided." as above, i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole." they were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them. and for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole. and again i ask: since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided? (if so, i've been miseducated -- i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > is _boomer_ really being taught as "infamous?" that's really sad if > it is, because i fail to see how it's less than completely sensible. > you should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of > filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever > inexplicable reasons. (1) _boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my school. (aside: northeastern law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as torts, where i first encountered _boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally. when the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory professional responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by law school professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions. this is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar. end of aside.) i called it infamous because that's my opinion of it. for the reasons i've stated above, i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call "economic correctness" over justice. (2) it is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement's wrongful acts. (and if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.) > you'd like posner, bill. he's a libertarian. really? i didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _boomer_? > of course, he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a > president, democrat (won't like his antitrust stance) or republican > (won't like his support of gay marriage), and if bright law students > "shiver" at what they don't understand, it's easy to imagine how the > press will play it up as baby-selling. (i've seen mike godwin claim > that posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything > and is the end-all and be-all, when posner says precisely the > opposite.) so it goes. i've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as "law and economics" is weak. if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine. but as illustrated by _boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case. -- william december starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

	in the hopes of adding a little life to, what seems to be, the same old debates, i would like to add a few bits of info and ask for comments. 1) a couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof that the north vietnamese had held u.s. hostages after the war ended. 	way back in today's newspaper (page a7 of san francisco chronicle) there is an article about the document that held the proof. 	[used without permission] 	"the document, which was discovered in the archives of the soviet communist party in moscow, is a russian translation of what is described as a september 1972 report prepared for the vietnam politburo by general tran van quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the north vietnamese army." [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205 americans in north vietnamese prisons] 	"phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a fabrication is to review quang's career. in 1972, he said, quang was not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in military region 4 in central vietnam." 2) i heard on the radio that the church of scientology has filed for bankrupcy becuase the employees of cocolat , owned by cos, filed a class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues to become members of the church. anyone heard more about this? 3) micheal jackson went into business with micheal milken. no lie. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "who said anything about panicking?" snapped authur. garrett johnson "this is still just culture shock. you wait till i've garrett@ingres.com settled into the situation and found my bearings. then i'll start panicking!" - douglas adams ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

here is a press release from the reserve officers association. reserve officers say demographics ignored in nominations to close naval, marine reserve centers to: national desk, defense writer contact: herbert m. hart of the reserve officers association of the united states, 202-479-2258 washington, april 13 /u.s. newswire/ -- the reserve officers association of the united states has alerted the defense base realignment and closure commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 naval and marine corps reserve centers. in letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including sen. sam nunn (d-ga.), chairman of the senate armed services committee, roa charged that the developers of the navy-marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel. roa's executive director, maj. gen. evan l. hultman, aus (ret.), suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the naval reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's total force of the future." he asked the commission "to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action." "only a few of the 56 naval and marine corps reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed," wrote hultman. "the major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations." hultman reminded the commission, "the fact that the vast majority of the reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the navy and marine corps reserve. roa also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of naval reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 naval reserve facilities. if the navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 naval reserve facilities." facilities on the list include seven naval air stations ranging from south weymouth, mass., to alameda, calif., 28 naval reserve centers in macon, ga., and parkersburg, w.va., to missoula and great falls. mont. naval/marine corps reserve centers include four in san francisco, fort wayne, ind., billings, mont., and abilene, texas. a major marine reserve center on the list is that at el toro, calif., plus six others. -30- -- nigel allen, toronto, ontario, canada ndallen@r-node.hub.org

the white house office of the press secretary _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 14, 1993 	 remarks by the president at summer jobs conference 	 	 hyatt regency crystal city, virginia 11:22 a.m. edt 	 	 the president: thank you very much. the speech that octavius gave says more than anything i will be able to say today about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of people like jerry levin and nancye combs and pat irving and all of those who are here. 	 	 i want to thank the secretaries of labor and education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my good friend, governor wilder, for being here and for speaking; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around america who are here. 	 	 this has been a pretty fun day. (laughter.) i loved hearing the young people sing. it was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about. (applause.) a year and a half ago i began the quest to seek the presidency because i was concerned about their future. because i believe that our country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to take us into the future. 	 	 i entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people. but in the process we might recreate the best of america's community, knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future. 	 	 all of you here today are committed to that. the 1,000 jobs that jerry levin has committed time-warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, and those who are around the country. the work that nancye combs does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage, and especially the eloquent statement octavius jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're on the right track. 	 	 last july when i was traveling across america's heartland in my luxurious bus, i visited seneca high school in louisville, kentucky. and there i met young people and business people who were participating in the louisville education and employment partnership. i saw what nancye combs talked about today. i saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work. i saw, as i have seen many times in my own state, the principle illustrated that octavius has talked about -- that for millions of american young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning. 	 	 in the world in which we are living, the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime. we must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better. and we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today. 	 	 whether you're in business or in government or in education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all of our people. there are still a lot of people who say, well, things are pretty good here in washington and everything's fine; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing. they all have jobs. (laughter.) all the people who say that. (applause.) 	 	 they all have health insurance. they all have a pretty good education. and they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they'll be okay no matter what happens. i say that not to be either political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work for them to do. 	 	 all the european countries have higher unemployment rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the unemployed. the japanese unemployment rate has been going up. they're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that i have proposed to create jobs. 	 	 in west germany alone, the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours. this is a big problem for advanced nations. it costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people. 	 	 but it is especially important for america for two reasons: one is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this. the second is, even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors. people need to be able to work in this country. (applause.) 	 	 we have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some of it is normal. you've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another. we have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs. but in the whole, we must still be able to create jobs in a country like america, to provide people with the chance to work. 	 	 it's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that i will make to congress in the next couple of months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job. (applause.) 	 	 so we have two tasks. one is to develop the capacity of the american people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth. the other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck. it is a great challenge. i do not pretend that all of the answers are simple. but i know if you want to ask the american people, all of them, to be more responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you have got to have opportunity in that mix. 	 	 a part of our vision for america has to be a future for every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow. there has to be something at the end of that rainbow. and that is what we are basically here to talk about today: what can we all do as partners, recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background. and then, what can we do to make sure that there's something there for them to do? 	 the summer jobs program we're discussing today is an integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness, community. it will put the people first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector. 	 	 i said when i addressed the united states congress in february on this program that i would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the american business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before. 	 	 many, many people have responded to that challenge. and jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience. and it is terribly important. 	 	 i want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the american people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go. 	 	 all these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan. it's also important, as i said, that we create more jobs. the emergency jobs program that i asked the congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent. it would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created. 	 	 it also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment. 	 	 the summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the labor department and the education department and through reaching out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the united states government has never fully emphasized before. 	 	 a lot of these young people, as you well know, because they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other areas. and a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year. 	 	 what we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment. 	 	 there will be more applied academics, more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future. 	 	 the summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs. they're designed to make a future for the people holding the job. and that's what they will do. in the process, they'll help to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve local problems. real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, and learning all the way. challenging young people to learn while they earn, but letting them earn. 	 	 you know, it's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the opportunity that's at the end of the effort. i have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't exactly popular to say it, and say i wanted to reform the welfare system; i wanted to toughen child support; i wanted to require people to work; i was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets, and i wanted to change all that. but if you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity. (applause.) 	 	 the young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom. they will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat. they will have a sense of accomplishment. it will literally be a summer challenge, but a challenge that will take them into a different life. 	 	 so i want to ask all of you to support this effort even as i, as your president, support your effort. at the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate. we'll see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved ahead. i suspect that they will. 	 	 this summer, secretary reich and secretary riley and i will be visiting many of your communities. we'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well. 	 	 we want to honor the companies and the communities, the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer. and, again, i want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort, i thank you. and to all of you who haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today, i want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer. i'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when we don't give these children anything to say yes to. if we exhort them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them. (applause.) 	 	 when the other speakers were talking, i was sitting up here on the platform, listening and reveling. and they got talking about work, and i got to thinking about all the different things i've done to make a living in my life. when i was 13, i made a very foolish short-term business investment: i set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books. made more money than i had ever had in my life. but if i had saved those trunks, they'd be worth $100,000 today. (laughter.) 	 	 that does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial. it just means that you can't foresee a generation ahead. i have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership. and i've done a lot of different things for a living. some people say i got into politics to escape work. (laughter.) 	 	 i learned something from every job i ever had. but i grew up in a generation where i literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a job. i grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is, get an education and you'll be all right. you'll get a job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year. now i live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life. and we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want. 	 	 now, i want to close by reemphasizing these two things: it doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector, if young americans don't get a good education, don't learn how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created in this country. machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages. so nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of america's work force. and anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding. 	 	 on the other hand, we need to be honest. every wealthy country in the world, including the united states, is having difficulty creating jobs. if i knew everything that needs to be done i'd be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberations of congress and everything else. i don't have all the answers. but i know this: doing nothing is not the answer. (applause.) 	 	 and so the jobs program that i have presented to congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the counties, through the community development program, with the infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget. it is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again. 	 	 most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government money. and the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the american economy obviously will come from the private sector. that's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well. 	 	 but this is the challenge we have. so i ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the united states government should create this summer, so that together we can have this partnership. because more than anything else, we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in. 	 	 we need to send them a message that here in america if you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country. you can build a future from you own dreams. 	 	 that has always been the promise of america. together that's what this summer of challenge needs to be: a reaffirmation of the promise of america for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion. we can make it a reality. 	 	 thank you very much. (applause.) end11:45 a.m. edt
the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 14, 1993 press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room 12:40 p.m. edt 	 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i guess i'm just prepared to take questions today. 	 	 q	 george, bob dole says that the clinton administration's policy on bosnia is a failure and that he wants the united states to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the bosnian muslims can defend themselves. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as you know, president clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration. obviously, this is a tragic situation in bosnia. and if the bosnian serbs don't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo. in the meantime, we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the u.n. we're going to continue to work on the serbs to come to the negotiating table. but the prospect of an arms embargo is something the president certainly will consider if the serbs don't come to the table. 	 	 q	 how much longer are you going to give them to come to the table, george? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're working on that right now. 	 	 q	 it's been a long time. 	 	 q	 on february 19th, the president mentioned the value added tax in ohio. and when he was asked about it later by reporters, he said -- quote -- "that is a radical change in the tax system of the united states. it's something i think we may have to look at in the years ahead." questioned again about it later he says, "it is not something that is now under consideration. if we start considering it, i'll tell you." it wasn't a trial balloon or anything, he said. i was just discussing the tax response to a question. donna shalala, quoted in usa today this morning -- quote - - "certainly we're looking at a vat." what's gone on? 	 	 q	 the same with alice rivlin this morning. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the health care task force is reviewing a number of options. they haven't made any decisions yet. and as i have said from this podium time and time again, we're not going to comment on decisions that haven't been made. 	 	 q	 but you have also said from this podium time and time again -- 	 	 q	 wait a minute. whoa, nelly. whoa. 	 	 q	 that that was not under consideration. 	 	 q	 yes. clinton says, "it is not something that is now under consideration." is that no longer true? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe the working group, as ms. shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been made of any kind. 	 	 q	 well, i know. but he said he'd tell us about it if it was ever under consideration. i take it that now he is and he didn't tell us about it or -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed? 	 	 q	 "if we start considering i'll tell you." 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: if it's something to be proposed? 	 	 q	 "if we start considering it, i'll tell you." that's a direct quote. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the task force has looked at a number of different options. they have not made any decisions yet. the president has not made any decisions yet. this is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system. they have cast a very wide net. they have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals. but the president has not made any decisions. 	 	 q	 well, is the president aware of their consideration of this option? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind. i don't know that that's gotten to his level. he started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and i don't believe that that's been presented to him, no. 	 	 q	 well, he's not relying on the usa today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, he's going through it in a very deliberate fashion. there are a number of decisions that have to be made. i don't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point. 	 	 q	 if this is still under consideration, that's a change, at least from what we've been told by dee dee, i think about three weeks ago or so. she said, that is not an option, talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so i remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice. is that not the case? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't know if this has been presented to the president as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force. 	 	 q	 it was ruled it out, though. i mean, unlike other options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled out. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, this is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind. i mean, it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase. the working groups are looking at hundreds of different options. 	 	 q	 if it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now, then something has changed, george. yes, no? 	 	 q	 when a guy says in february -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options. 	 	 q	 so something's changed. they weren't looking at it before; they're looking at it now. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i don't know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet. they are casting a very wide net. 	 	 q	 how was it possible that you and dee dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that, in fact, it is being considered? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, the working groups are looking at a wide range of options. they have not -- 	 	 q	 do you deny that you and dee dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't deny that -- i mean, those are the president's words. those are very clear. 	 	 q	 subsequent to the president's words, do you deny that within the last month you and dee dee have both publicly ruled it out? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know about the timing. i think what we did was refer back to the president's words and say they stand. 	 	 q	 so don't they stand any longer? 	 	 q	 march 25th, clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, those words -- the president did say that in february. the working groups are on a separate track, and as i said, i don't believe -- 	 	 q	 separate from the president? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't believe this has been presented to the president. 	 	 q	 are they considering something that the president -- 	 	 q	 has ruled out? 	 	 q	 has ruled out? i mean, will the president consider a vat tax? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, the working groups have not presented this to the president. they have looked at a wide range of options. i suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly listen to it. that does not mean he has decided to do it. 	 	 q	 can we put this another way? in his answer in ohio, he looked at the vat in terms of restructuring the whole tax system. under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point. is that no longer the case, or is that the only way that he can see a vat emerging? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i guess i'm not sure exactly what you're asking. 	 	 q	 he talked about the vat in the context of a restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health care, for example. 	 	 q	 or anything else. 	 	 q	 or anything else. 	 	 q	 it was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: right. 	 	 q	 has that change, too? 	 	 q	 is that still his view? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i haven't spoken about those specific comments. i think -- i can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a vat? yes, they have. 	 	 q	 certainly we're looking at a vat, she said. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they have examined the possibility of a vat. has it been presented to the president? has he made a decision? no, he has not. 	 	 q	 what kind of a deal do you have when you've got the president's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at? is the president concerned about that sort of thing? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that the president's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible. he's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the different alternatives. if a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the president will explain and justify. but no decision has been made along those lines. 	 	 q	 what does it mean exactly, though, when the president rules something out? does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's just -- that's indisputably true. if you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in. he has not made a proposal. 	 	 q	 what makes him open to it now when he wasn't open to it before? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he's certainly willing to listen to the argument. 	 	 q	 was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in chilicothe? he's now open to it -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing, not something he was floating. 	 	 q	 not something he was considering. those are his words -- "it's not something that's now under consideration. if we start considering it, i'll tell you." you're now acknowledging, are you not, that it is under consideration and -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal. i am also stating that the president has not made a decision on it. 	 	 q	 but the door is open for the president to reconsider including this as part of -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: obviously, the working groups are looking at it. again, but the president has not made a decision. 	 	 q	 do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the vat to him? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know that. i assume that if -- i don't know what stage they are it in proposing. i don't know that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him. i know this is something the working groups are looking at. 	 	 q	 do you understand, george, that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the president has made, only about what the president is considering? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i understand that, and i am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a vat. 	 	 q	 and the president will consider it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him. 	 	 q	 does that mean the president -- that working groups think that when the president says no, he means maybe? (laughter.) 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible. 	 	 q	 george, can i ask you another question about bosnia? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sure. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 no, he wants us to stay on this. 	 	 q	 let's do gays in the military. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 no, he got out of that swamp. 	 	 q	 i think we've gotten the bottom line on that vat. reggie bartholomew, your special ambassador in belgrade, today said that if the serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- "we will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies." that seems to go a bit further than what you've just said -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sounds almost exactly what i just said. 	 	 q	 well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept what reggie -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the president has said that this is something that's under consideration. it is something he will consider if the current actions don't bring the serbs to the table. 	 	 q	 isn't there some kind of timetable here? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, there is a timetable. there's going to be a vote on the u.n. resolution in about 10 days. 	 	 q	 that's on sanctions, that's on tightening the sanctions. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's right, that's sanctions. and we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope that that will bring the serbs to the table. as you know, mr. bartholomew also met with mr. churkin of russia, and they are also working on ways to bring the serbs to the table. we will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well. 	 	 q	 the question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, not the sanctions. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the next vote in the u.n. is on sanctions. as far as i know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo. but it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies. 	 	 q	 why did reggie bartholomew tell the serbs that the u.s. would do that? what was the point of his telling them that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, clearly, i mean, this is something that's under consideration, and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table. they should know the consequences of failing to come to the table. 	 	 q	 have they been given a deadline? 	 	 q	 warren christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn't seemed to change the serbs' behavior in the least. why should the serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in bosnia? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i just don't accept the premise of your question. it has had an effect; the embargo is having an effect. 	 	 q	 what effect? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: if the serbians choose not to heed our warnings, then they will face the consequences. 	 	 q	 what effect has it had in bosnia? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the effect that it has had on the serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through. we can brief more fully -- 	 	 q	 in bosnia, george. in bosnia what effect has it had? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to date. that is why we're continuing to press for the serbians to stop. but we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the serbs and that will have an effect. i'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't happened overnight. but we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the serbs. if it fails to work and if the serbs fail to come to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo. 	 	 q	 isn't there a working deadline, george, of the 24th -- the same date as the u.n. -- the scheduled u.n. vote? hasn't the united states said, along with many of the other nato allies, that if the serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we've said continually we're going to -- 	 	 q	 but on that deadline? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't have a specific date, but we're going to move forward with the resolution, the u.n. resolution, by around that time. and if that fails to take effect, if that fails to bring the serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other actions. 	 	 q	 isn't this awfully incremental? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're taking a step-by-step approach. we're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to continue to do that. 	 	 q	 is there a possibility, george, that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think the purpose is to get the serbs to stop the aggression. we are pursuing that goal on many different fronts. we are pursuing it through the u.n.; we're pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions. and we will consider lifting the arms embargo. we are turning the screws up on the serbs and we will continue to do that. 	 	 q	 but if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the serbs give back what they've gained? i mean, once they're entrenched -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i can't speculate on that. we're going to continue to press for them to come to the table now. we're going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression. but i can't see into the future. 	 	 q	 george, on the stimulus package, house republicans say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on saturday to try and explain the details of your package. they cite polls which show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it. what's your strategy to counter that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the strategy we have is the one we're going to continue. as you saw, the president today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide: 700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work. we are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways. we're going to point up the benefits of immunization. we're going to point up the benefits of head start. we are going to say that the republicans have a choice: they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. 	 	 q	 does it concern you, though, that the house now, the house republicans are after you as well as the senate? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the house republicans voted against it before. they made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now. 	 	 q	 george, does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the president did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a reaffirmation of a promise of america"? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not at all. i think it's the promise of america to give kids a chance to reach their full potential. 	 	 q	 government-funded jobs? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: to give people a chance to work? absolutely. that is the promise of america. 	 	 q	 i want to follow up on something i asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that is on top of. i did look at it. there are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline. this will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million. 	 	 q	 the 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 where does that number come from? because we've been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs. and according to panetta, that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, but the summer -- that's when you do their full-time equivalence. i mean, 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer. when you calculate it for the full-time job effect, you have to do -- i don't know what the exact formula is. 	 	 q	 seven hundred thousand part-time jobs -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: -- 150,000 or -- 	 	 q	 one to four because it's three months. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: thank you. 	 	 q	 can i follow up on that? did the president misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not necessarily. i mean, i think that there will be grants available. that's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs. at the same time, he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well. 	 	 q	 tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to work at time-warner? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think the time-warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant. that's going to be the bulk of it. there could be isolated instances, though, where there would be grants to businesses. 	 	 q	 has the president spoken with any senate republicans this week? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, but there's been a lot of contact with senate republicans in the white house. 	 	 q	 at a lower level. but the president hasn't? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president has not, no. 	 	 q	 getting any closer to get the votes? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're continuing to work on it. 	 	 q	 anybody leaning your way? 	 	 q	 on haiti, the new york times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in aristide's attitude towards the coup leaders. can you confirm that there has been this change, and what impact will it have on the process? and what did pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: pezzullo did brief the principals. i can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks. i would leave that to the negotiators themselves. but mr. caputo has returned to haiti. we have received a briefing here at the white house from ambassador pezzullo. and as we have said time and time again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement. 	 	 q	 george, yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities. can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think we have it for most states, yes. and i think we can get it out. 	 	 q	 could you make that generally available? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe we can. 	 	 q	 and could you do it by the component of the stimulus? in other words -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if we can do -- i know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs. i don't know how deeply it can be broken down. but clearly, we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs. 	 	 q	 and can i follow up? is this the information that jeff eller and the rest of the white house is using in the ads in the states? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if they're ads, but they're press releases. 	 	 q	 can you describe what those press releases contain? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: all we're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states. for instance, i know that today senator dole is heading up to vermont and new hampshire. and i would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in vermont. it creates 2,000 jobs in new hampshire. and the people of those states should remind him that this is important. 	 	 q	 where are the releases going? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they go to the states. 	 	 q	 to whom? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we can get them. it's no problem. 	 	 q	 can we get it? 	 	 q	 why don't you put them out here as well? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think we can. 	 	 q	 this afternoon? would that be possible? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'll have to check. i don't know. but as soon as we can. 	 	 q	 are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic republican senators? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think we're trying to get as many as we can. it's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we're doing our best. we're putting them out as we get them. 	 	 q	 why are you so closely tracking senator dole's schedule? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i was just following it. 	 	 q	 are press releases going along to states where he's visiting? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure. i think that probably there are press releases going to vermont. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting? (laughter.) 	 	 q	 george, as the president goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what seems to be the republicans' main point, that you're funding it with deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up with the funding for it" seems to be the republican argument. and how do you answer that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: what was answer is, we are paying for it over time. and if you look at our budget, we pay for this package over time. we believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs. 	 	 q	 you're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add to the deficit this year? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm saying we're paying for it over time. i didn't say that. 	 	 q	 i know that, george. but i mean, from the beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: this year they clearly will. but over time our budget fully pays for this program. 	 	 q	 what you're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely. that's exactly what i said. 	 	 q	 i know that, but there is going to be outstanding debt, it will add to the national debt from this year -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, we're reducing the deficit by $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years. 	 	 q	 you mean you're reducing it below what it would have been? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: exactly. 	 	 q	 in fact, you're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: but we're reducing it far more from what it would have been. that's true. 	 	 q	 washington-type reduction. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 you're getting to be a grumpy old man. 	 	 q	 george, has any decision been made about the white house or the president's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're working on the president's schedule now. i believe he's going to be at the senate democratic retreat in jamestown that weekend. 	 	 q	 will he address it by phone? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know about that. it's a little far out, but i believe he's going to be in the senate retreat. 	 	 q	 so will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. i would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups. i don't know the schedule on it, though. 	 	 q	 will there be an aids czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm just not sure. 	 	 q	 april 22nd is earth day. what is the president going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i know there's been some work on the biodiversity treaty. i don't know about signing it that day, but i would expect he'll have a statement on earth day or right around then. 	 	 q	 where is the work on the biodiversity treaty? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'd have to check with katie mcginty. i just know that there's been some work done, but i don't know exactly what. 	 	 q	 when is earth day? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the 22nd, i think. 	 	 q	 why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on earth day but you don't know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i said i don't know if he's going to meet or when he's going to meet. 	 	 q	 do you have a statement on the gay rights march? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't, actually, no. i wouldn't be surprised if he did, though. 	 	 q	 do you have some details on the miyazawa visit? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's a working visit on friday and the president is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including russian aid and the japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries. 	 	 q	 there was some expectations that a second aid package to russia was going to be unveiled at the g-7 meeting and, if i understand, it hasn't happened. why is that or what's the status on that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the g-7 meeting is still going on and, as you know, secretaries bentsen and christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package. but we're going to continue to consult with congress and our g-7 allies on that. 	 	 q?	 we will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the meeting's not over yet. 	 	 q	 is that when you're going to make one? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not ruling out the possibility. 	 	 q	 the president's going to announce it tomorrow. 	 	 q	 bentsen said that. 	 	 q	 yes, bentsen said it would be tomorrow. 	 	 q	 so did christopher. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'd have to look at that, but i believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of tokyo. 	 	 q	 george, has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the president out to los angeles? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know that there's -- it's not something we've ruled out. we don't have a date set for it. 	 	 q	 george, you all have a position or do you support immigration's plan to settle 4,000 iraqi prisoners in the united states? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's the first i've heard of it. 	 	 q	 george, there was a report today about the -- 	 	 q	 fortunately. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 about the pace of appointments and says that president clinton is behind president bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for. are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we filled 814 of the president's appointments. and it's broken down -- we have 384 schedule c; 147 noncareer ses; 213 pas full-time. i'm not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 pa full-time. and this is about the same -- it's about the same pace of president bush. obviously, as you move along farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments. so we expect the process to speed up. but we're at the pace of bush. obviously we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible. 	 	 i would point out that the fbi background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup. but we're working on it. 	 	 q	 is that because of nannygate? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's an awful big part of it, yes. 	 	 q	 in the story this morning, you were at approximately the same pace as bush in making appointments, but way behind in winning confirmations. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's where the background checks comes into play. that's the problem. 	 	 q	 that's the background checks problem? because i mean, you have a democratic senate -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, that's not the -- you make the appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done. that's exactly where the problem is. 	 	 q	 what's the president doing this afternoon, and what's on the plan for tomorrow? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he's got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues. and then he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the white house. and friday is the miyazawa meeting. 	 	 q	 will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, george? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: either tomorrow or friday. 	 	 q	 is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the japanese prime minister's visit tomorrow? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know about tomorrow, but we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these visits. 	 	 q	 was reverend jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he was here. he met with a group of us here at the white house, including mack mclarty. 	 	 q	 who? 	 	 q	 reverend jackson. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: reverend jackson. mack mclarty, me, gene sperling, bruce reed, jeff watson, mark gearan. 	 	 q	 talking about haiti? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we talked about general urban policy. he is about to go to los angeles. he was just back from mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going on to los angeles. 	 	 q	 did he request the meeting? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: actually, no. he's in continual contact with the president. he had written a letter on a variety of issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it. 	 	 q	 george, dole is having a fundraiser for jeffords tonight in vermont. have you guys been in contact with jeffords at all on this? 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think there's been some contact, sure. 	 	 q	 can you tell us about the contacts? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure -- 	 	 q	 do you know who contacted him or what was said? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i know that howard paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package. 	 	 q	 and did he express his support for it now, or is he -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i can't divulge the details of the conversation, but there have been conversations. 	 	 q	 the l.a. times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package. is this something the president is considering? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again -- 	 	 q	 along with the vat? (laughter.) 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's certainly something that's been looked at, but no decisions have been made. 	 	 q	 what was the question? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the l.a. times story on whether abortions will be covered by the president's health plan. 	 	 q	 did the president in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with reverend jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice about what kind of stance the white house should take in the wake of the verdict in l.a.? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, we certainly talked about the situation in los angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues. 	 	 q	 for instance, did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the president to go there or not? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, we discussed a wide range of issues related to los angeles. that was certainly one of them. 	 	 q	 letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, i need to go back to bosnia just for a second and ask -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, good. 	 	 q	 your reaction to margaret thatcher's comments that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, we've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action. we will continue to do that. 	 	 q	 can you tell us if you've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise? i mean, we don't have any feel except talks are ongoing. have you talked to like 20 people or -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know the numbers. we've talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions. 	 	 q	 anyone leaning your way? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i can't get into that. we're just going to keep working through tuesday. 	 	 the press: thank you. end 1:10 p.m. edt 	 #56-04/14

from: new liberation news service <nlns> subject: nlns: fascism with a friendly face /* written 8:33 pm apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */ /* ---------- "nlns packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93" ---------- */ fascism with a friendly face: does rush limbaugh remind you of anyone? daevid bornhuetter-machen, the madison edge "the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler was original and showed initiative." --mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show, abc radio network, october 27, 1992. (nlns)--believe it or not, i was planning this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh's transcribed rant, the way things ought to be before sahl issued his comparative review. as usual, sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel. 	my effort can only dream of comparing favorably to mort's. at least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone i'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery. 	those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the acts of those false prophets. both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for hitler in the april 1932 german election). both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt. 	the last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was "betrayed to france by a representative of his government" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement. 	in fact, the governments of both the reich and prussia, as well as the vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... god is unconstitutional." of course, it's not god but the official imposition of particular concepts of god against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. but limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that. 	of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that the way things ought to be is the modern american mein kampf. not really. at the time of the first german version of mein kampf, hitler was just four months out of prison (june, 1925), and trying to reorganize the nazis. he used the book to build his dozen million followers. limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. twelve million went a longer way in weimar germany that it does in the republicrat united states. 	thus, the more accurate parallels would be that limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the american mein kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that the way things ought to be is actually the american triumph of the will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. also, the printed word was the more important medium in weimar germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. today, on the other hand, americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words. 	but, as mort sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (and remember, sahl is an al haig conservative these days.) 	mort might not know exactly who rush's equivalent of rodolf hess is (the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin, the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh's partner in efm media, the radio program's production company). but mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in new york, washington and los angeles. he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. he knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as al capone did; it's almost worthy of a rico indictment. 	on questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seems to echo hitler's venom. for example: on their own qualifications to control society 	hitler: "out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" (page 577). 	limbaugh: "who needs the media when they've got me? ... the show is devoted exclusively to what i think ... [the phrase "with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... it might take four or five years, but i'm convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.) on religion as the basis of a nation 	hitler: "in this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan. his dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from paradise." (page 581.) 	limbaugh: "america was founded as a judeo-christian country ... but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... people for whom belief in god is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. is it only a coincidence that the quality of american education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.) on popular culture as a reason for social collapse 	hitler: "the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of state and culture." (pages 346 and 348.) 	limbaugh: "today, hollywood is in trouble. the reason [is] that hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... they make fun of people who believe in god. they ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. they disparage american heroes." (page 254.) on the news meida 	hitler: "the activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the german people and the german reich. one can pass by in silence the marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the jews." (page 331.) 	limbaugh: "elements of the media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. the cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... during the gulf war, cnn correspondent bernard shaw [said] cnn is a global network. we can't take sides. cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... if they don't realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may i suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.) * * * 	 to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading. 	after putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. in the 1920s, adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis. in the 1990s, rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened americans; in turn, it is helping the american radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the reagan-bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for the fascist states of america. 	and if limbaugh is not as repellant a hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. one can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook america on. the madison edge can be reached at po box 845, madison, wi 53701- 0845; (608) 255-4460. --- 30 ---

the white house office of the press secretary _______________________________________________________________ for immediate release	 	 	 april 14, 1993 text of a letter from the president to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate april 13, 1993 dear mr. speaker: (dear mr. president:) as part of my continuing effort to keep the congress fully informed, i am providing this report, consistent with section 4 of the war powers resolution, to advise you of actions that i have ordered in support of the united nations efforts in bosnia-herzegovina. beginning with u.n. security council resolution 713 of september 25, 1991, the united nations has been actively addressing the crisis in the former yugoslavia. the security council acted in resolution 781 to establish a ban on all unauthorized military flights over bosnia-herzegovina. there have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages in bosnia have been bombed. in response to these violations, the security council decided, in resolution 816 of march 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all unauthorized flights over bosnia-herzegovina and to authorize member states, acting nationally or through regional organi- zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance. nato's north atlantic council (nac) agreed to provide nato air enforcement for the no-fly zone. the u.n. secretary general was notified of nato's decision to proceed with operation deny flight, and an activation order was delivered to participating allies. the united states actively supported these decisions. at my direction, the joint chiefs of staff sent an execute order to all u.s. forces participating in the nato force, for the conduct of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by the united nations over bosnia-herzegovina. the u.s. forces initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 f-15 and 12 f-18a fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft. these aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. e.d.t. on april 12, 1993. the fighter aircraft are equipped for combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense. nato has positioned forces and has established combat air patrol (cap) stations within the control of airborne early warning (aew) aircraft. the u.s. cap aircraft will normally operate from bases in italy and from an aircraft carrier in the adriatic sea. unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order). if these steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by nato military authorities and in accordance with the approved more 	 	 	 	 	 	 (over)  2 rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will be necessary. the commander of unprofor (the united nations protection force currently operating in bosnia-herzegovina) was consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully considered before the rules of engagement were approved. it is not possible to predict at this time how long such operations will be necessary. i have directed u.s. armed forces to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional authority as commander in chief. i am grateful for the con- tinuing support that the congress has given to this effort, and i look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward toward attainment of our goals in this region. 	 	 	 	sincerely, 	 	 	 	william j. clinton # # #

"we do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world, 	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently 	unpredictable subject is impossible. even though we assume 	no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical 	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid 	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested." so the guys who are running the store for clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not exists. they are (borrowing an idea from the hitchhiker's guide) too advanced to think of these simple things. to be honist, i would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted phd and no experience do the same job. 					- bill woody normally i don't post (or even read most of the postings) in this newsgroup. if you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply, then i guess you will just have to reply directly to me.

the operation going on in somalia is a peacekeeping/peaceenforcement operation where force may be used. it is not a war. it is also legal under international law, which is higher than us law. the operation is occuring under the ageis of the united nations. can't get a higher authority than that on this earth.
what does anyone think that judge wopner would do if karadzic was on trial before him? (nevah happen, but just a thought...)
# 179 czech republic # 180 republic of slovakia they were admitted early this year. liechenstein was also recently admitted. also san marino. both within the last 12 months. incredible what passes for a nation-sta state nowadays.

in responding to the post below i have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but i have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the nazi party that i deal with. in article <1993apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (ken mcvay) writes: |>as dawidowicz points out, in "the holocaust and the historians," (harvard |>university press, 34-38): |> |>"...the nadir in hitlerology is reached by david irving's "hitler's |>war."<34> an amateur historian, whose reputation as a german apologist and |>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of |>notoriety, <35> irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that hitler |>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was "probably the |>weakest _leader_ germany has known in this century," and that he did not |>murder the jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed |>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent." let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? does this mean that hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter? one of the important things to realise about the nazis is that the system was far more evil than any single member. once created the nazi party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. remember that hitler did not originaly lead the nazi party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. had hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric. this is why all parties that espouse nazi style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the nazis. the idea that one "race" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of auschwitz. the nazi party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. the myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected. in the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. i would accept only the latter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness. it is important to understand that the nazis were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. they acted in the same manner as the spanish inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. the fault of the nazis lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. thus all such parties such as the national front or david dukes klu klux klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide. the conclusion that hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. it is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the nazis espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. the evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary. no matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. if this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. hatred is a supreme justifier. it also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. for many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. a rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. thus we have the us raid on tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. it is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. in the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology. it is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. the leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security. although it was inevitable that a party such as the nazis, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. realising that the individual cannot hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot affect the system. phill hallam-baker phill hallam-baker

(well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway. ;-) the other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. i've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see south american sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there. >>if you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would >>realize that: >> -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue > >directly contradicted by the nejm study that compared crime in seattle and >vancouver, b.c. the non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities. the >difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related. and as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related. that is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (blacks and hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical. the problem with the nejm study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities. that there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went. they failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions. if the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in seattle. yet the majority in seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower. >> -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city > >surprise. pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty, drug use, disease, >etc. since rates are lower in suburbia, us middle class folks can ignore the >problem. the point is, of course, that many of the u.s. "inner-city" problems are not mirrored in canada. as such if there is a condition which is significantly different in canada from the u.s., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of canada's low rate is highly questionable. (as one canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since. apparently they didn't even mirror the u.s.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties. >> -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already > >post hoc ergo propter hoc. those areas implemented gun control because of >the high rates. true only to a certain extent. take washington d.c., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards. similarly for new york. the question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low. did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime. since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it. yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime. but if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in canada. >similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control. as would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control. >and the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in >washington d.c. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there. would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ david veal univ. of tenn. div. of cont. education info. services group pa146008@utkvm1.utk.edu - "i still remember the way you laughed, the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft; i'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore." - "weird al"

simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension. the same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions. local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests. thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government. thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower. i mean, let's get real here. do we *really* need the congres of the united states deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?

i remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do. and if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that state. and since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact. the problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off" states, but that the congress has acquired too much power to sell pork. >|> it is not a case of the system of government they created failing, >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically >|>wanted to avoid. namely, a concentration of power. it would seem >|>then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either >|>house in some attempt to grease the wheels. all you'll get then is >|>a system which moves quicker to do stupid things. it would make more >|>sense to make more decisions at a local level. > >no, you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it. but why on earth should we want to redirect it? you said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through congress. if congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced. >the current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility >to come to a decision. the current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action. considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, i consider bias against making those decisions a good thing. >pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. in most cases they are worse, >not better. the difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate. and c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once. you get to see them tried out without a national decision. congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for. and while i often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least i have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off. i'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in washington with half a million or more constituents. i'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt. >|> i fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were >|>placed on the veto. it could just as easily have been read as a means >|>to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's >|>opinion) policies. > >since we were arguing from the federalist papers i would point to them. phill, *you* brought up the federalist papers. we were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senators should be allowed to hold up a bill. you claimed the senate was suppose to be a far less powerful house, and i contended there was nothing in the constitution or other writings which indicated this. which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the federalist papers. you argued against them, i never argued from them. i have primarily referred to the constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the senate than for the house. >the >us constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work. the >only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where >the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous. the u.s. constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document. the delcaration of independence was the high-brow reasoning.

the trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. the trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans. 	it's interesting that blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. i don't know the racial makeup of phoenix, so i can't speak to your situation. however, i live in san francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". here, we have black gangs, hispanic gangs, asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs, and even a few white gangs. the asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (i think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. but ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that black gangs and crime are what they most fear. during the "disturbance" in los angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not black. some were even white! i remember being amazed at television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two blacks at most! my perceptions, gleaned from tv news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in los angeles. this may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. yet i know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of america the popular perception is that it was a *black* riot! 	in closing, i'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. as a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. we cannot afford to do it much longer. i truly believe that the well-being of all of us depends on changing our current course of denial and repression. 	i wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the "trap". 	peace, my brother. 			m. -- 	hokh'ton	:	the crystal wind is the storm, mdouglas@netcom.com	:	 and the storm is data, michael douglas-llyr	:	 and the data is life. 			:		---player's litany (the long run)

in regard to woody's post, i thought i would remind him of something in the midst of his tirade against academia: as a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant laffer curve (not!) i think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us to directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt and continue to allow our economy to expand--and i don't remember woody and co. complaining about academia while laffer implemented his policy, stockman approved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up, and reagan completing the largest con job of the century which my generation and i will now have to pay for. jesse

"managed care" relies on hmo's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like canada, france and germany (i'm canadian, and my german father-in-law-to-be says of hmo/nhs approaches, "we left that behind with east germany!"). sure, hmo/nhs controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings. in canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in france and germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals. it is all pure insurance without hmo's. the divisions are different, with the germans using a couple hundred interlinked "sickness funds" over a century old while canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.) with such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that canada is #2 to the u.s. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. the french and germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy. gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ gary l. dare > gld@columbia.edu 			go winnipeg jets go!!! > gld@cunixc.bitnet			selanne + domi ==> stanley

(-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like britain's national health service. >"`you've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's >not as obvious. if you're poor and you don't have insurance, you don't > go to a surgeon. in the states you ration by ability to pay.'" for non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand. i have md friends who can't make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the cma medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the us) aside -- so they must move to larger places. however, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent and routine care, as has been done in the u.s. by consumers reports, health policy studies cited by prof. dennis e. shea on usenet, cnn, nyt, etc. doug fierro has posted a nyt article from 3 weeks ago about canada's health insurance approach, on talk.politics.medicine. there is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private. >wouldn't national health insurance mean that americans who are now >fully insured might have to settle for less?

the white house office of the press secretary (pittsburgh, pennsylvania) ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 17, 1993 	 interview of the president by michael whitely of kdka-am radio, pittsburgh 	 pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh, pennsylvania 10:40 a.m. edt 	 	 	 q	 for everyone listening on kdka radio, i'm mike whitely, kdka radio news. we're here at the pittsburgh international airport and with me is the president of the united states bill clinton. 	 	 and i'd like to welcome you to the area and to kdka. 	 	 the president: thank you, mike. glad to be here. 	 	 q	 there are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from los angeles. i guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four los angeles police officers. we just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, sergeant koon and officer powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty. 	 	 it's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict. and i wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in los angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do. 	 	 the president: well, first of all, i think the american people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case. 	 	 the law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated. the jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating. the jury acquitted an officer who kicked rodney king, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie. 	 	 no one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here. they acknowledged that his civil rights were violated. and i think that the american people should take a lot of pride in that. but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things: first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any american; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime. 	 	 i think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of los angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime. it's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the brady bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs. 	 	 and the last point i'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas. if you just think about it -- if everybody in los angeles who wanted a job had one, i don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do. 	 	 and i laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities. i have dispatched the commerce secretary, ron brown, to california to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country. i want to talk to him and to the attorney general, to the new head of the naacp, to reverend jackson, and to several other people, and then i'll decide where to go from here with regard to los angeles and the other cities of the country. 	 	 q	 let's talk about what brings you to the pittsburgh area today. there have been -- i guess there's been a lot of discussion on capitol hill about your stimulus package. you've been locked in a battle with the gop. yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock. what brings you to pittsburgh, in particular to allegheny county, in particular to pennsylvania, with that battle? 	 	 the president: well, there are two reasons. first of all, pittsburgh, allegheny county and pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy. we have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12. we reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country. 	 	 but in addition to that, i asked the congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more. the plan passed the house. it has the support of a majority of the senate. at the present time, all the republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill. that is, they won't let it come to a vote. 	 	 i believe that senator specter would like to vote for the bill. and i believe that senator dole, the republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the republicans to stay hitched. and they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit. it doesn't. this bill is well below the spending targets that congress approved, including the republicans, for this year. this bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years. this bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy. and i must say, a lot of the republican senators that are holding it up, when mr. bush was president, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs. 	 	 so what i'm trying to do is to break this logjam. i've held out an olive branch, i've offered a compromise. but i think that we ought to try to put some more americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country. and that's the purpose of the bill. 	 	 q	 have you been in touch with senator specter or his office lately? 	 	 the president: well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my white house congressional liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- senator specter, senator d'amato from new york, senator jeffords from vermont, senator hatfield from oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget i presented. 	 	 you know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more. but the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years. and more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that congress has already approved for this year. and they've done this for years, with the republicans voting for it -- many republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the american people back to work. 	 	 so i just hope that this doesn't become a political issue. it ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs. 	 	 q	 i have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration. it has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears. a lot of people who supported you and voted for you in pennsylvania --i think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the white house, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through. look at these problems. look at this gridlock. and they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off? and, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, i knew it was going to be like this. 	 	 the president: well, what i would -- i'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast. the budget resolution that the congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets. so we are moving really rapidly. and we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things. 	 	 but it's a big operation. you can't expect to turn it around overnight. it took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory i received from the people in november, and we can't turn it around in 90 days. but i think we're making real, real progress. 	 	 i would urge the people not to get discouraged. we're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight. but we are definitely moving and changing things. 	 	 q	 thank you very much. 	 	 the president of the united states, bill clinton, here live at pittsburgh international airport. i'm mike whitely, kdka news. end10:31 a.m. edt
the white house office of the press secretary (pittsburgh, pennslyvania) ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 17, 1993 radio address to the nation by the president pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh, pennsylvania 10:06 a.m. edt the president: good morning. my voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in america, kdka in pittsburgh. i'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs, health care and the economy. but i wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the american people. i'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year's presidential elections. over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that i adopted, along with vice president gore, in last year's campaign. every saturday morning i take this time to talk with you, my fellow americans, about the problems on your minds and what i'm doing to try and solve them. it's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable. you sent me to washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics. you know how important it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do business. we live in a competitive global economy. nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business, labor and government. although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored. that's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind. we have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs. we've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to show for it. we know that wages of most working people have stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care. but we also know that, given the right tools, the right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live. in many critical products today americans are the low cost, high quality producers. our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs. just two months ago i gave congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth. it changes the old priorities in washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future. these new directions passed the congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country. then the jobs plan i presented to congress, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the house of representatives. it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate. but it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the senate, just 43 senators. they blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs. the issue isn't politics; the issue is people. millions of americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in washington. but the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock. i know the american people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual. i know they don't want us to spin or wheels. they want the recovery to get moving. so i have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile. yesterday i offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion. it's not what i'd hoped for. with 16 million americans looking for full-time work, i simply can't let the bill languish when i know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people. the mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward. by taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting senate talkathon, i think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals. first, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses. we also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs. second, i've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent. and third, i've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people. i'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it. now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved. that sounds reasonable, doesn't it? here's what they don't say. this program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the congress this year. it's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the american people to work. this is not about deficit spending. we have offered a plan to cut the deficit. this is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics. keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar. it is paid for by budget cuts. and it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children. i urge all americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more american partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy. you know, if every american who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today. this bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again. but it's a step we ought to take. and it is fully paid for over the life of our budget. tell your lawmakers what you think. tell them how important the bill is. if it passes, we'll all be winners. good morning, and thank you for listening. end 10:11 a.m. edt

(this represented an increase of 230%) in 1980, income security (which includes retirement programs, housing assitance, and unemployment benefits, and i believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars. in 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started. (this represented an increase of 230%) in 1980, the federal government spent 32 billion dollars on medicare. in 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars. (an increase of 368%) in 1980, the feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like. in 1992 it was 87 billion. in 1980, health care services and research was 23 billion dollars. in 1992, it was 94 billion dollars. agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion. science, up 11 billion to 16 billion. resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion. education up 14 billion to 45 billion. veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion. trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion. about the only things i see which was seriously decreased was under the energy category, primarily under "supply," and "community development," in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars. where *was* this huge diversion? >in order to rectify this situation there must >be constitutional revision. not that's a stretch. if the current government was pushed by the president to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone? >secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed >circumsatnces of the role of the federal government. only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. i see very little positive about it. >the constitution >cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process. the constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened. nor do i see putting the brakes on the "democratic process" an inherently bad thing. califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse. >if the peoplr want >to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have >it. sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, "no," and pointed to their local government. >attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only >leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute. phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns? >methods will >always be found to bypass such provisions and once the government gets >used to bypassing those provisions they will bypass the others up to >the first ammendment. cute. we can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law. >this is a major reason why the right to own >guns should be excluded, the implication that this right is equal to >the right to free speech is dangerous. free speech alone is dangerous, phill. >people know that mass ownership >of lethal weapons causes thousands of murders a year, the dangerous >conclusion they may reach is that the first ammendment may also be >the same dangerous mistake. ok, phill. all you gotta show me is a clear pattern of *reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it.

joe, as usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining problems in our community. from your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with african americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. i never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. the socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, i mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. but nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. no, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction. basically, i think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. it could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. no, something is wrong with us. non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. i would get angry if it werent' so damn typical. peace - aaron

(btw, tennessee is considered a "tax heaven" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country. *i* see a correlation.) 1) what money we spend goes primarly to administration. the average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue. and 2) the governor is making a concerted effort to create an "education crisis" in order to push for his pet income tax. some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like state funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing. it's not a lack of funds. it's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate. education is *the* parental hot-button. education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art. >|> the u.s. constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document. the delcaration >|>of independence was the high-brow reasoning.

i bet that if you're an mp or mpp, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's "urgent" care list no matter how minor your problem. which is ok unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot. >>wouldn't national health insurance mean that americans who are now >>fully insured might have to settle for less? >> >>in canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental >>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private >>hospital rooms, -- so many canadians do end up buying some private >>insurance. a policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40 >>a month. hmm. how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting?

would the private insurers take up the slack? they'd be under no obligation to. of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling such basic services, too). > >>****************************************************************** >> >>wouldn't free care encourage people to run to the doctor for every >>ache and pain?

(they do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.) some facts. malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of total health care costs in the us. in 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance. malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985; they've declined significantly since then. at the same time, health care costs have increased more than any period in history. as far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the ama estimates that its total impact is about $7 billion per year. that's about 8% of the total current increase in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care. as small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however, clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of md's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties. this would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice. jsh -- steve hendricks | domain: steveh@thor.isc-br.com "one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - r. hofferbert | ma bell: 509 838-8826

ok phil, you're right. so far the "evidence" suggests that nixon was a victim of overzealous underlings and kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with a dash of megalomania. after crushing the cia and fbi who's to say kennedy wouldn't have created his own version of american friendly fascism? unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. so far this nation's citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of nixon's tapes. what's on the rest of those babies? some archivists have alluded that there is "evidence" to suggest that nixon and his cronies, including george bush, were aware of the plot to murder kennedy before he was shot in dallas. ask your local d.a. what the charges are for the above crime. and so i must ask you, phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out when you and i are old men, i would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole up your ass and parading you down main street with a sign on your chest: "i was an apologist for the american fascist regime circa 1944 -- 2010" (how's that for a lovely brecht-ian image:-) there, that ought to get a reaction. unless i'm in his killfile this week... 								 mpa

i am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial and repression, and should acknowledge such. the united states, with its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of citizens. this recognition has taken the form of the civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such as 18 usc 241 et. seq., 42 usc 1981 et. seq, et. al. with this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the form of collective guilt, i want people to recognize denial. though it can be said that white people numerically commit more crimes in the united states, because white people are a majority, it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the united states, in their relation to their numbers in population. my views are out of experiences when i was a police officer in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. unless people account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate community, nothing will improve. regards, neal

i am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there are! such arguments are basically worthless, imho. would it really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or even only one? as for death threats, i happen to know from personal experience that gay people are far more likely to receive them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex uals. not a week goes by that i personally or one of my friends is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to be gay. everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under our current form of government in theory, yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments, by the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed and ignorant public. is this democracy? i don't think so. a society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of the treatment of the people who make up that society. all of those people. and yes, that includes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are a part. -- frank jordan [d[d[d[c[c[c gay arab bassoonists unite!!!

numbers, please. that is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. if i decide that a company i am associated with should subscribe to usenet that usenet connection is the property of the company. it is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. for example if a microsoft employee were to post "windows nt is crap don't buy it" from a microsoft machine i would consider it reasonable for microsoft to sack that employee. in the same way if a company decides that it has political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. this is no worse than rupert murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views. |>>i was refering to the arrogance of your position, quoting the words written |>>by slave owners at me in the cause of freedom. |> |>which words written by slave owners did i quote?

candidate clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that was a pretty nifty idea. then president clinton said he wanted families who make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one of the well-to-do. it's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those traditionally liberal enclaves of the bay area and academia where the wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just regular working-class folk". nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class. so who are the rich? well, i'll throw out some stats from the 1990 census and let you be the judge... va negvpyr <mzimmersc5e1qk.fn9@netcom.com> mzimmers@netcom.com (michael zimmers) jevgrf: } in article <1qcdvbinn5ti@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov> } fogarty@sir-c.jpl.nasa.gov (tim fogarty) writes: } > [...] } >that would be about $55 to 65 thousand us, and that is what tenured } >professors can expect to make. for a phd with say 10 years experience, } >$65,000 is a lot less than what he could be making in industry. } } oh? as a 12-year veteran of silicon valley, i've seen precious few } employment ads that call for phds. and $65k is hardly chump change; } it's well above the median *household* income for the state. bay area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range. national average is $31,889. the bay area has nearly twice the national average of six-figure income households (9.1% vs 4.8%*). the cost-of-living here may be high, but i don't think it's twice the national average... } >in los angeles, modest home prices can be $500,000. a 1,500-square-foot tract house in a bay area working-class neighborhood goes for about $250,000. i doubt that the los angeles market is all that different. it would appear that this definition of "modest" is perhaps a bit immoderate... } so what? they're no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed. } } >in california, $65,000 is not upper-middle-class. } } it depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average. it is more than what two-thirds of california households make. seems to me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable definition of "upper-middle-class". note that if that professor's spouse earns $35,000 they become one of clinton's "rich" families. here's a breakdown of national, california, and bay area household incomes: <$30k $30-50k $50-100k $100k+ ------------------------------------ us 49% 24% 23% 4% * the census bureau did some weird ca 41% 26% 26% 7% rounding here...more like 5% ba 34% 25% 31% 9% and to add a little prespective: a minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year. the poverty line for a family of four is $15,171. if they make up to twice that, the government considers them to be "working poor". say we decide to call this the "lower-middle-class". then how 'bout: $30-50k annual income is "middle-class". $50-100k is "upper-middle-class". $100k+ is "rich". $1,000k+ is "filthy-rich". and $10,000+ is "bill gates". make sense? ;^) -timr -- there's nothing surer, the rich get rich and the poor get poorer, in the meantime, in between time, ain't we got fun. --raymond egan

who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary liberal conspiracy- theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist support? this is very typical of the elitist liberal attitude that the people are incapable of thinking for themselves. this elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping america, as the people begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of utopian arrogent socialist jerks. in article 167077 in talk.politics.misc, new liberation news service <nlns@igc.apc.org> writes: >subject: nlns: fascism with a friendly face >lines: 164 >from: new liberation news service <nlns> >subject: nlns: fascism with a friendly face >/* written 8:33 pm apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */ >/* ---------- "nlns packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93" ---------- */ >fascism with a friendly face: does rush limbaugh remind you of >anyone?

[the phrase "with half my >brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental >aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree >with me ... it might take four or five years, but i'm convinced the media >will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking >and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.) you neglect to mention that mr. limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, btw?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included. you yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. he also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). this is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator. i am sure that adolf hitler was a master of satire; i am sure he was just kidding when he said that the jews were the cause of germany's problems and needed to be exterminated. >on religion as the basis of a nation > hitler: "in this world human culture and civilization are >inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan. his dying-off or his >decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without >culture ... he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord >sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the >expulsion from paradise." (page 581.) this is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race. since christ was a jew, it seems quite unlikely that hitler's characterization of the aryan as "the highest image of the lord" fits with christian doctrine. > limbaugh: "america was founded as a judeo-christian country ... >but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or >ambivalent toward religion ... people for whom belief in god is at best a >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools >for the last thirty years. is it only a coincidence that the quality of >american education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.) private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools. american history is indeed primarily judeo- christian. i suppose that mr. limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to adolf hitler worshiping the aryan race. i think you might be reaching just a wee bit here. >on popular culture as a reason for social collapse > hitler: "the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... >one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... >theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the >service of a moral idea of state and culture." (pages 346 and 348.) definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here. > limbaugh: "today, hollywood is in trouble. the reason [is] that >hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... they make fun of people >who believe in god. they ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality >and monagamy. they disparage american heroes." (page 254.) just a guess here, but i don't think that mr. limbaugh would advocate government control of hollywood. you should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this. i believe this is more a criticism of hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control of hollywood. 90's liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control of our school systems, so that the government can teach the people at an early age the "right" way to view religion and morality. i believe mr. limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full of mush" hyperbole indicates. >on the news meida > hitler: "the activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of >gravediggers for the german people and the german reich. one can pass >by in silence the marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of >slavery of international capital and its masters, the jews." (page 331.) pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy. > limbaugh: "elements of the media have jumped on the >bandwagon of leftist causes. the cynical journalist of the past has been >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... during >the gulf war, cnn correspondent bernard shaw [said] cnn is a global >network. we can't take sides. cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... if they don't >realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided >and, may i suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.) indication here that "elements of the media" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias. doesn't sound too unreasonable. no insinuation that cnn should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal. you may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable opinion; and mr. limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters. who is being disingenuous here, mr. shaw or mr. limbaugh? again, you should ask mr. limbaugh himself, but i expect that he would oppose government control of the media. >* * * >to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading. it is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome liberal arrogance. liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them. why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world. > after putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that >haunts me. in the 1920s, adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened >germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed >germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis. in the 1990s, >rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to >depressed and frightened americans; in turn, it is helping the american >radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the >reagan-bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for >the fascist states of america. perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve rush limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the left, not hatred. as to mr. bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. mr. reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business. mr. clinton is increasing fascism in america through "business/government partnership" and increased levels of taxation. perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school. > and if limbaugh is not as repellant a hitler, it is only because the >radical right utilizes limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. one can only >wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook america on. hmmm. seems to me that limbaugh is not in any way comparable to hitler because he has not murdered six million jews and many, many others out of racism. i come from a mixed-race family, so i am quite well attuned to racism; i don't hear any coming from rush limbaugh. the only place i hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the liberal left. the liberal left is the movement i see trying to get america hooked on the opiates of socialized medicine, socialized transportation, socialized education, etc. the left already has america hopelessly addicted to that liberal drug, the social security chain letter. it is quite clear to me that while the hitler analogy does not really apply to either rush limbaugh or william jefferson clinton, if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the fascist clinton. >the madison edge can be reached at po box 845, madison, wi 53701- >0845; (608) 255-4460. > >--- 30 --- this is the same address as "idiots anonymous", isn't it? matt freivald -------------------------------------------------------------------------- liborgalism: thinking is irrelevant. integrity is irrelevant. free speech is irrelevant. private property is irrelevant. personal responsibility is irrelevant. conservativism is futile. you will be assimilated. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- these are my opinions only and not those of my employer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --------------------------------------------------------------------------

the selective service registration should be abolished. to start with, the draft is immoral. whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now, and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior with a volunteer army than with draftees. finally, the government has us on many lists in many computers (the irs, social security admistration and motor vehicle registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to. maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time. let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit. - dave borden borden@m5.harvard.edu

the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15, 1993 press briefing by dee dee myers 	 the briefing room 9:45 a.m. edt 	 	 	 q	 why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? 	 	 	 ms. myers: just due to scheduling conflicts. so as we put out, the president will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the rose garden, as opposed to 10:00 a.m. the only other things on his schedule today are: at 11:00 a.m. he'll meet with general vessey, who, as you know, is on his way to vietnam to continue working on the mia-pow issue. at 12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the vice president in the oval office. and at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the various groups. 	 	 q	 a photo op with vessey? 	 	 ms. myers: there's no coverage on the vessey meeting. 	 	 q	 why? 	 	 ms. myers: why? it's a closed meeting. 	 	 q	 what about the lunch? 	 	 ms. myers: the lunch? no, there's no coverage. 	 	 q	 is he meeting with any congress people today? 	 	 ms. myers: nothing scheduled. 	 	 q	 there are no meetings -- 	 	 ms. myers: there are no congressional meetings today, no. 	 	 q	 has the president been given any information by the pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi? any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject? 	 	 ms. myers: well, clearly, the report is the first order of business. it's high on the agenda on something that they'll discuss. i think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to vietnam today, but the president hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report yet. certainly, it's something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first. 	 	 q	 did the president talk with any republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package? 	 	 ms. myers: he spoke with senator dole. 	 	 q	 how many times? 	 	 ms. myers: i believe once during the day and once last night. 	 	 q	 what was the outcome of that? 	 	 ms. myers: they're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package. 	 	 q	 is it your impression that senator dole is in any way flexible on this? 	 	 ms. myers: well, i think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the senate, and we'll continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement. 	 	 q	 did they discuss the vat tax? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know if that came up. 	 	 q	 can you check that? 	 	 ms. myers: sure. 	 q	 so what are they -- is the president offering to scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down to where dole will sign on? 	 	 ms. myers: well, he's trying to protect as much of it as he can. but it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the senate and through congress now. and as soon as we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know. but at the moment, he's continuing to consult with members of congress including, obviously, senator dole. 	 	 q	 is he talking to anybody else? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday. 	 	 q	 is he talking to anybody today? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't think anything is scheduled, but i wouldn't rule it out. 	 	 q	 we were led to believe that the president called mr. dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package. is that correct? 	 	 ms. myers: i think the president has contacted several people on russian aid. i think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole. the primary objective of the conversation was russian aid. that was the first order of business, but it was both. 	 	 q	 in the president's mind, are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people? has he made that argument? 	 	 ms. myers: i can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made. the president is obviously committed to both. he liked to see a jobs package to the american people first. but as you know, we outlined the details of additional russian aid last night in tokyo. 	 	 q	 but does the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian -- to accept a vote for russian aid? 	 	 ms. myers: i think that the president is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the congress. 	 	 q	 is it fair to say that the president is negotiating now with dole? 	 	 ms. myers: he's discussing options with him. 	 	 q	 on the stimulus, is it your understanding that over the break some democrats, themselves, have left the support that they had earlier for the package, the stimulus package? 	 	 ms. myers: i think we still have wide support in the senate for the jobs package. 	 	 q	 but specifically, that you've lost democrats other than shelby? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so. there hasn't been a vote. 	 	 q	 what about kohl? 	 	 q	 kohl and feingold? 	 	 ms. myers: there hasn't been a vote yet. and we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of the members of the united states senate support the package. 	 	 q	 if you're weren't worried about kohl and feingold, why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day? 	 	 ms. myers: i think george pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't pass. 	 	 q	 no democrats. (laughter.) 	 	 ms. myers: i'll let you draw your own conclusions. 	 	 q	 does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republicans again today? 	 	 ms. myers: there's nothing specifically scheduled, but again, i wouldn't rule it out. 	 	 q	 does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today? 	 	 ms. myers: what we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state. i think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package. 	 	 q	 will you share those with us? 	 	 ms. myers: sure. as we did yesterday. 	 	 q	 do you have copies of the ones you sent -- 	 	 ms. myers: yes, we made those available yesterday. and we certainly can continue to provide them today. 	 	 q	 dee dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the vat, what further consideration of this issue has been given? 	 	 ms. myers: nothing's changed since yesterday. i think the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on, and i don't think we have anything to add to that. 	 	 q	 but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it. can you tell us -- 	 	 ms. myers: i think that there has been -- i'm not going to speculate on who supports it. i think the president said that there has been some support among business and labor groups. i don't think he said he was directly contacted by them. 	 	 q	 are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this -- 	 	 ms. myers: i think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently, but i don't think i want to add to that. 	 	 q	 in february, though, the president said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road. what has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind? 	 	 ms. myers: i think as we said yesterday, it is something that the working groups are looking at. they're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the president's health care plan. the president has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision on it. and beyond that, i don't have anything to add. 	 	 q	 you haven't answered the question. it wasn't being considered by anyone in the white house after the president's comments in february, and george reaffirmed that in a briefing. 	 	 q	 and then suddenly -- 	 	 q	 what happened? 	 ms. myers: the working groups, as we have said throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board. and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax. 	 q	 but the president himself took this off the table, dee dee, and suddenly it reappears. and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way. what has happened in the meantime? 	 ms. myers: the president has not looked at this, it hasn't been presented to him, again, yet. the working groups are looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and no decisions have been made. 	 q	 and it raises the question of how independently the task force is working. 	 ms. myers: the task force was instructed to consider all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all options. 	 q	 but that's not the impression that the president left in february. the impression he left was that this was something that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road. the clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table, not an option. 	 q	 "if it changes i'll tell you." 	 	 q	 bring him on. 	 q	 and you repeatedly referred to the president's remarks, telling us that those were still in operation. 	 	 ms. myers: it's changed, and we told you. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 but that's what alice rivlin's comments and donna shalala comments were about. i mean, that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers -- 	 ms. myers: i wouldn't -- no, alice rivlin's not a cabinet member, first of all. second of all, it was not orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at. we confirmed that yesterday. and i don't have anything to add to that. 	 q	 is it because he has very few options? 	 q	 is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about? in other words, has the president himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table? or is it, in fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with the president? 	 ms. myers: it is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the president of anything. it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options. i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on. 	 q	 they will present it to him as one of his options, though he specifically ruled it out? 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 q	 dee dee, is this more than a trial balloon? is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation? 	 ms. myers: it's simply a statement of fact. the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform. one of the options that they're looking at is the vat. 	 q	 dee dee, when the working groups were examining this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not? 	 ms. myers: i don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is. i don't know. 	 q	 who was telling you that it was not under consideration? 	 ms. myers: i was referring back to the president's comments. 	 q	 have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package? 	 ms. myers: no, there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan. 	 	 q	 i'm asking whether the projections -- 	 	 ms. myers: there's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured. you can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like. and so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know. 	 q	 dee dee, we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages. 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 q	 the question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package. that is not a very difficult computation. 	 ms. myers: it is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being considered. it depends on how the package is structured. the exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made. 	 	 q	 and when the president has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing -- 	 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 	 q	 they have never once said to him, these are your funding options, including the vat? he has never heard the word vat in his -- 	 	 ms. myers: i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular briefings. 	 	 q	 well, you have. 	 	 ms. myers: i have not, other than to say that he's not considered the vat. and i think that is a true statement. 	 	 q	 no, but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option. 	 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 	 q	 that doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it. 	 	 ms. myers: i'm not going to get into the details of what's discussed. i think that statement stands for itself. 	 	 q	 specific, dee dee. when you say he hasn't looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general? because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages are, the whole thing. it sounds like -- 	 	 ms. myers: but that was -- i think in chilicothe, if you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure. and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan. but clearly, it's something that he's thought about in the broad context. i mean, that was clear in chilicothe. what i'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet. it's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options, and that no decisions have been made. and i'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed. 	 	 q	 it's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place. you say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him. 	 	 ms. myers: that is correct. 	 	 q	 do you stand by -- does the white house still stand by george's statement in march that this will not be in the proposal? 	 	 ms. myers: no decisions have been made. we have nothing to add to what's already been said. 	 	 q	 let me follow up here. do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of vat were to be used or considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive? 	 	 ms. myers: i'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if. 	 	 q	 but do you stand by the previous conversations in february that if there were to be a vat, i think the president said you'd exclude food and energy -- 	 	 ms. myers: i'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been made. 	 	 q	 was the president aware prior to donna shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know specifically what -- 	 	 q	 could you check for us, because that's a real important credibility question? 	 	 ms. myers: sure. 	 	 q	 since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money. were you all kept in the dark? was the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a vat tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option? 	 	 ms. myers: i think we've said all that we have to say. it is something the working groups are looking at. the president has not made a decision about it yet. and beyond that, i have nothing to add. 	 	 q	 well, sorry, dee dee, there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily. what we're asking is, if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us. 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever. 	 	 q	 has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out -- 	 	 ms. myers: we're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody. i've said what i have to say about this issue. 	 	 q	 all we were trying to find out -- 	 	 ms. myers: i understand what you're trying to find out and i've given you the answers, helen. 	 	 q	 we're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again. that's the -- 	 	 ms. myers: the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that. 	 	 q	 yes, but it wasn't an option before. how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the table? 	 	 ms. myers: it is something that they're obviously considering and the president has not made a decision on. 	 	 q	 yes, but he took it off the table in february. 	 	 ms. myers: working groups are considering it. they'll present it to the president at some point and he'll make a decision. 	 	 q	 why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table? 	 	 ms. myers: it's clearly on the table. 	 	 q	 yes, but he took it off the table. did he change his mind? 	 	 ms. myers: it's back on the table, bill. 	 	 q	 did he change his mind? 	 	 ms. myers: he said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about it. he obviously knows that it's on the table. it's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you know. 	 	 q	 so he must have changed his mind, right? 	 	 ms. myers: at some point it will be looked at. i mean, -- 	 	 q	 dee dee, there's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the president's. 	 	 ms. myers: the working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options; they've done that. 	 	 q	 are you going to put out his income tax? 	 	 ms. myers: yes, there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon. his return will be available. 	 	 q	 will there be any kind of briefing to go through it? 	 	 ms. myers: no, nothing's planned. i think someone will be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you through the questions. 	 	 q	 we're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms. 	 	 ms. myers: i've seen those briefings. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 could we have one? 	 	 ms. myers: no, i don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it. 	 	 q	 did they file a joint form? 	 	 ms. myers: yes. 	 	 q	 when did he file it? 	 	 ms. myers: i believe it's being filed today. 	 	 q	 dee dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for miyazawa? 	 	 ms. myers: no, there will be a readout after the meeting. 	 	 q	 no backgrounder today? 	 	 ms. myers: no backgrounder today. 	 	 q	 this is complicated stuff. we need help. (laughter.) 	 	 ms. myers: we can't give you taxes and miyazawa all in one day, it's too confusing. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of force in bosnia. they've both said that, a, they never ruled it out, and b, it might be necessary now. does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach? 	 	 ms. myers: there's been no change in our policy towards bosnia. we have always said that we'd consider -- 	 	 q	 but does that impact upon your decision? are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you? 	 	 ms. myers: they're people whose opinions carry weight certainly. i mean, the president supports the process that they've initiated. but there's been no change in our policy for bosnia, although we're considering a number of options right now. if the serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, which we've been saying regularly. 	 	 q	 one follow-up question then? we cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration. why do you not set a deadline for the serbs? can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table? 	 	 ms. myers: we're continuing to put pressure on them every day. 	 	 q	 which doesn't work so -- 	 	 ms. myers: well, we think it is having some effect. we're going to continue to tighten sanctions. as you know, we support the omnibus resolution. we expect that to come to a vote on the 26th. 	 	 q	 you say it's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation? 	 	 ms. myers: i'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that. 	 	 q	 there's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia. serbia, yes; in bosnia, no. 	 	 ms. myers: i think that they've had effect in serbia and we think they've had some effect in bosnia. and again, i'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if you'd like. 	 	 q	 we would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in bosnia. we had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in belgrade, but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting. can you provide something along those lines? 	 	 ms. myers: i will see what i can get you. 	 	 q	 on the extra russian aid that christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from? 	 	 ms. myers: we'll have to work with congress on the details of that package. 	 	 q	 so that would be new money that you would hope to get? 	 	 ms. myers: yes, that's new money, in addition to the $1.6 billion announced in vancouver. so i assume that you all have seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher. 	 	 q	 isn't there a concern, though, about offering something which you have to get in congress? i mean, that was the concern with vancouver; you didn't want to do that. 	 	 ms. myers: the concern with vancouver was to do something immediately, which required money that was already approved in the fiscal '93 budget. what we're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we announced in vancouver. this clearly will require congressional approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to work with congress to make that happen. 	 	 q	 to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by congress? 	 	 ms. myers: the president has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward. 	 	 q	 was christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through congress? 	 	 ms. myers: it was created in consultation with congress. 	 	 q	 in meeting with the law enforcement officials, is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal? a direction? 	 	 ms. myers: yes, the president will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the president's jobs package. they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do. 	 	 q	 who are they? 	 	 ms. myers: it's members or leadership from three organizations: napo, which is the national association of police organizations; ibpo, which is the international brotherhood of police organizations, i believe; and iupa, which is the international union of police associations. 	 	 q	 will the fbi chief be there? 	 	 ms. myers: the fbi chief? no. 	 	 q	 or any other federal law enforcement officials? 	 	 ms. myers: no, it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders. 	 	 q	 does the $1.8 billion announced today include the $400 million that's in the fy '94 budget for disarmament? 	 	 ms. myers: no. the nunn-lugar money is separate. 	 	 q	 so this would be the $700 million that's in the budget already, plus another $1.1 billion? 	 	 ms. myers: i believe all of this is on top of the $700 million already in the budget. 	 	 q	 is this going to be part of the supplemental or fiscal '94 -- 	 	 ms. myers: we'll work with congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for. 	 	 q	 this $1.8 billion on top of -- 	 	 ms. myers: on top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 million nunn-lugar money we announced earlier. 	 	 q	 and this is what prompted the president to call bob dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was calling bob dole? 	 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 	 q	 is there a briefing on miyazawa? 	 	 ms. myers: there will be a readout after the meeting with miyazawa. tomorrow. 	 	 q	 dee dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some republicans who are active in the u.s. chamber of commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce. there are -- the town hall meeting the other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. does the white house feel that you're getting too close to these chambers of commerce? 	 	 ms. myers: that's an interesting charge. (laughter.) after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of being too close. i think that's interesting. but no, we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national chamber and local chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives. 	 	 q	 what's the status of the president thinking about going to this democratic retreat? 	 	 ms. myers: it's on his calendar. i think he'll almost certainly go. 	 	 q	 all three days? 	 	 ms. myers: we haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there yet. 	 	 q	 is it open to coverage? 	 	 ms. myers: no, i believe the whole thing is closed. 	 	 q	 is he going to have any kind of address, statement, anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th? 	 	 ms. myers: we're still looking at that. we haven't made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or what -- 	 	 q	 any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders? 	 	 ms. myers: nothing is scheduled, but i wouldn't rule it out. 	 	 q	 what about an aids czar? 	 	 ms. myers: it's coming. 	 	 q	 anything on the weekend? 	 	 q	 there's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march. 	 	 ms. myers: no, i think this is something he's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the senate democratic retreat. 	 	 q	 the weekend? 	 	 ms. myers: weekend? don't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on saturday. 	 	 q	 any travel plans? 	 	 ms. myers: if it changes -- none right now. 	 	 q	 he's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package? 	 	 ms. myers: no specific plans right now. 	 	 q	 what about mid-week? anything likely? 	 	 ms. myers: it's possible. yes, i think it's likely that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend. 	 	 q	 has he called thurmond about his daughter? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know. i'll check. 	 	 q	 going to name a drug czar this weekend? 	 	 ms. myers: this weekend? i don't believe so. 	 	 q	 and the radio address on saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package? 	 	 ms. myers: i'm sure it will. 	 	 the press: thank you. end10:10 a.m. edt

	 	 the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15, 1993 	 remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations 	 	 the rose garden 2:52 p.m. edt 	 the president: good afternoon. ladies and gentlemen, two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people, their jobs and their economic future. the federal budget plan passed congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country. 	 	 then, the short-term jobs plan i presented to congress, which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago. it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate. 	 	 all of these members of congress know it's time to get the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity. unfortunately, a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill. 	 	 when congress returns, i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake. the issue is not politics, it's people. sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and can't find them. these men and women don't care about who's up or down in washington. they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck. 	 	 they're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward. i am prepared to do that. and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan. i'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs. 	 	 our opponents have been asking for a smaller package. today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people. 	 	 but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller, i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans, and one in particular, and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime. 	 	 so i will ask, even in this reduced package, for an additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession. together, with a matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in communities all across our nation. 	 	 at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make. and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind. 	 	 i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs. make no mistake about it: i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have. i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change. 	 	 i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers. they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package. and i want them to be free to talk about that. they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future. 	 	 i say what i say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities. i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect. it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time. 	 	 these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do. i promised in my campaign that i'd do everything i could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years. this makes a good downpayment on that. this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package. and this will help us to move forward. 	 	 so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill, let's work together. i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets. i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people. i have done my part now to end the gridlock; i ask you to do yours. 	 	 i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people -- beginning with janet reno, the distinguished attorney general. 	 	 * * * * * * * * * * * * 	 	 q	 mr. president, can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue? 	 	 the president: not at all. i think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other. first of all, i made absolutely no decision on that. you should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy. but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax. 	 	 q	 do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care? i mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- 	 	 the president: i'm not going to speculate on that. i will say this: the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost. i mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system. 	 	 the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security. i have no idea. the polls say that, but i don't know. all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned, they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system. 	 	 but i don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have. people want a job first and foremost. they want that more than anything else. 	 	 q	 now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable? i assume summer jobs is one. 	 	 the president: i want the summer jobs; i want the highway program and i want the police program. i still intend -- let me say this: i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill, which did not pass the congress last year. this is a supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way. but i think we need to do that. 	 	 i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids. and there are several other things that i think should be done. we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors; the safety of the public depends on that. 	 	 there are a number of other things that i don't -- i don't think any of it should be cut, but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd -- i talked to them. and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this, and i told him that i would call him back. i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this. and i basically asked them to talk today, and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord. 	 	 so i don't want to be any more specific than i have been already, and let's see if they can talk it out. 	 	 q	 when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 million, that you want that as part of the package? 	 	 the president: i did -- i told senator -- i left word for senator mitchell last night about it. when i talked to senator dole -- i don't remember for sure -- i do not believe i mentioned it. but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock, and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address. and this is certainly consistent with that. 	 	 thank you. end3:12 p.m. edt

from the santa rosa (cal.) press-democrat, april 15, 1993, p. b2: male sex survey: gay activity low a new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough examination of american men's sexual practices published since the kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2 percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual. the figures on homosexuality in the study released wednesday by the alan guttmacher institute are significantly lower than the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional wisdom since it was published in the kinsey report. the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. the median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. compared to the table i have already posted from masters, johnson, and kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population. it's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. -- clayton e. cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer my opinions, all mine! relations between people to be by mutual consent, or not at all.

the following was posted and no doubt retyped by yigal ahrens and considering the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in california, i am reposting to other appropriates groups. from la times, friday, april 9, 1993. p. a1. evidence of adl spy operation seized by police by richard c. paddock, times staff writer san francisco -- police on thursday served search warrants on the anti-defamation league here and in los angeles, seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people. describing the spy operation in great detail, san francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the anti-defamation league searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on arab-american, right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations. representatives of the anti-defamation league, a well-known organization in the u.s. jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-semitism, declined detailed comment thursday but denied breaking any laws. police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including los angeles and san francisco. groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum, including such groups as the ku klux klan, the white aryan resistance, operation rescue, greenpeace, the national assn. for the advancement of colored people, the united farm workers and the jewish defense league. also on the list were mills college, the board of directors of san francisco public television station kqed and the san francisco bay guardian newspaper. people who were subjects of the spy operation included former republican rep. pete mccloskey, jailed political extremist lyndon h. larouche and los angeles times foreign correspondent scott kraft, who is based in south africa. authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies. they also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the south african government. in addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police, the anti-defamation league could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief west coast spy, roy bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant. the anti-defamation league disguised payments to bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $550 a week to beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman, who then paid bullock, according to the documents released in san francisco. hochman, a former president of the jewish federation council of greater los angeles and one of the state's leading tax attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment, his office said. until 1990, hochman, a former u.s. prosecutor, also was a member of a panel appointed by then-sen. pete wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in california. hochman is a former regional president of the anti-defamation league. the league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws. league officials will not confirm or deny whether bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes. but in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for thursday's searches, san francisco police alleged that "adl employees were apparently less than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant. david lehrer, executive director of the los angeles adl office, said the organization has not violated the law. "there is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said. "our record speaks for itself." the police affidavit contends that lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations." lehrer, according to the documents, signed checks from the account under the name l. patterson. an adl official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the anti-defamation league. bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the adl for nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with san francisco police. he said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as "skins" and "pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance. "i might never see or call up on 99% of them again," bullock said. "and it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files. it's not a threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under, say, 'pinko.'" in recent years, bullock worked closely with san francisco police officer tom gerard, who fled to the phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the fbi in the case. a former cia employee, gerard supplied bullock with criminal records and department of motor vehicles information such as home addresses, vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license photographs. using files gathered for the anti-defamation league, gerard and bullock also provided information to the south african government, receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show. the file on times staff writer kraft, which was apparently sold to the south african government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation. the file notes that kraft's articles "appear frequently in the times and are well researched and written," but little else about the file is accurate. the brief entry confuses the times' kraft with another scott kraft and provides the south african government with the wrong kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal information. nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash of target groups. using anti-defamation league funds, he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as "scott" and "scumbag." he worked closely with police officers up and down the coast, exchanged information with the fbi and worked with federal agencies, including the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms. it was bullock's work as a paid informant for the fbi -- while spying on behalf of the anti-defamation league and the south african government -- that proved his undoing. the fbi learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the probe of the anti-defamation league's intelligence network. the anti-defamation league employed undercover operatives to gather information in los angeles, san francisco, new york, washington, chicago, st. louis and atlanta, according to the affidavit and investigators. joining san francisco police in searching league offices and a los angeles bank were investigators from the office of san francisco dist. atty. arlo smith and the state franchise tax board. the los angeles police department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in los angeles but not invited to participate. investigators suspect that some confidential information in the anti-defamation league files may have come from los angeles police officers. from los angeles times, saturday, april 10, 1993. p. a23. adl vows to cooperate with spy investigation by richard c. paddock, times staff writer. san francisco -- the anti-defamation league defended its record as a civil rights group friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups. but san francisco dist. atty. arlo smith said that anti-defamation league employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax violations and conspiracy. police have accused the anti-defamation league of not being truthful about its spying operations, which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum. hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors thursday show that the adl maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures. even so, smith suggested that if the anti-defamation league shut down its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file. in a statement released in washington, national director abraham h. foxman described the adl as "a jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years." foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police, journalists, academics, government officials and the public. it has never been the policy of the adl to obtain information illegally, he said. "like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources, adl will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information," foxman said. the anti-defamation league refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees, roy bullock, was anything more than "a private individual who is alleged to be an adl 'informant.'" among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the adl funneled weekly payments to bullock through beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman. "roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from adl," hochman told a san francisco police investigator. hochman could not be reached friday at his home or office for comment. despite the anti-defamation league's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities, san francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in los angeles and san francisco last fall. a second round of searches thursday, this time with search warrants, produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial transactions, smith said. further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said. "the investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us," the district attorney said. -- yigal arens usc/isi tv made me do it! arens@isi.edu js

	 the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15, 1993 press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room 1:04 p.m. edt 	 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: good afternoon. 	 	 q	 could we do this on the lawn? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that would be nice. let's go out to the cherry blossoms. we'll do like the president. 	 	 q	 is the stimulus package dead? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely not. 	 	 q	 can you tell us more about the dole talks? you said it was a good visit, but no compromise. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. the president had a good talk with senator dole last night. i think that as we said before, there were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well. as you know, the president first called senator dole i believe tuesday night to talk about the russian aid package. they did not speak -- senator dole called him back wednesday morning -- when the president was out. instead he spoke with tony lake, and at the close of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the president about the jobs and stimulus package. they finally talked about that yesterday afternoon. 	 	 at the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night, which they did, when the senator was up in new hampshire. and although there were no specific compromises made on either side, they did say that they would continue to have some discussions. and that's where we are. 	 	 q	 well, who is giving in? where is it standing --are both making concessions? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know that it's at that phase. no compromise has been made. as the president has said consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package. he believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to make those adjustments. 	 	 q	 on the subject of a vat -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, boy. 	 	 q	 can we stay on this for one more minute? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sure. 	 	 q	 we have a problem with the five minutes -- 	 	 q	 i know no decisions have been made, but what would lead the health group to believe that a vat might be necessary? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sorry, andrea, i'm not going to go down that road. no decisions have been made. as the president said this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of congress, a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at. the working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been made. 	 	 q	 to follow, have they done that directly through him? have labor and business groups been in touch with the president about it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not to my knowledge, although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the vat. but the president has not made a decision. 	 	 q	 at the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think that that has been presented for a decision, no. 	 	 q	 not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an option? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, there are a lot of levels of briefing. i do not believe that the vat has been presented to the president as, okay, this is something for you to decide on. 	 	 q	 you're not saying he didn't know it was being considered, though, are you? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, he said it's being considered. 	 	 q	 he knew that. 	 	 q	 but has he discussed that with his advisers? that's what i'm asking. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president has said it's being considered. i do not know what level of discussion there has been over the vat. it is something the working groups are looking at. i don't even know that it's -- 	 	 q	 but he didn't say he was considering, did he, at this stage? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, he is not. i think we're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here. what is considered -- 	 	 q	 well, he is the one who said, i haven't reviewed it. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that is true. that is what i just repeated. 	 	 q	 george, is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in february and the promise that if it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out the way it did, that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think so. i mean, it is now public knowledge that this is being considered. 	 	 q	 is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it come out not from you people, but -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, wait a second. it came out from the administration. what are you talking about? 	 	 q	 what i'm saying is, though, that the president said he would let us know. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: right. 	 	 q	 you people then said -- you said, i believe, that it's not going to be on the program. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: on march 25th. 	 	 q	 on march 25th. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: circumstances change. 	 	 q	 well, i understand. but we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: rooting around -- i know you did do a very good job there to read the usa today article. but this is -- (laughter) -- the deputy director of the omb and the secretary of health and human services. i mean, that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the clinton administration, the headline is -- i'll look at it right here, and ap story -- "clinton wants more money for spying." 	 	 q	 what about his remark that if it were being considered, he'd tell us about it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: and the administration's concerned, and he'd let you know. 	 	 q	 and did he? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. absolutely. what did he say this morning? 	 	 q	 it had to be dragged out of you here yesterday. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it didn't have to be dragged out of me. we had the deputy director of the omb, we had the secretary of health of human services say it was being considered. that is his administration. that is his administration policy. 	 	 q	 were these authorized trial balloons, or were they orchestrated leaks? i mean, what was the -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they were asked questions, they answered the questions. 	 	 q	 you're saying here that it didn't have to be dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely. i was very clear. painfully clear. 	 	 q	 was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, it was just this issue is being considered. they were asked if it was being considered; they answered that it was being considered. 	 	 q	 george, the new york times -- 	 	 q	 why do it yesterday? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they were asked. 	 	 q	 the new york times reports today that secretary reich and the chief economist at the labor department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the president's job stimulus bill, but which turned out to be totally false. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if it was totally false, but i think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the labor department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they say that. 	 	 q	 the question is, is the president concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data? and what's he doing about it, if so? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the chief economist has said that a mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the matter. 	 	 q	 isn't that the same information that goes to the president? 	 	 q	 if i could go back to the stimulus package -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: there's two separate pieces of information. i think that's where the confusion was. 	 	 q	 when did you all first learn about this mistake that was made? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i read the article this morning. 	 	 q	 and as far as you know, is the president aware of it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think so. 	 	 q	 and was he aware of it before he read about it in the new york times? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. not to my knowledge. 	 	 q	 did you ever hear about it before this morning? anything? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i didn't. 	 	 q	 wasn't the president given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose? for his speeches, for his arguments? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well again, i'm not sure. both statements are true. what the labor department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading. they said it was a mistake. they said they wouldn't do it again. 	 	 q	 did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: whenever fewer people are out of work, we're gratified. but that doesn't take away from the need to get this jobs package going. 	 	 q	 if i could go back to the stimulus package for a minute. you said that the president plans to come forward with an amendment. is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on monday and voted on on tuesday, or did he, in the conversation with dole, talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at all. i don't know that they discussed the timing like that. 	 	 q	 do you believe that you're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i believe that we're going to pass a jobs package. the president is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen. i don't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time. i don't know what's going to happen until we have a vote. but the president believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done. 	 	 q	 has there been any indication that this situation has changed? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're going to continue to work on it. we'll know when the votes are taken. 	 	 q	 george, last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go through dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept. this week you're talking to him. is that because you've realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's because senator dole wanted to talk to the president about the stimulus package. 	 	 q	 he initiated the conversation? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 secretary reich this morning said that, in fact, the president is not willing to compromise on this bill at all. you say he's making -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know that that's exactly what he said. i think he said he didn't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, and the president doesn't want to compromise. and the president doesn't want to compromise. but if he has to make adjustments to get it through, he will. 	 	 q	 officials here yesterday said that panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's possible. 	 	 q	 today? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure exactly when that will happen, but i think that it's very possible that we'll come forward with some sort of a different package, or senate democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed. 	 	 q	 as we understood his conversations with dole, the first one was some discussion of this and i'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase is. did he offer him some details or some adjustments? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it's a question of how detailed. i mean, i think they had a general discussion about the package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon. i believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the senate, not necessarily between the president and senator dole. and let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific compromises at this date. when we have something we'll let you know. and i'm not suggesting that senator dole has accepted anything that we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way. 	 	 q	 what are the follow-up discussions if not the president and dole? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think senator mitchell is going to talk to senator dole. 	 	 q	 is that a threat? (laughter.) 	 	 q	 did the president say to senator dole, all right, how about this number as an overall size, or did dole say to the president, i can go as high as this? did they talk numbers? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think it was a negotiation in that respect. it was more of a discussion about their positions. 	 	 q	 did they discuss actual numbers? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm just not sure. i know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages. i think they talked about the programs they cared about. i don't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars. 	 	 q	 does dole have to sign off before there is a package? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, of course not. 	 	 q	 did the white house have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in new hampshire today where senator dole was speaking? was that in any way organized by -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not to my knowledge, no. 	 	 q	 and has the president been in touch with senators kohl or feingold? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think he's talked to them, no. 	 	 q	 george, is the president considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots? and is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves having to pay for the have-nots? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income americans, as he presented in his budget, should go up. and i think for the second half of your question, i'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday. 	 	 q	 george, on the subject of accuracy in information, you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in milwaukee. apparently that is not true. it's actually waste water money. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's waste water money for wisconsin, and some could go to milwaukee. 	 	 q	 but it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money, right? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it would affect the water treatment overall. 	 	 q	 but the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in milwaukee now. would you agree that's not the case? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure of the specifics. i know that it goes to the overall water treatment in wisconsin. 	 	 q	 a leftover question from this morning, which was, when did the president find out that the task force was deliberating on a vat? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not sure exactly when. i just don't know. i assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago. 	 	 q	 so sometime since march 25th? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's right. i don't know the exact date. 	 	 q	 george, the president this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the vat tax. apparently, the national association of manufacturers talks about perhaps the vat tax being okay if it replaces the btu tax. so does the president feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think we've said all we have to say about the vat at this point. i mean, there's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all. the president hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. 	 	 q	 but it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the income tax, for instance? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: there have been no discussions on that. 	 	 q	 in terms of getting a vat tax through congress, senator dole's press release today said vat -- on tax day. do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through congress? would it have a chance? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i have no idea. 	 	 q	 is that a consideration whether you all put it forward? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that would become a consideration if the president were to decide to do it. it's not in consideration now. 	 	 q	 you said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the vat to now be under consideration. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, what the president referred to this morning. these groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered. 	 	 q	 those are the circumstances that have changed? that's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's what he said. 	 	 q	 is that true? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 was there, in fact, some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm not going to get into the deliberations. 	 	 q	 but, george -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. what the consideration is, as the president said, groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider. the working groups are looking at it. 	 	 q	 is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the vat? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it? was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think the groups -- as you know, the health care task force has met with dozens of groups. 	 	 q	 but this is the president's knowledge that these groups had come forward. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups. obviously, there have also been published positions in the newspapers. 	 	 q	 have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if they've briefed him -- i mean, how detailed the briefings have been. i know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups. 	 	 q	 what kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the president would change the position that he had enunciated previously? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know, it's just they've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care. 	 	 q	 the president wasn't aware of those longstanding positions? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he may have been at some level. obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a vat tax. 	 	 q	 what we're trying to figure out here -- you're telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this change in the president's attitude toward the vat between february and now -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president's attitude hasn't necessarily changed. i mean, he has not made a decision. 	 	 q	 i know, but the president said that it was off the table. so did you. and you're saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also describing them as longstanding positions. i don't see the change. if these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been made to the president -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, they've made the presentations to the health care task force. 	 	 q	 there's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in february that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue. 	 	 q	 well, he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he did say that. i don't know that he said anything to refute that. 	 	 q	 but, in fact, has the task force discovered that there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't think that the task force ever suggested that there would. 	 	 q	 george, if he advocated a vat tax, would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i can't comment on a hypothetical situation. 	 	 	 q	 but does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a vat tax? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president has made no decisions on the vat tax. when he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the implications then. 	 	 q	 which specific groups can you cite -- business, labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't have the specific. i just don't have that. 	 	 q	 george, can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking at a wide variety of options. i think that ira magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration. but i'm not going to comment -- 	 	 q	 what's the scope -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm just not going to comment on them, no. 	 	 q	 what's the scope of the need? how much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's what the health care task force is looking at. 	 	 q	 since there's not going to be any briefing on the miyazawa visit, two questions: one, generally what does the president hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his task complicated by the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the vancouver note? 	 	 q	 does no mean yes. 	 	 q	 yes and no. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i don't know. i saw the prime minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question. the questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the prime minister and the president. there is obviously a trade imbalance between japan and the u.s. that we want to do something about. 	 	 q	 also in those comments the prime minister made he suggested that the united states should come down heavy on him in terms of trade. are you going to oblige? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think the president will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly. i don't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the prime minister's comments. 	 	 q	 that we need specific export targets, specific numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with miyazawa? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues. i don't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting. 	 	 q	 why? 	 	 q	 that's the crux of the issue, right? whether or not -- does the president believe that without specific numerical targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president believes that we must have pressure on japan to turn the trade imbalance around. i do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done. 	 	 q	 but does the president believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think, first, the president wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it. 	 	 q	 how about the russian aid package? there seems to be some confusion about how the u.s. views that, secretary christopher saying -- or bentsen saying the japanese may need to do more, the japanese saying that that's not what they heard? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, we're going to continue to work with all our allies in the g-7, and we're going to continue to press for help for russian reform, russian democratic reform. and i think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of tokyo and we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages. 	 	 q	 do you think the japanese need to do more? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can. 	 	 q	 secretary christopher was asked today on the today show this morning what he thought of margaret thatcher's comments on the bosnia policy. and he said, "it's a rather emotional response." 	 mr. stephanopoulos: over an emotional issue. 	 	 q	 right -- to an emotional problem. does the white house condone that kind of remark? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that secretary christopher's remarks speaks for itself. the president believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find answers for. 	 	 q	 but that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- specific term? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, it speaks for itself. 	 	 q	 in connection with that, doesn't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it good american policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help boris yeltsin win a referendum? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: for example? 	 	 q	 to take stronger action, to take military action -- air strikes, anything that can be done? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions. he is also -- as you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo. he believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time. 	 	 q	 what is your response to the critics who would say that the u.s. is now stymied by trying to help boris yeltsin retain the presidency? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they're wrong. we're pressing hard for the serbs to come to the negotiating table. we're pressing hard for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the arms embargo. 	 	 q	 you were putting great store in vance and owen getting people to agree to that. now, vance and owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable. does that change your thinking? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: clearly, we're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say. but at this point, the president is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo. 	 	 q	 a follow-up on a dee dee comment this morning. she said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in bosnia. are you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think that's what she said. 	 	 q	 that's exactly what she said. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think that's true. but what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in bosnia. obviously, if there are connections between the bosnian serbs and the serbs in belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the serbs in belgrade, that will have an effect over time. i do not know day by day, minute by minute, what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been. but, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods into belgrade. we are having an effect on the serbs there. what kind of effect that will eventually have on the bosnian serbs i don't know. but one thing i would say is if it were having no effect at all, i don't know why they'd be fighting it so much. 	 	 q	 are the first lady's tax returns going to be released? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think there's a joint tax return. and it will be probably later today. 	 	 q	 is the president considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think there's any proposal for that at this time, not that i know of. 	 	 q	 it's something that the president promised during the campaign that he would do. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i have not seen any -- i don't think it's anything that's on his plate right now. 	 	 q	 is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know about on this issue. i assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities. 	 	 q	 do you know if that's scheduled -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's probably going to be tomorrow. 	 	 q	 probably going to be tomorrow? (laughter.) 	 	 q	 it's a good thing you asked. 	 	 q	 who's probably going to be there? (laughter.) 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. 	 	 q	 how long -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. that's all i know. 	 	 q	 do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow? (laughter.) 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know what time it is. i don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow. 	 	 q	 environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind. is that going to happen, do you know? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if they've asked, but i think the president has always planned, as he did last year, to give a speech on earth day and i expect that he will. if it's not exactly on earth day, it might be a day before or something like that. 	 	 q	 is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with earth day? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't know the specific timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under discussion and something we've been working on. 	 	 q	 campaign finance reform? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we're working on it. 	 	 q	 do you think it will be next week? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm just not sure. 	 	 q	 the biodiversity treaty is something you're working on? i missed the question. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, something we're working on. he asked if it was ready to be signed, and i said i didn't know anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working on. 	 	 q	 do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't. 	 	 q	 do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he's got to be at the senate meeting in jamestown, and i believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the american association of newspaper publishers in boston on sunday, as he did last year. 	 	 q	 would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: on what? 	 	 q	 on the gays. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: when we went through the president's schedule for the day, certainly. 	 	 q?	 george, what day is the publisher's speech? is that sunday? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it's a sunday. 	 	 q	 and saturday he'll be in jamestown? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 so you're just going to be in jamestown for one day? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, i'm not sure. i don't know how long the senate thing goes. it might go overnight. i just don't know. 	 	 q	 you would have made the gay meeting public, right? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm certain if we had the meeting -- i don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you about it. 	 	 q	 i mean, because it is, as far as i can tell, the first time in history a president has met in the oval office with -- 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i didn't say it was going to be in the oval office. (laughter.) but i didn't -- i'm not say that it's not, but i didn't say that it was. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 at the white house in the bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the white house had to repudiate having done that. so i just wanted to make sure -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, the president wouldn't do anything like that. 	 	 q	 certainly not. 	 	 q	 what marching orders did the president give to general vessey? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: they had a very good discussion for about half an hour today. he wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for american pows and mias. he will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document. the president stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards vietnam. he'll be looking at vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives. 	 	 and ambassador toon also briefed the president on the activities of the joint commission and on the document. 	 	 q	 vietnam says it's a fake. what is the dod analysis at this stage? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it's not completed yet, and it's also the first thing that general vessey will bring up with the vietnamese. 	 	 q	 a number of defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, non-americans that the vietnamese had captured who they referred to as americans from time to time. do people -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we don't have any final determination. we're going to wait for the complete review; when we have it, we'll make a judgment. 	 	 q	 i know you don't have any final determination, but given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that that's a likely possibility? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i just don't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete. 	 	 q	 george, was there a topic scheduled for the speech in boston? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. 	 	 q	 is the president going to have a press conference tomorrow with miyazawa? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think so, but i'm not positive. yes, i expect, yes. 	 	 q	 was toon in with vessey? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 he was in on the meeting? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 what was the question? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: was ambassador toon in with vessey, and the answer is yes. 	 	 q	 do you have any response to the wall street journal report this morning the president's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. well, i do have a response. i think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the president has had restricted access to the press. i would point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than any of his predecessors. i would also point out it also -- 	 	 q	 how many questions? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 occasions. 	 	 q	 how many were while he was jogging? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, no, that's actually a very good question, andrea. and i would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false. he's had 13 press conferences in either the east room, the oval office or the roosevelt room or the briefing room, in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the -- 	 	 q	 oval office press conference -- when was that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he's answered questions in the -- east room. he's had five in the east room, he's had one in the oval office, he's had one in the rose garden, he's had one or two in the roosevelt room. and this is just to the white house, washington press corps. in addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local television anchors. he's met with the editorial board of the portland oregonian. he's had an hour-long interview with dan rather. he's had interviews with local press from california, florida and connecticut -- 	 	 q	 can you address the question of the attitude? the article implies that he doesn't -- 	 	 q	 why doesn't he like us? (laughter.) 	 	 q	 did you really get blamed for that post story? 	 	 q	 the story is that you -- are you held responsible for it. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think i'm going to comment about this. 	 	 q	 are you denying that the president has shown displeasure publicly? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i am not commenting on the discussions between the president and myself. 	 	 q	 did the president write that letter to chris webber? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: what? 	 	 q	 the letter to the university of michigan basketball player? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, yes. 	 	 q	 that is an authentic letter? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 since the president first talked about the vat in february, he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing. does he still hold that position given the impact it could have? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i just can't comment on a proposal he hasn't made. 	 	 q	 george, does the president have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including aids and other issues -- civil rights. 	 	 q	 the military issue? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm certain it will come up. 	 	 q	 is he using this event to name the aids -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think so. 	 	 q	 george, what specifically is the president doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the prime minister miyazawa? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: he's had briefing memos. he's had general discussions with members of the treasury department, the trade representative and others. 	 	 q	 report yet? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if he has the report referred to in the times, but ambassador kantor was here to brief him today. 	 	 q	 he was? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 does he intend to use any of these instances that -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i don't know that the report's been presented. but obviously, the president will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred. 	 	 q	 in terms of the wall street journal, the thrust was that there's a real schism here -- a hostility. do you think he feels that way? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not at all. as i said on the record in the article, i think the president likes reporters. again, i think that the thrust of the article was still misleading. the thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the president may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent history. 	 q	 can we come up to your office? (laughter.) 	 mr. stephanopoulos: if you're invited. 	 	 the press: thank you. end 1:34 p.m. edt 	 #57-04/15 	
the article that follows was taken from the wednesday, april 14, 1993 issue of usa today ("drug use up at younger age" by mike snider, p. 1a). drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders - usually 13 - and they're using more lsd and inhalants like glue and air fresheners, says a new survey. the annual national high school senior survey on drug abuse finds "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, lsd and inhalants. "we may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters adolescence," says lloyd johnston, university of michigan, chief researcher on the study sponsored by the department of health and human services. but drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long decline. the study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the following in the 30 days before they were polled: * 8th-graders - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%; cocaine 0.7%. * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%; cocaine 0.7%. * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%; cocaine 1.3%. among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants declined over the year before. not so with lsd. * 2% of eighth-graders have tried lsd in the last year, up 24% over 1991. * use of lsd among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6% tried it in the last year. reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of strategy" that health secretary donna shalala says will be part of an overall illness prevention plan. the survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders disapprove of them. "it's scary," shalala says. "dealers are focusing on younger, more vulnerable kids." scott kennedy, brewer and patriot before: "david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun..." --atf spokesman after: "[the atf] is a cheap thug who interprets [the constitution] through the barrel of a gun..." --me
the dea and other organizations would have the american people believe that we are winning the "war on drugs". i'm going to dispel the propaganda that the dea is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. to help prove my assertions i've also posted two articles from usa today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise. if wod is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now. the reality is, is that it has not gone down very much. if anything, substance abuse is on the rise. i'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem. the following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled "hello again, mary jane" which appears in the current issue of time magazine (april 19, 1993, p. 59). law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed. "perhaps because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby is out in full force," says robert bonner, head of the drug enforcement administration. "the fact is, they're losing the battle." in 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and bonner says it is still falling. bonner also offers a reminder that studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of nerve cells in the brain and lung damage. the chart that follows was taken from the wednesday, april 14, 1993 issue of usa today ("drug use up among u.s. eigth-graders" by mike snider, p. 6d). adolescents' choices drugs used by eighth graders in the last month: estimated, per 100 students 1991 1992 pct. chg. alcohol 25.1 26.1 +4% cigarettes 14.3 15.5 +8% marijuana 3.2 3.7 +16% amphetamines 2.6 3.3 +27% lsd 0.6 0.9 +50% cocaine 0.5 0.7 +40% crack 0.3 0.5 +67% source: university of michigan institute for social research, 1993 report we are not winning the "war on drugs". i think you can see that one of the tactics that the dea employs to give people the impression that the "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down. the excerpt from time magazine that i included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the dea attempt to deceive the public. usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*. therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" is being lost. perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective. for those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug. agencies like the dea only go after *illegal* drugs. this is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular. the solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. the reason why i think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education). additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime. not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts. imho, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers: make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them. as you already know, people in the u.s. smoke a lot less than they used to. this reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on. i propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out. they are as follows: * drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used. things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in. * all drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels. part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement. * make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of 18). anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent. failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony. * establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible. this agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now. i'm sure that many of the things i've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup. nevertheless, i thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod. go ahead and tear into my post; i'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :) btw, i posted the articles from usa today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on lsd usage among youths--- something which i noticed some posters to this group were interested in. scott kennedy, brewer and patriot before: "david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun..." --atf spokesman after: "[the atf] is a cheap thug who interprets [the constitution] through the barrel of a gun..." --me
the article that follows was taken from the wednesday, april 14, 1993 issue of usa today ("drug use up among u.s. eighth-graders" by mike snider, p. 6d). a new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. for the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results from the national high school survey as signs that the drug war is being won. but this year, officials are retreating - drug use by eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students nationwide. possible reason for the increase: more experimentation. why? if drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist lloyd johnston, one of the survey authors. each new wave of youths "must be given the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs," johnston says. this type of resurgence "is possible," says eileen shiff, author of "experts advise parents" (delta, $14.95). but that's not the issue, she says. the prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now. aggravating the problem: baby boomer parents - who experimented with drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to their children. "i've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to their underage kids and friends, shiff says. for a recent graduation, shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where no booze or drugs were allowed. "we need to fulfill that parental role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says. officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't done anything that i've seen," says suzanne linkous, scottsdale, ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line. linkous, a member of usa today's teen panel, says "there's always going to be experimentation" with drugs. a real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says. but "some don't want to give kids the facts. they think it will give them ideas; it's the same with birth control. i think you should give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes, pamphlets and speakers, she says. education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in kindergarten, says dallas owens, 17, teen panelist from miami shores, fla. "i remember in kindergarten, i used to see (drugs). i think kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds (about using drugs)," he says. scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only one commercial has gotten it right, he says. the commercial opens with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having no prom date. then they take a hit off a joint. "that hits home because it's not attractive," he says. "you can't be doing drugs if you want somebody to like you." adolescents' choices drugs used by eighth graders in the last month: estimated, per 100 students 1991 1992 pct. chg. alcohol 25.1 26.1 +4% cigarettes 14.3 15.5 +8% marijuana 3.2 3.7 +16% amphetamines 2.6 3.3 +27% lsd 0.6 0.9 +50% cocaine 0.5 0.7 +40% crack 0.3 0.5 +67% source: university of michigan institute for social research, 1993 report scott kennedy, brewer and patriot before: "david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun..." --atf spokesman after: "[the atf] is a cheap thug who interprets [the constitution] through the barrel of a gun..." --me

#1 clayton, my man... you are a tad out of touch.... first, gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding nambla from parades etc. #2 nobody from nambla is gonna get a job in a day care centre. the same liberals you are upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare people. #3 tell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the internet? would you be upset ? i`ll bet you would be pissed! to some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad. while your posts offend me i dont think it would be right for you to get fired over it. i dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative action laws of the 60's did. my understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights have. i dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord finds out they are gay. i dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired. do you really think these are justified ? #4 clayton, i am told you are a parent a couple times over. have you been following the strip in the paper "for better or for worse" ? i honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip. do you really care about your childeren as much as friends of mine tell me ? how much do you care about your childeren ? how much do you care about other people's childeren? do you care about my childeren? do you care about my sister's childeren ? if one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home in the middle of the night? would you approve of your childeren driving down to san francisco to trow bottles at and beat up on gay people? would you condone your childeren beating up on someone elses childeren ? i await your answers to these queastions. please no flaming... this is to be a civilised discussion, from one father to another.

fury of mother nature man's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those of nature. in her exceptional book trashing the planet, former atomic energy commision chairman dr. dixie lee ray notes based on the available data, "all of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the industrial revolution do not begin to equal the quantities of toxic materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three volcanoes: krakatoa in indonesia in 1883, mount katmai in alaska in 1912, and hekla in iceland in 1947." to which could be added mount st. helens in washington state in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide alone). el chicon in mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and mount pinatubo in the philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into the stratosphere). los ninos many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the u.s. to global warming, but researchers with the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a natural phenomenon, the interaction of el nino and el nina, two massive currents in the tropical pacific. el nino is a huge strip of warm water that periodically appears off the coast of south america and disrupts the world's weather patterns. now and then, it alternates with el nina, a mass of cold water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for thousands of miles. chicago tribune's peter gorner summarized the phenomenon: "cold water along the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of hawaii. the result was both the u.s. drought and the devastating floods that swamped bangladesh...... nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and distorted the path of the jet stream across north america. then the jet stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the u.s. resulting in drought." termite terror sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental "degradation. time for april 20,1992 noted that in "the netherlands... manure from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. sheep have permanently scarred the landscape in spain and portugal, while in india ... bovines [cows] are ravenous wraiths whose constant quest for food drives them to ravage standing forrests." the february 1983 issue of science digest reported that "an international team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the carbon dioxide that fuel burning does." according to a study reported in science for november 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of carbon dioxide produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion." in addition, "termites are a potentially important source of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global emmisions." the wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere. ants are another natural source of "pollution." in 1987, an atmospheric chemist with bell laboratories, and zoologists from cornell university, reported that ants of the subfamily formicinae make and store huge quantities of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the globe. it is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the rain forests of central africa. according to the july 6, 1987 insight magazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and communicating with each other and upon dying. since 30 percent of the world ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about the acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons annually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation." clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the environment. by robert w. lee. ------ techie@cellar.org (william a bacon) the cellar bbs - (215) 539-3043
the following statement was released on february 27,1992 by the science & environmental policy project as independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are concerned by the agenda for unced, the united nations conference on environment and development, being developed by environmental and activists groups and certain political leaders. this so called "earth summit" is scheduled to convene in brazil in june 1992 and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on the population of the united states and other industrialized nations. such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. they are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. we do not agree. a survey of u.s. atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century. a recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar activity), rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880. futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models. finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food supply. we are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying science. we fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the poor.

[much blathering on the role of military forces in enforcing civil law deleted] the main problem with trying to get the military involved in police work is the differences in the missions. the police take names, try and find out what happened, stop suspects (thats the meaning of 'arrest') and turn them over to the custody of the judicial branch for the adjudication of their case. the military's mission is to kill the enemy before they can escape or surrender. chus pyotr -- pyotr@halcyon.com sometimes pyotr filipivich, sometimes owl. optimist: bagpiper with a beeper.

(to put that in perspective, they cost $177 in japan.) 5. the average us company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on health benefits. seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere else. how can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world? the only thing the usa health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it. and the "private" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society - individuals, government, and industry. of the < 800 billion dollars americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year, the consumer's union estimated that at least 200 billion was thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and procedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world. there are more than 1200 different private insurers in the usa. but did the "private competition" stimulate more efficient paperwork? ask any doctor who's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all! the competition among hospitals is driving costs up, not down. the competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment. spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle isn't my idea of the world's best health care system. competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful. i'm especially thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and cesarean section. sound like the world's best health care system? ever notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care, the libbies start bashing canada's system? first of all, hillary clinton is not advocating another canadian system. i think that's been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months. where did john f. mcmanus get that idea, anyway? let's say you're a canadian living in a small town near the usa border. your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals. the nearest canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an american city one hour south. which way are you going to go? is it because the american system is the "best" in the world, or just for convenience? it still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform. there are a million different ways we ould restructure the system. it's not just a choice between total government control and total private control. i wish the people screaming "socialized medicine" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would inform themselves on health care issues. the current system sucks. i want to keep providers private but that doesn't change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don't reform the health care system. purely private health care without any government intervention doesn't work. hillary clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers. how can you scream "socialized medicine" at her programs? don't you even know what you're talking about? ever see clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade? notice how the line falls, then starts increasing? why? i'll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don't do something about it. peope just doesn't get it. the current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well-being. costs are still rising 10 percent a year even as americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into managed-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask me. a couple of months ago i posted a message asking any hillary-bashers to please come forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how they would set about keeping costs down. i didn't get a single answer. the only thing i keep hearing from libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like "give health care back to the people." just do you expect to do that without serious reforms? what is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help? how can anyone read the news, live under our system, and not see these faults? how can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our infrastrucure, aids, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing away money which could be used to solve those problems? america needs health care reform now. don't just sit there and hillary-bash, inform yourself! jim reynolds -- james p. reynolds (that's jim to you and me.) jpr1@lehigh.edu

a 100% certain way? the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through. this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters. still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis. no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved. the blame does not rest on the fbi, it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular the person who tipped the b-d off in advance has the murder of 4 atf agents and 17 children on his or her conscience. there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security. the fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. the next waco may not be religious nutters but a political movement. a splinter group of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage. the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising. no other government in the world has faced such a situation. this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire. phill hallam-baker

is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in japan? i'm interested in knowing if japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they dealt with it. i've heard, undocumented, that japan years ago used heavy legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem. i'd like to know both sides of the story. does anyone recall such a problem? what were laws at the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking? what are the laws now? what other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment has japan used? how are drugs regarded by the japanese people? how effective have anti-drug measures been in japan? thanks for your help. - david borden borden@m5.harvard.edu

top ten ways slick willie could improve his standing with americans 10. institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of america's health care resources. 9. declare war on serbia. reenact the draft. 8. stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to democtratic constituencies. 7. appoint an unrepetent socialist like mario cuomo to the suprmeme court. 6. focus like a laser beam on gays in the military. 5. put hillary in charge of the ministry of truth and move stephanopoulos over to socialzed health care. 4. balance the budget through confiscatory taxation. 3. remind everyone, again, how despite the democrats holding the presidency, the majority of seats in the house, and in the senate, the republicans have still managed to block his tax-and-spend programs. 2. go back to england and get a refresher course in european socialism. 1. resign, now! copyright (c) edward a. ipser, jr., 1993 be sure to look for: _slick willie's first very own book of top ten lists_ available soon in paperback.

(as some/many libertarians would argue.) on a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile. the libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment. it assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits. this approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, to say the least. i have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through "statist" approaches. with some notable exceptions, however, i do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians. jsh -- steve hendricks | domain: steveh@thor.isc-br.com "one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - r. hofferbert | ma bell: 509 838-8826

janet reno killed the waco children. she is responsible for their deaths. she should resign immediately. she should have understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything against the children if he became provoked. all the warning signs were there and she ignored them. she provoked koresh into killing the children. the situation in waco was similar to a hostage situation with a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person. in such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the hostage. janet reno blindly stumbled in there and basically threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would release the hostage. it's no surprise that the madman would pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation. doug holtsinger

why have >you omitted that level from your model? yes, and the individual is not omitted; i just didn't fully articulate the principles of fractal federalism. all government powers derive from the people; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes that power into the constitution of the level above (in the case of the lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures. we can of course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our constitutional convention :-). once a power has been granted, it may be exercised by the legislature. powers not in the original constitutions must percolate upward, starting from the individual. the ratification process for the original constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority. granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual u.s. government structure). this government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read- "liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on). it is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- "big-government conservatives"). i personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and economic) that is going on now. this is imho a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in. >> 2) a free market works on government, not just economics. succesful >> ideas propogate, unsuccessful ideas die. >what is your definition of a "successful" idea or a "successful" >government? one which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its people, while working within the realities of human nature. you do bring up the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means necessarily a "successful" idea. i believe that fractal federalism would at least bring many ideas to light, and the people would have the opportunity to democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas. if the docialists, er, i mean democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous people, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis. if libertopia is possible, it will arise. if a balanced conservative republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity, it will become clear to the people that it is best. >> as far as "set the moral tone" is concerned, if a community does not >> collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of >> their kids, why should they have to?

i haven't recognized any names from previous discussions, but i do notice that there are a few who blame clinton for the actions of the batf in waco. unless you felt the same way about what we did under bush's *direct* command in panama, it's just partisan whining. which is what i expect most of it to be. i can see no way to condemn one and not the other. but i'm sure some limbot will tell me how killing thousands of panamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than allowing 80 religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched attempt by the batf to serve a search warrant. -- john viveiros (jviv@chevron.com) chevron usa standard disclaimer applies midland tx

(i`m not too sure of their sanity to start with.) i am very suspicious when the government controls all communication, and sends the press 2 miles away. i have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not stand up to scrutiny. i don`t think no-knock warrants are what the constitution writers had in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure. i don`t think an all-powerful central, high-taxing government was what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights to the citizens and states and restricted central government.

(btw, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their few redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;). >also, in the april 14 globe and mail, there was a letter from the >director of trauma services at st. michael's hospital in toronto >responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in >california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that >american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada >rationed vital services. the doctor (i can't recall his name) said >that canada *is* rationing vital services "as any physician can >plainly see". he said that a system in which people are refused >treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system >in which people are refused treatment because the government can't >afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health >insurance plan. in fairness, he did say that both the us and >canadian systems are in the same situation. the only way to hit at the canadian system is transient periods of high demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight fist on the licencing. an obvious difference is that in such a transient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over cabbage patch dolls^tm as we've seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient* situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the california health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing among the insured population. with smaller markets, there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than california (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than canada in a much more dense area). so he is correct in that the resources are fixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either case. as for being "refused treatment" the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen; canadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine. >i know, i know, the monopoly power of canadian doctors often leads >them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more >money from the government (another case of businessmen, once >scratched, becoming socialists). right, as i've pointed out above ... >but hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place >to the other? it hasn't really solved it. either way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of disasters (e.g., chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart disease). a doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship and specialty training. >people too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their >insurance when they really don't need to. that's why i've argued for deductible and copayments rather than education, which is what most canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for (the leftists?

the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist ... since the french and germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then canadians can do the same. as i've pointed out above, the law states that it is illegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for the military and natives. look, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri ... nobody stopped them when they bought it. nobody seems to be stopping them from using it, either. much ado about nothing. thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started ... >while it seemed currently unjustified, there was one anecdote told by >the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri. he showed an >image of an injured knee, which happened to belong to the manager of >the bank who approved the loan. he said that without it, the guy >might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri, then >another length of time for treatment, after which the muscles would >have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder >if that isn't the first whiff of two tiers, i don't know what is. i'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem. i'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit. there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri ... unfortunately, i've had a few. )-; and i'm not a banker.

"one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with, in order to minimize the transactions costs."??? which "one" are you speaking of? _i_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights. besides, coase's theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors. in the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational" from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so. i don't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price. * * * * * >> and then you say: "everyone's property rights were protected; the >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were >> avoided." as above, i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were >> "made whole." they were, in fact, by court action deprived of their >> rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that >> property at a price acceptable to them.

(the camera dei deputati (lower house) will likely remain with proportional representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post) overall, the electoral reform in italy is a welcome change. italians are tired of having crappy government. porn stars, pavarotti's and hunters & fishers won't gain seats because pr is dead. a good two-party system will bring italy efficient, accountable government. it's about time. jeff hagen hagenjd@ac.wfu.edu

'potheads' can grow their own marijuana (as many already do today), other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops. 2. because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users, the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle. if these drugs can be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy them? nevertheless, there will be those who will seek to sell these "noncommercial" drugs even at relatively low prices. therefore, 3. law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell, and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices. but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their victims. 4. upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test. those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be institutionalized until they are clean, and only then will they begin to serve their sentence. if they choose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they can begin to serve their sentence right away. those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences. 5. institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes: drug using criminals (and this includes drunk and/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their sources of supply, thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large, and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business. institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out, before becoming part of the general prison population. while helping protect society from crime, institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals, since drug using criminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up. institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease, with the potential to benefit both themselves and others. 6. dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves, and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations. under this proposal, dealers would be more readily identifiable, since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test, or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them. declining to take the test, they would of course face stiffer penalties. while each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of a suspect's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution. 7. just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, noncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money generated should be used to combat their use. enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however, and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users, since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing prohibition. instead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations, they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed. if drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax. the strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession. revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising campaigns, and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment. 8. taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended. federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated. while my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions, and i believe, would reduce the harm drugs have on our society, particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade. so long as we remain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, and freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always have a drug problem. whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking, the results are the same: needless suffering and death. as a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs, as we are already doing (regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others. we must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users. by taking the profits out of their deadly trade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations. the question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you're talking about. different drugs have different effects, and some are more addictive than others. the addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals, and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot resist the bottle. nicotine, which former surgeon general c. everett koop declared to be as addicting as heroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone, others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer. for those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own, we may argue that because they have chosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on their part, or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life. but for the addicts, while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the time they discover their addiction it is too late. we cannot hold them responsible for their disease, any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim. perhaps they should have known not to go near the water, or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger, but in their present circumstances warnings will not help. neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights. --standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna************************************************************** *(==) ken barnes, lifesci bldg. *

then you have been enslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. we used to be serfs. now we are called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it. most rents in california are enough to buy the apartment house, paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with! i have seen the books! i know what my landlord pays and to whom! i know what i pay her. i am being forced to buy her a building and then i will be let out at the other end with nothing, when i had as much right as her to live on this planet! and her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child. i hope i find out when i am going to die. i can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine. and maybe i can take a few other landlords with me, and their heirs. that would be worth it. then to be able to die before they can do anything to me. that's a poor man's dream. sleep tight, bastard landlords. you don't know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep on my heirs money in your mattress! -rsw -- * richard steven walz rstevew@deeptht.armory.com (408) 429-1200 * * 515 maple street #1 * without safe and free abortion women are * * santa cruz, ca 95060 organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.* * * real men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect women. *

(i went out and bought lots of bell & weinberg this weekend... can you tell?) also, the janus report on sexual behavior (samuel s. janus, ph.d. and cynthia l. janus, m.d., john wiley & sons (pub), 1992) has the following: table 3.14 have you ever had a homosexual experience? men. women. n= 1,335 1,384 yes 22% 17% no 78% 83% table 3.15 how often have you had homosexual contact? men women n= 294 235 a. once 5% 6% b. occasionally 56% 67% c. frequently 13% 6% d. ongoing 26% 21% active (c. + d.) 39% 37% 39% of 22% is 9%. this number is consistent with kinsey, pomery, gebard (1953), bell & weinberg (1967, 1974), and rice (1987) in the finding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with an further breakdown (bell & wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and 5% self-identifying themselves as "bisexuals." (pp 69, 70) as for debunking kinsey, the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read: was kinsey a fake and a pervert? by philip nobile far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal, a hoosier dr. mengele, who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids. but what really riles these critics is kinsey's towerin~ cultural influence. his bestselling surveys-- sexual behavior in the human male (1948) and sexual behavior in the human female (1953)-- tore the sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals. his charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000 men and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations, homosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as american as strawberry shortcake. yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination. judith reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert. in 1983, during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington, reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in "the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children." she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests. now, seven years later, reisman has revived her charges in a different book, titled kinsey, sex and fraud, just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette, louisiana. her coauthor is ed eichel, a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission ("the coital alignment technique") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes. in the book eichel contends that "kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality." if the authors are right, then the world- famous kinsey reports are, as the introduction boldly asserts, "the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century." and if they are wrong, kinsey, sex and fraud is a shameful smear. despite the less- than- stellar credentials of kinsey's detractors, legends are not what they used to be. martin luther king may have committed plagiarism. bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around. father bruce ritter, the founder of covenant house, preyed on runaway boys. closer to kinsey, masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another. so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey, who filmed strange people having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet. the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job. as a thinker, the woman is no madame curie. the 55-year-old former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing, no current university position, and no peer-review publications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom accomplishments. for instance, it listed a book as her own-- take back the night: women on pornography-- that was actually written and edited by others. then there is her ph.d. in speech communication from cleveland's case western reserve university. although reisman has no bachelor's degree, case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate in 1979. her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator. but on the resume, reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker-- to wit: "the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects." when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan's program, it was love at first sight for al regnery, the outwardly anti- porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese's justice department. regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states. after reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthy's wheeling speech, regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests. first he tried to shovel her $800,000 for a quasi-frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs. guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal, but $734,000 in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b- a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy, penthouse, and hust ler. (incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general's pornography commission.) when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986, it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department. that spring, regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house. notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right. as the darling of the sex cranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men's magazines and blames aids on gays. kinsey, sex and fraud is reisman's latest grasp for respectability. pat buchanan, of course, is putting his krugerrands on reisman's ultimate vindication. "this book is social dynamite," he says in a blurb an the front cover. he especially liked the antigay parts. smacking his lips in his syndicated column, he declared, "it may just blow the sewer cap off kinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50 aberration, expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger, and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr. kinsey's 'research.'" the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'accuse is that kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who molested little boys in nazi-type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume/ a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in 1981 to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in 1983. here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey, sex and fraud: mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinsey's conclusions... on childhood sexuality. somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost 15 years. this, of course, would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity. in the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part of kinsey's child sexuality research took place. donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide, eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as reisman said: [kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys, such as y.m.c.a. camp counselor, boys' club leader, and boy scout leader-- activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his marriage." as crude as his analysis seems, eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview. "if you've ever been around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive," he averred. "everything in his life is directed at getting children. i didn't mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey's high school picture was a quote from hamlet: 'man delights me not, no, [sic] nor woman neither.' what do you think they were picking up on?" before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about kinsey's scientific modus operandi. he was a fiendish collector. as a young zoologist with a d.sc. from harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5 million related insects. when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in 1938, he was no less curious or acquisitive. nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him. he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism. naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros, fascinated him. it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins. and so with the fervor of his bughunting days, kinsey collected information about kids, though even his worst enemies-- until reisman and eichel-- refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex. kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: "some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal." although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the documentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold. there was nothing like it in the literature. kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met. this man, whose history took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and grandmother. a sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys. relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved following some boys for as long as 16 years, kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well as the speed and the capacity of climax. what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, kinsey had reported as fact. children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle. "these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy," he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948. then along came judith reisman. ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington. she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker. and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal. well, was he or wasn't he? let's go to the text. there is no evidence in kinsey, sex and fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a trace of hearsay-- that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments. after 12 years on the trail, reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge- - amazingly enough, kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy, kinsey's coauthor on both reports, to whom reisman has never spoken. it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroy's 1972 biography titled dr. kinsey and the institute for sex research. after frisking every "the" and "and" in both books, reisman came up with what she believes are "smoking" sentences. to establish kinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that "there is a hint" in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey "directed" the orgasm studies on kids. she cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that "writers...test their theories...by empirical study and statistical procedures." then she combines this quote with kinsey's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources "were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved." putting two and two together-- kinsey's empiricism and lengthy experimentation-- she arrives at her hint. but realizing this dog would not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement. as for the alleged participation, after poring over pomeroy's biography, reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex. here the chain of reasoning is more complex. she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic. since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming "animal sex"-- reisman asserts that a "similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey's child sex experiments." catch the "may"! reisman was also struck by kinsey's doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: "kinsey, according to pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things for himself. pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit. because he had not personally witnessed this event, kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist. how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of a sex offender?" (but, of course, he did not: he depended on their records.) from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides, sperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey. paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington. reached by telephone, gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reisman's nasty imputations. "i don't understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children," gebhard said more in exasperation than anger. "that is where sex begins. we were happy to take data wherever we found it. even though pedophiles commit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks. they wouldn't be very successful if they were. one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students. as for directing experiments, that's absurd. we never told any of our subjects what to do. lt was against our principles. almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway. nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves. that would have been highly inappropriate." i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation. "i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it." as for kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in confidentiality. he was married to the same woman for 35 years and fathered four children. apparently, there are no huge sexual revelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years. gebhard took his boss's history back in the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows. "we never divulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive," he says. reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years. in keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing "the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest." my offense was using the biblical variant "lying with a near relative" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest. as a synonym for intercourse, "lying with" appears eight times in genesis. ed eichel is a different story. though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations. he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york university's human sexuality program in the early '80s. "it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals," he says. around 1985, eichel came upon reisman's critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm. no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections. eventually, eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman, and from this union kinsey, sex and fraud was born. eichel's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks "the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people" which, by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior, "would open the way for the second and more difficult step-- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children)." when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions, he said weakly, "you don't think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the kinsey reports." meanwhile, eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data. perfect. that's just what the country needs-- a house un-american sexual activities committee, looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer or-- god forbid-- a subject of dr. alfred kinsey. elf !!! -- elf@halcyon.com (elf sternberg) "the purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure pure reasoning, and inhibit clarity. with a little pratice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog!" - bill watterson's calvin.

"i just get laid off, and my divorce became final. but i just wasn't ready for what happened this particular monday." that particular monday was was december 16, the first day of the bill of rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in tulsa that always flew the u.s. flag. when lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news. "'ohmigod, john, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.' i couldn't believe it. then i walked inside. what a nightmare." it was no nightmare; it was horribly real life. apparently acting on information the lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms (batf) teamed up with state and tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "colt, ar-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number." the warrant, issued by u.s. magistrate john leo wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...." reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against lawmaster. they cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process. then, they left. the doors were closed but not latched, much less locked. the ammo and guns were left unsecured. "my front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch. anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything i own. a child could have taken a gun. the guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around. i keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them. while i was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off. they said they were told to shut things down. then i found the note. "nothing found - atf." "they didn't make any attempt to notify me. i've lived in tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket. how come they can't look that up, realize i've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when i'm home? they didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property. they didn't even come by to explain what happened. they just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left." lawmaster placed a phone call to the local batf agent. "i asked, 'are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'no.' i asken him, "who is going to repair and clean up my house?' and he said, "if you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.' "'i can't come down!' i said. 'my doors are broken!' if i had been on vacation and i didn't have friendly neighbors, i would have lost everything i own. here i am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around." lawmaster said the agent advised him, "if you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself." "'oh, i'll come right down, alright,' i told him. 'i'll come down, but i'll bring my attorney.' and he said, 'well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'" so if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make sure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap. > it's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going > to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up > with a charismatic nutcase. what a repulsive outlook on society.

"so what, >90% of everyone else is straight, i'd never end up with a guy anyway." as several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles. nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose. (about half my friends are bi, and that's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a week, it's not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something.) so the available pool for dates can be the same size. unless of course you're trying to date a random sample of the us population. as for promiscuity, i've traded email with clayton on the topic, and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to be more sex. or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up" is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males. (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn't mean they're promiscuous. yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...) -- ____ alan jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu) email, 'talk' always welcome. \bi/ those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- anon \/ b0h7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-ps6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+n0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+
rejoice! the streets of amerika are much safer now that the branch davidians no longer have those nasty assault weapons. your children will no longer lie awake at night wondering when the next brand davidian will attempt to shoot them from their rural compound. men, women, and children have been murdered by our great batf, but the greater good has been secured for all. rejoice! `criminals' who execise the second amendment will be killed.
the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 20, 1993 	 remarks by the president in question and answer session with the press the rose garden 1:36 p.m. edt 	 	 	 the president: on february the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued. 	 	 the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life. the bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, david koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane. 	 he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency. he was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february. given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. 	 	 this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi, designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. 	 	 i was informed of the plan to end the siege. i discussed it with attorney general reno. i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask. i then told her to do what she thought was right, and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. 	 	 yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. mr. koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive. he killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. 	 	 now we must review the past with an eye towards the future. i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently. i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review. finally, i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people. 	 	 i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general, to the justice department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. 	 	 again, i want to say as i did yesterday, i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco. i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks. and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. 	 	 q	 mr. president, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided -- 	 	 q	 mr. president, can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- 	 	 the president: i can't hear you both. if one will go first and then the other. 	 	 q	 sorry. can you describe what janet reno -- 	 	 q	 mr. president -- 	 	 the president: i'll answer both your questions, but i can't do it at once. 	 	 q	 can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? 	 	 the president: yes. i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. and she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building. and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. 	 	 i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire. in fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. there were no shots coming back from the government side. 	 	 i asked a number of questions. the first question i asked is, why now? we have waited seven weeks; why now? the reasons i was given were the following: 	 	 number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. they might be needed in other parts of the country. 	 	 number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out. 	 	 number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time. 	 	 and number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. 	 	 so for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good. she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. 	 	 the third question i asked was, has the military been consulted? as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco, that's the first thing i asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it. and so i asked if the military had been consulted. the attorney general said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. 	 	 having asked those questions and gotten those answers, i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that i would support it. and i stand by that today. 	 	 q	 mr. president -- 	 	 the president: wait. go ahead. 	 	 q	 can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? 	 	 the president: no, i'm bewildered by it. the only reason i made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody. it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. 	 	 there was -- i have -- i can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place. i talked to her yesterday. i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show, and i talked to her again this morning. a president -- it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. 	 	 i will say this, however. i was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves. (applause.) 	 	 i regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. they were heavily armed. they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on. we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life. they made the decision to immolate themselves. and i regret it terribly, and i feel awful about the children. 	 	 but in the end, the last comment i had from janet reno, is when -- and i talked to her on sunday -- i said, now, i want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. and she said, it's because of the children. they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time. i have to take their word for that. so that is where i think things stand. 	 	 q	 can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience? and if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way? 	 	 the president: no -- well, i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today. this is a -- the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time. this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety-split, record time. we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way. is there something else we should have known? is there some other question they should have asked? is there some other question i should have asked? can i say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? i don't know that. that's why i want the inquiry and that's why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. 	 	 there is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. and we may have to confront it again. and i want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved. but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. 	 	 q	 mr. president, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february 28th until yesterday? 	 	 the president: well, yes, i got regular reports all along the way. there were lots of other options pursued. if you go back -- you all covered it very well. the fbi -- you did a very good job of it. i mean, the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working. some of the children got out, some of the other people left. there was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities. and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. 	 	 whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. that's what they thought. 	 	 q	 did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? 	 	 q	 congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? 	 	 the president: that's up to the congress. they can do whatever they want. but i think it's very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts. and as i said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate. there is nothing to hide here. this was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country. 	 	 go ahead, sarah. 	 	 q	 there are two questions i want to ask you. the first is, i think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks. and on february 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? 	 	 the president: they were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the treasury department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them. 	 	 q	 what federal laws -- 	 	 the president: let me go back and answer -- i can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. and one of the things that i've heard -- i don't want to get into the details of this because i don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. 	 	 they also knew, sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent. and they were -- i think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. 	 	 in terms of the gas masks themselves, i learned yesterday -- i did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work. so that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. 	 	 ms. myers: last question. 	 	 q	 mr. president, why are you still saying that -- 	 	 q	 could you tell us whether or not you ever asked janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? and when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? 	 	 the president: what i asked janet reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen. and she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway. and she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future. that was the judgment they made. whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. 	 	 what happened when i saw the fire, when i saw the building burning? i was sick. i felt terrible. and my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. that's the first thing i wanted to know. 	 	 thank you. 	 	 q	 mr. president, why are you still saying it was a janet reno decision? isn't it, in the end, your decision? 	 	 the president: well, what i'm saying is that i didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the fbi. i didn't go over every strategic part of it. it is a decision for which i take responsibility. i'm the president of the united states and i signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call. when i talked to her on sunday, some time had elapsed. she might have made a decision to change her mind. i said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, i will support you. and i do support her. 	 	 she is not ultimately responsible to the american people; i am. but i think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as well as she could have. 	 	 thank you. (applause.) end1:55 p.m. edt
i'd like to conduct a small survey relating to americans' views on economics and on japan. the survey consists of just two questions. i ask that only americans respond; i've posted it worldwide, however, because i think others will be interested in the results. i'll tabulate the results and post them with some commentary. please respond by email to "borden@m5.harvard.edu". here are the questions: 1) as an american, would you prefer that in a given year, a) our economy grows by one percent, and japan's economy also grows by one percent, or b) our economy grows by two percent while japan's economy grows by three percent? 2) on what newsgroup did you read this survey? thank you for your participation. - dave borden borden@m5.harvard.edu

(i've put "good" in quotation >marks because i really don't want to be drawn off into the >side issue of what constitutes a good tenant.) why does this tenant have an "option" (i won't call it a right) to destroy the foa of the landlord? if the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they both can cease from using each other's property. suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have foa. and on what basis does the foa of the landlord "disappear"? it seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice. well, i think foa is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by golly, if the state is going to make it suffer, i sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right. i don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights. >i suspect that the majority of the people in this country >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly >if they are presented in this manner. i don't know if mr. >ronzone or mr. cramer would agree--i suspect not. in any >case, additional problems arise when we try to apply >guidelines for the middle ground. what if the company has 10 >employees, or 100, or 1000? where do we draw the line between >protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting >the right to an equal opportunity? rights are not defined by majority/mob choice. foa is an absolute. reo is a fancy name for thuggery, for racism, and coercion. >the difficulty is that any line we draw will, of necessity, >be artificial. and any legislation resulting will be flawed. >in the past, the government has usually tried to pass laws >which referred to the number of employees hired by the >company--e.g., any company with more than xxx employees was >affected by the law. those with fewer were unaffected. of course it would be. you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial, because foa is the only right. just like a state religion -- you can't jsutify that either. >generally, i believe that if we do not have any regulations >affecting these rights, then the right to freedom of >association will be stronger. on the other hand, many of the >regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too >much, weakening the right to freedom of association. > >i don't believe there is a satisfactory solution which will >please everybody. a solution that i came up with is to use >publicly owned vs. privately owned as the dividing line. if >the company remains privately owned, then the owners should >be free to do whatever they want with their company. if the >company becomes publicly owned, then the public has a right >to ask the company to submit to additional regulation. why? i assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about those quasi-state companys that do not have shareholders. the companies on the fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. they can give you a list of all of their owners. they have no "anonymous", unknown to them, owners. >by the way, the above analysis is based on the assumption >that the right to freedom of association and the right to an >equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal >importance. since this is entirely a matter of faith, not >subject to any "proof", i do not choose to even try to >establish this. you either accept it or you don't. > >any comments? foa can be derived by any two rational people, on a basis that neither has evil, malicious, or murderous intent towards the others. in short, agreement is mutual, or not at all. your reo on the other hand, lives only by accepting coercion, the gun, into the situation. and that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it is based only on might makes right. sort of like saying, "nobody has a right to live", whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument. -- there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of environmental disaster. weird, eh? these opinions are mine, and you can't have 'em!

(keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.) however, i have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis. in fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues. judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office. they do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office. you can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis. not so with economic issues. government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers. just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis. there is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise. but there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient" manner; i call it political market failure. thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to swallow the "whole libertarian agenda." roger collins

a alan brock 4/14/93 orange county register editorial titled "a case for repealing the income tax" got my attention. some quotes: "... a tax on income, because of the flexible definition of that concept, invites the government to snoop into every nook and cranny of our lives. encouraging people to snoop on one another and report transgressions against the almighty state, which most americans deplored in nazi or communist regimes..." "... although most americans paid no income tax at all 50 years ago -- withholding began only during world war ii, as a "temporary" exigency, and in 1948 the median family federal income tax was $9..." "last year the federal government got only 37 percent of its income from income taxes... how long ago was it that the federal government somehow managed to stagger along on 63 percent of its 1992 revenue? ... would you believe five?..."

(i won't necessarily defend him on other issues.) there were never any specific projects included in the community development block grant portion of the president's proposal. congressional republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of potential projects prepared by the us mayors' conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed. (the document in question was designed to pressure the white house to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to congress. it didn't work.) the $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list. if it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level. in the case of spokane, wa., tom foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the republicans' examples) from the funds available in the stimulus package since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for all projects. the plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage. (yup, there are places where that is true.) the swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city. the $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities. if the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds. and that is why the clinton administration has been publicizing the issue. a final point. one may or may not like community block grants. it is worth noting, however, that congressional republicans' opposition to them is new. since the nixon administration, republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than "washington bureaucrats." is it clear now? or is this all too complicated to understand? jsh -- steve hendricks | domain: steveh@thor.isc-br.com "one thing about data, it sure does cut| uucp: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - r. hofferbert | ma bell: 509 838-8826

since 1979, the members of the european parliament (the parliamentary assemby of the european community) have been elected directly by the citizens of the member states. before, the members of the european parliament (meps) were just members of national parliaments (mnps) elected by and from among their peers. in the european parliament, every member state has a fixed number of seats, which increases less than proportionally with the population. once in five years, a general european election is being held, in which the citizens of all member states choose their representatives to the european parliament. next elections are due in 1994. now the voting system for these european elections still differs from one country to another. although the european treaty enabling the direct election of the meps requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections. british meps are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one mep per district; nearly all other states have chosen a system with proportional representation. but then in some countries (france, italy) meps are allowed to be a mnp as well, whilst in others they are not (belgium, netherlands). the european parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to comply with, regardless of the member state (s)he wants to be elected for. i would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions: 1. do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every member state continue to use its own regulations (for european elections that is)? 2. do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or more meps per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional representation (for the whole of the community or per state, per region, per district?). 3. do you think the european commission (or just its president) should be directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the european parliament, or by the joint member state governments as it is now? 4. the maastricht treaty allows subjects of member states to stand for election in another member state they are residing in. do you think you would or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you? 5. do you think meps should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament or a regional parliament too? or a member of a national or regional government body? 6. the european parliament now has meetings in both strasbourg and brussels. meps themselves are for a complete move to brussels in great majority, but political compromises between the governments of the member states stick to the status quo. do you approve of this or do you think the european parliament should meet in one city only, and if yes, which? please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are automatically directed. if you do not have access to that group, please mail your answer directly to me and i will post it for you. i hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter. -- roland siebelink - lokaal b.034 centrum voor de studie van nieuwe vrije universiteit brussel scom/nmit media, informatie en telecommunicatie pleinlaan 2 - 1050 brussel - belgium tel. direkt: +32.2.641 24 15 e-mail <rcsiebel@vnet3.vub.ac.be> tel. centrum: +32.2.641 24 12 talk <rcsiebel@is2.vub.ac.be> fax centrum: +32.2.641 28 61

in a debate about the student government here at our university, a question was raised by one student senator: "why should i represent people who didn't vote?" and by implication, this raises a different question: "why should i represent people who didn't vote for me?" i feel that there are many good reasons that anyone elected to public office (in student government or any other government) should strive to represent all the people in their constituency (class of '95 or a geographical area, or whatever). i would like some help from others in phrasing a reasonable argument on this topic. thanks. followups are directed to talk.politics.misc, but email is preferred. -- jim ault, its systems programmer, rpi, troy, ny 12180 usa aultj@rpi.edu <><

"barter economy" means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose, or to buy it outside the u.s. and bring it in, if it won't grow here. they will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture. they will not, however be able to legally sell their drugs for money. both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed, to discourage their use.

	 the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 20, 1993 press briefing by dee dee myers the briefing room 9:47 a.m. edt 	 	 	 ms. myers: okay, today's schedule. as you know, the president jogged this morning with senator wofford. 	 	 at 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the rose garden to present the teacher of the year award. at 1:30 p.m., he will meet with his principal advisors on bosnia. and at 5:00 p.m., he'll meet with president vaclav havel. there will be a photo op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards. 	 	 any questions? 	 	 q	 is he moving towards some major decision this week on bosnia? 	 	 ms. myers: as we've said, he's continuing to discuss his options. he's been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors, his bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders. he'll try to contact president mitterrand again today, and he'll continue to discuss it. we don't have any specific timetable, but obviously the situation there is very serious. 	 	 q	 has he called janet reno today or yesterday? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe he's spoken to her today. 	 	 q	 why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 p.m.? 	 	 ms. myers: he did. he answered a question about it yesterday. 	 	 q	 before anything had happened. 	 	 ms. myers: before anything happened. he put out -- 	 	 q	 since something has happened he's had nothing to say. 	 	 ms. myers: he's put out a statement on it last night. and we'll have more to say about it later today. 	 	 q	 in what forum is that going to be? 	 	 ms. myers: it will be at the photo in the rose garden. 	 	 q	 he will talk about waco at that? 	 	 ms. myers: yes, he'll have something to say. 	 	 q	 is that something we can take live? 	  	 ms. myers: i think it will be brief. we can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out. but i don't know if it's something you'd want to take live. 	 	 q	 will he take questions on waco at that time as well? 	 	 ms. myers: he'll probably take a few. 	 	 q	 is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the attorney general? 	 	 ms. myers: i'll have to double-check. i don't know that he hasn't talked to her this morning. 	 	 q	 and she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else? 	 	 ms. myers: no. 	 	 q	 and he didn't talk yesterday? 	 	 q	 what's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night? 	 	 ms. myers: she was asked a question about it, and she answered the question. the president has absolutely no intention of asking for the attorney general's resignation. he stands behind her 100 percent. as you know, he was informed about the decision. he takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind attorney general reno. 	 	 q	 the question now arises -- yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing. was he fully informed on all of that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed, et cetera? 	 	 ms. myers: he talked with the attorney general about the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision. he raised no objections. he supports her decision to go forward with it. he was fully briefed. 	 	 q	 of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back now, does the president, does the white house feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened? 	 	 ms. myers: i think everybody feels bad when life is lost. but i don't think that that is reason to second-guess the decision. he stands behind the decision that was made. he was informed about it. he was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 percent behind the attorney general, the justice department and the fbi. it's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone on for more than seven weeks. four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that. 	 	 this was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult. but all the agents on the ground, the fbi, the justice department all recommended moving forward with this. they thought, given the circumstances, it was the best possible course of action. there's just no point in second- guessing those decisions. now, i think that there's a reason -- 	 	 q	 why not? they have to -- 	  	 ms. myers: no, not to second-guess the decisions. i think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation. i think the president will talk some about that later today. but at this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, it's not useful. 	 	 q	 you sound like he's going to order an investigation of what happened and whether -- 	 	 ms. myers: i think he'll have more to say about that later, yes. 	 	 q	 he will order an investigation? 	 	 ms. myers: he'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to say about an investigation. 	 	 q	 what kind of investigation? 	 	 ms. myers: he'll have more to say about it later. 	 	 q	 but in the monday morning quarterbacking, surely there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right decision. you can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather -- a debacle. 	 	 ms. myers: i think we'll -- obviously, we'll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome. i don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic. but, again, the president stands behind the decisions that were made and we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that. 	 	 q	 what was the fbi director's role in this? 	 	 ms. myers: well, he was obviously involved in setting up the operation. he signed off on it, as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him. i don't believe he spoke to the president, but i'll double-check that. 	 	 q	 but he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth? 	 	 ms. myers: i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what aspects he was involved with. 	 	 q	 will janet reno be coming over to the white house today? 	 	 ms. myers: there's no planned meeting. i don't believe that she'll be here. 	 	 q	 she won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.? 	 	 ms. myers: no, no plans to be. 	 	 q	 do you think that there's going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of -- to the president's detriment politically? 	 	 ms. myers: well, i would certainly hope that people wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons. obviously, i think, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate the facts, and i think the president will move forward with that. but i think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents. and i think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent  children lost their lives in this. i don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome. 	 	 q	 dee dee, what was the white house role in handling the, i guess, public relations aspect in the aftermath? who was talking -- who here at the white house was talking with people at justice to set up reno's news conference, to do all that sort of thing? 	 	 ms. myers: i think the attorney general handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information, i think, to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day. obviously, people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the justice department and at the fbi to try to keep informed about what was happening there. 	 	 q	 but reno said that she didn't talk to the president, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to anybody at the white house. so who -- 	 	 ms. myers: there were people talking on a staff-to- staff level. 	 	 q	 i understand. but who at the justice department was handling that for reno? who was talking to the white house? 	 	 ms. myers: there were a number of people. as you know, webb hubbell is the liaison to the white house, and i know he talked to a number of people here. there were a number of people at a number of different levels involved. i don't want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number of conversations. obviously, the justice department was working to keep the white house informed, the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day. 	 	 q	 did webb hubbell talk to the president? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so. i don't know if he talked -- he may have at one point. 	 	 q	 and was the white house role just to seek information about what happened, or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed? 	 	 ms. myers: it was both to keep abreast of the situation so the president could be on top of it, but i think the justice department managed its press relations on it. we were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the president was following it very closely throughout the day. 	 	 q	 dee dee, on that, though, if the president was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with janet reno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then? 	 	 ms. myers: again, i don't know if he's talked to her this morning. again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day. he stands 100 percent behind her decisions. he's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement. 	 	 q	 but wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday? 	 	 ms. myers: one more time, i don't know if they've spoken this morning.  	 	 q	 no, yesterday. 	 	 q	 clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday. 	 	 ms. myers: that's just not true. i think we said throughout the day that the president takes full responsibility, that he stands -- i don't know how much clearer we can be. the president stands foursquare behind the attorney general on this. he accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired. he believes that janet reno, the justice department, and the fbi acted as best they could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time. i don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 1,000 percent. 	 	 q	 one of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her. 	 	 ms. myers: again, i don't know whether they've spoken this morning. 	 	 q	 why can't we find out? 	 	 ms. myers: well, we can. i can't do it standing here right now. 	 	 q	 you've got six people here. all they've got to do is pick up the phone. 	 	 ms. myers: helen, we'll get back to you. 	 	 q	 dee dee, when the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the davidians? 	 	 ms. myers: i think that they discussed the situation. again, i'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him, but i think that he was aware of the risks involved. 	 	 q	 dee dee, the president yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision. she then said that she told him what was happening and he said, okay. does the president regard it that he gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead? 	 	 ms. myers: i think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts. she informed him about that and he raised no objections. again, i don't know how much clearer we can be about that. 	 	 q	 and he said, okay. the issue is over the responsibility. 	 	 ms. myers: he said, okay. 	 	 q	 does okay mean -- 	 ms. myers: the president accepts ultimate responsibility. 	 	 q	 dee dee, the president's investigation that he's going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the administration? 	 	 ms. myers: no. 	  	 q	 it would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation? 	 	 ms. myers: no, it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday. 	 	 q	 and you would, i assume, therefore, cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held? 	 	 ms. myers: to the best of our ability. 	 	 q	 dee dee, there are two reports out this morning. one that the justice department, or fbi, or whomever, apparently had a bug planted inside the complex. and the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire. what do you know about those two -- 	 	 ms. myers: nothing more than i've seen in news accounts this morning. we may get more on it later, but at this point, i know -- i'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound. 	 	 q	 has the president received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've been able to find out on in the compound now? 	 	 ms. myers: he's been briefed. i don't think that they've gotten into the compound yet. they were still waiting for it to cool off. i don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news accounts. but he has been kept up-to-date on it. 	 	 q	 dee dee, the president stands behind attorney general reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so-called experts? 	 	 ms. myers: he believes that she made -- he stands behind the decision that she made. it was the unanimous decision of her advisors, of the fbi, of the agents on the ground, and he supports that. 	 	 q	 what about the validity of the decisions made on the ground? does he back those -- 	 	 ms. myers: he's not going to second-guess decisions made. 	 	 q	 dee dee, you just said, he stands behind the decision which she made. normally, in a situation like this, the president says, i made the decision. but you're saying she made the decision? 	 	 ms. myers: i'm saying that the president was briefed about the decision. he okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it. 	 	 q	 but then why do you keep using the terminology, the decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made -- 	 	 ms. myers: because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by justice department and fbi, which is part of the justice department, and made a decision and then briefed the president on that decision. that is how the chain of command works. she briefed him. he signed off on it. the operation went forward, and the president accepts full responsibility. 	  	 q	 in that chain of command analogy there, i want to go back to sessions a moment. do you know if this was a plan that came through him to reno, or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement? what was his involvement? 	 	 ms. myers: again, you'd have to go to the justice department for the specific interaction between the attorney general and the director. 	 	 q	 does the president stand behind director sessions? 	 	 ms. myers: he supports -- again, i don't know how many different ways i can say this -- he supports the decisions made by the justice department and the fbi. he fully supports the attorney general in this. i'm not stepping away from the director of the fbi, i want to -- but janet reno is the one who briefed him, the one who made the decisions as the head of the justice department. as you know, the director of the fbi reports to the attorney general. the attorney general made the decision. she informed the president about those decisions. he okayed it. he didn't raise any objections to it, and he accepts full responsibility. 	 	 q	 do you have, based on what you know here at the white house, any concerns about william sessions' performance during this -- 	 	 ms. myers: nothing to suggest that, no. 	 	 q	 along those same lines, just in your initial review of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a justice department that's fully staffed and having an fbi director who is still quite uncertain about his status? 	 	 ms. myers: i just don't think that had anything to do with it. i think the agents on the ground -- the operation went forward. i'm not going to speculate on that. 	 	 q	 did the white house express any alarm that janet reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to clinton? 	 	 ms. myers: no. she was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday. i think she did a very admirable job. the president agrees with that. 	 	 q	 before sunday, how often was the president briefed on the situation in waco? 	 	 ms. myers: he was kept updated on a regular basis, on a daily basis. 	 	 q	 who briefed the president? 	 	 ms. myers: well, i'm not going to get into exactly who, what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on the events in waco. he has daily briefings on a number of issues. 	 	 q	 no, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a white house staff person, or was it by a justice department person? 	 	 ms. myers: he's briefed regularly by a white house staff on a number of issues. again, i'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects. 	 	 q	 another subject? 	 	 q	 on another subject. 	  	 	 q	 now we're going to do gays in the military. (laughter.) 	 	 ms. myers: i welcome it. 	 	 q	 how close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty? 	 	 ms. myers: as you know, the president's giving a speech on earth day tomorrow. we'll have more to say about it then. 	 	 q	 any details on where or when that speech is yet? 	 	 ms. myers: it's at 11:30 a.m. and i don't know where yet. 	 	 q	 dee dee, is this a major policy address? how would you characterize the speech tomorrow? 	 	 ms. myers: i would characterize it as a earth day speech. i wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these things. but, again, i don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about tomorrow. 	 	 q	 on or off campus? 	 	 q	 is this at a location outside the white house? 	 	 ms. myers: it will be somewhere in washington. we don't know exactly where yet. 	 	 q	 dee dee, what foreign leaders has the president talked to since friday on the situation in bosnia? 	 	 ms. myers: only prime minister major. and again, he'll try to reach president mitterrand again this morning. 	 	 q	 david owen said yesterday and joe biden said today -- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, that the serbs are not going to sign on. does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on? 	 	 ms. myers: obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnia. as you know, the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point. the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnia is quite serious. and the president will meet with his bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this. 	 	 q	 is that a question they're going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable? 	 	 ms. myers: again, they'll be reviewing a number of options, including the peace plan. 	 	 q	 does the group that he's meeting with today include reg bartholomew? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe he's here. but it will be among the usual -- secretary christopher, secretary aspin, general powell. 	 	 q	 dee dee, do you have anything on the apparent encounter by u.s. f-15s over bosnia today -- some aircraft violating the no-fly zone? 	 	 ms. myers: no, i don't. i'll get back to you on that.  	 	 q	 will the president be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the holocaust museum? 	 	 ms. myers: he will. he'll be meeting, as you know, with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow, and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon. 	 	 q	 as a group, or one by one? 	 	 ms. myers: i believe it's as a group. now, havel and walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time. but he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here. 	 	 q	 dee dee, has the president decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act? and has anything been worked out for him to address the march on sunday? 	 	 ms. myers: i think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march. we haven't worked out the exact details of that. 	 	 q	 not a live phone hook-up? 	 	 ms. myers: probably not, given the logistics of getting to boston. the speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m. the answer to the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on it. 	 	 q	 you said that speech in boston was at 4:00 p.m.? 	 	 ms. myers: i believe so, yes. 	 	 q	 do you know what it's on? 	 	 ms. myers: we'll still working out -- 	 	 q	 general vessey's coming back tonight from vietnam. when will he be meeting with the president? 	 	 ms. myers: no specific meeting is scheduled. we'll talk to him at some point and see. we look forward to his report, but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear. 	 	 q	 so he's not going to come immediately to the white house? 	 	 ms. myers: no. 	 	 q	 the aids czar -- how close are you? 	 	 ms. myers: still working on it. 	 	 q	 drug czar? 	 	 q	 do you expect it before the march? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't have a time line on it. 	 	 q	 did the president ask senator mitchell to try the lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so. 	 	 q	 why not? 	 	 ms. myers: he's just not going to.  	 	 q	 are senate democrats here at this hour? 	 	 ms. myers: no, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. 	 	 q	 update on the stimulus, possible scaling down -- 	 	 ms. myers: as you know, the senate will vote on amendments today. we'll continue to talk. the president is committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed. and we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up. 	 	 q	 when this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the president's talked to janet reno? 	 	 ms. myers: we'll be happy to. 	 	 q	 it's become a pressing question for the last several hours. 	 	 ms. myers: no, just this minute that i've been here, and i haven't had a chance to follow up on it, helen. 	 	 q	 does he have an opinion on hatfield? 	 	 ms. myers: i mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered a compromise package of $12.2 billion. he believes that that's the best alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a second look at the package. and i think the senate will vote on that today, and we're hopeful that the president's bill, which will be the mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved. 	 	 q	 dee dee, is there any white house official that will be at the march on sunday? 	 	 ms. myers: somebody will be there representing the president. i don't know who yet. 	 	 q	 well, has it been decided how he's going to address? is it going to be a videotape or a phone call? 	 	 ms. myers: i think it will probably be a letter, but there hasn't been a final decision on that yet. 	 	 q	 the official will read the letter, is that what it sounds like? 	 	 ms. myers: correct. 	 	 q	 lloyd bentsen came in here this morning. do you know what was that about? was that about this waco thing? 	 	 ms. myers: no, actually it wasn't. it may have come up, but it was about economic issues. 	 	 q	 on health care -- is the 17th of may still the target? 	 	 ms. myers: that's still the target. 	 	 q	 and there's talk about a joint session of congress speech at the end of may -- 	 	 ms. myers: we haven't resolved exactly how the president will present the health care plan to the people. i wouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made. end10:08 a.m. edt

i don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have not included any articles - but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight and point fingers at clinton, reno, the fbi, or whomever. first of all, it is a knee-jerk judgement. the facts are quite muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while. secondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory fingers. pointing fingers is a destructive action. if everyone sat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get done and nothing would ever get any better. and despite the tragedy, we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a constructive manner. doesn't it seem that working together is more productive than working against one another? thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of. why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had - in a very, very difficult situation. some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give me a break. be part of the solution - not the problem. and that's my opinion - david

the white house office of the press secretary ___________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 23, 1993 press briefing by dee dee myers the briefing room 10:35 a.m. edt 	 	 	 ms. myers: at 1:00 p.m., we're having a press conference, bill, in the east room. and then saturday the president will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to jamestown. he will spend the day there, overnight at camp david. 	 	 on sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave camp david and fly to boston. he'll leave from hagerstown. the press plane will leave from washington. 	 	 he will meet with some -- 	 	 q	 what kind of a plane is that he's taking? 	 	 ms. myers: that he's taking? he'll probably take a c- 20. 	 	 q	 from hagerstown? 	 	 ms. myers: from hagerstown. air force one doesn't fly out of hagerstown, apparently. 	 	 q	 how will the pool travel? 	 	 ms. myers: the pool will have to meet him ahead of time. so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport. there is currently no provision -- and i'll double-check, because there's currently no provision -- i think that's standard operating practice. 	 	 q	 the pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so. 	 	 q	 what time does he have to be in boston? 	 	 ms. myers: he's going to meet there with a group of citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at around 1:30 p.m. we're still working out the final times. 	 	 q	 at the airport? 	 	 ms. myers: no, it will be at the boston harbor hotel. 	 and then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called project 21. the speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m. it will be followed by q&a. and then after the speech and q&a, he'll attend a reception with the publishers, and then return to washington from boston. and that's it for the weekend. 	 	 q	 has the president seen the report from -- or the letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, obviously, the communication from madeleine albright? and what is his reaction to their call on him? 	 	 ms. myers: well, obviously, the letter was written to secretary christopher. i believe secretary christopher received the letter on saturday. he reviewed it and met with the authors on monday to discuss their views. he believes it's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the bosnia policy. 	 	 q	 what is the president's reaction? 	 	 ms. myers: the president hasn't seen the letter. it was something that was directed towards secretary christopher. in terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of their concerns generally, what the president has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't there before. and i think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in bosnia. 	 	 q	 is he influenced by that? i mean, how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers -- 	 	 ms. myers: many of the specialists in that area -- i think that that is clearly part of the process. it's something -- their views will clearly be considered. i think secretary christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views. i think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who work closely on the issues. 	 	 q	 what do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before? 	 	 ms. myers: i think the president said last week that there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the bosnian muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being considered. 	 	 q	 dee dee, in terms of those options, madeleine albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the u.s. if the europeans did not go along. is that on the table? 	 	 ms. myers: well, i can't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between ambassador albright and the president. but i think the president has said he would certainly -- is working with our european allies. he's had a number of conversations with european leaders and is trying to build some consensus there. 	 	 q	 will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today? 	 	 ms. myers: no. i mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today. 	 	 q	 does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action? 	 	 ms. myers: he's continuing to consult with our allies at this point. he has said -- i think he's been fairly clear about it, that the he believes that the u.s. needs to act in concert with its allies on this. 	 	 q	 on that point, does he believe that the u.s., though, does have built-in authority from the united nations already to take unilateral action? 	 	 ms. myers: well, i think the u.n. resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort. i think the broader point is that anything we do, any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with u.n. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it. 	 	 q	 dee dee, then how does the white house someone as distinguished as elie wiesel, who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in bosnia? 	 	 ms. myers: i think that that's why we're considering additional options. i think that mr. wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling. the situation in bosnia is tragic. the president is very concerned about it. he has -- i think president clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate serbia in the world community. clearly, we're considering other options because the president is concerned that perhaps it's not enough. 	 	 q	 in terms of what you were just talking about, it sounds like resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the u.s. to protect humanitarian -- 	 	 ms. myers: i don't think it -- i wouldn't use the word justify. it permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief. but i think that's just an explanation of the resolution. i think any action that we take will be consistent with u.n. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action. 	 	 q	 the president and other officials have ruled out unilateral u.s. action in bosnia in the past. you're declining to do that this morning. 	 	 ms. myers: no, i said the president has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. 	 	 q	 that doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly. 	 	 ms. myers: i don't mean to imply a change in policy. the president has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. 	 	 q	 one other little question. did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so. secretary christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it. the president has not seen it. 	 	 q	 they met on monday, right? christopher met -- surely, he must have brought that up -- 	 	 ms. myers: again, they may have talked privately about it, but -- 	 	 q	 dee dee, what you're saying is that the albright recommendation has been rejected, is that correct? 	 	 ms. myers: no, i didn't say that at all. i said i won't -- i said i wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications. 	 	 q	 she's advocating unilateral action and you're saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action. 	 	 ms. myers: i am not confirming anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommended. 	 	 q	 given the sometimes delicate, complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, does the president find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the state department helpful to that process, hurtful to that? 	 	 ms. myers: i think that their views are obviously being considered. the secretary received that memo on saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter. 	 	 q	 doesn't it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do? 	 	 ms. myers: i think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now. and the president and his advisors are considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the state department. now, no decisions have been made on that yet, but i think that there is a through review underway, and that their opinions are being very seriously considered. 	 	 q	 if i can just follow up, i guess what i'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter? did he say, good, this bolsters my position? or did he say, damn, this is just what i don't need right now? 	 	 ms. myers: i think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate. it's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and this, i think in many ways, furthers that goal. 	 	 q	 so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line? 	 	 ms. myers: i think that the fact that secretary christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome. 	 	 q	 does the policy review include what madeleine albright has suggested, and what joe biden and others have suggested, which is that the previous u.n. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- 	 	 ms. myers: i think all options are on the table. 	 	 q	 the unilateral option is on the table? 	 	 ms. myers: i think all options are on the table. 	 	 q	 we've had two different -- 	 	 q	 isn't that a change, dee dee? 	 	 q	 that would be a change of policy. 	 	 q	 particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out. 	 	 ms. myers: i think the president has been -- well, no. i don't -- that is not -- 	 	 q	 are you talking about all options? 	 	 ms. myers: all options -- i think the president has been fairly clear about that. so let me just review again what he has said. he has said that -- the president has said all options are on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground troops, which he has never suggested. he has ruled that out from the beginning. 	 	 q	 hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort? 	 	 ms. myers: he has said that he doesn't believe the u.s. can solve the problems in the former yugoslavia by itself. i think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now. i don't think that -- again, i don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the bosnian muslims, things that i think we've talked about in broad terms. this is a very complicated situation. the options being presented and considered are very complicated. 	 	 q	 air strikes on the table? 	 	 ms. myers: again, i think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being discussed. 	 	 q	 dee dee, are ground troops on the -- 	 	 ms. myers: no, ground troops are not being considered. 	 	 q	 you said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy. then you said everything is on the table. we're confused. are unilateral actions on the table? 	 	 ms. myers: all i can tell you is what the president has said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this. 	 	 q	 wants to, but he's willing to -- i mean, if they don't go along -- 	 	 ms. myers: he's continuing to consult with our allies on this. he's continuing to have discussions. he's continuing to press them for further action. and i think that's clear. the conversation is ongoing. we're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this. 	 	 q	 dee dee, the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnians -- 	 	 ms. myers: i'm not sure that's the consistent -- i mean, i'm not sure who you're referring to. 	 	 q	 the british and the french. 	 	 q	 yes, the british and french. they've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the bosnian military. does the u.s. believe differently from that? 	 	 ms. myers: the president has had conversations with both mitterrand and major, as you know. i think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well. and i don't want to comment on the nature of the president's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action. and i think that process is ongoing. 	 	 q	 the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday. does the president regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action? the allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything. 	 	 ms. myers: the consultations are ongoing. that's all i can tell you at this point. 	 	 q	 are you saying that there won't be any announcement on bosnia today in the press conference? 	 	 ms. myers: no, that is not the intention of the press conference. 	 	 q	 what is the intention? 	 	 ms. myers: it's an opportunity to take questions. he may have a brief -- i'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia. that will not happen. 	 	 q	 can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is? 	 	 ms. myers: it's sort of a general statement of where we are. 	 	 q	 after the first hundred days, you mean? 	 	 ms. myers: it's not a long statement. i mean, this is just generally. don't look for any major policy pronouncements. 	 	 q	 do you know what the opening statement is? 	 	 ms. myers: but it's -- perhaps later today i'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- i think that's still under review. but the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be. it's just to take questions. 	 	 q	 it would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on. 	 	 ms. myers: since the major purpose here is just to take questions, it's not completely resolved yet. 	 	 q	 dee dee, one policy that was expected last week and that the white house, you and george seemed to indicate we might get, would be an aids czar. will he announce that today? and what's the delay on that? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't think we meant to imply -- i think we said it would happen soon. i don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week. it is coming soon. i don't anticipate that happening today. 	 	 q	 what's the delay? isn't this the perfect time to announce an aids czar? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know that it's a delay. i think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement. 	 	 q	 dee dee, what are zoe baird's qualifications for the foreign intelligence advisory board? and why wasn't her appointment announced here? 	 	 ms. myers: the qualifications -- i don't know if there's a specific list; i'll have to check and see. i think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds. many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service. i think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there. we never made a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board, which is admiral william crowe. 	 	 q	 why would he appoint her, though, if the american people and many in the senate rejected her for another government job? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe that the american people ever had -- voted on her. and i certainly -- she was never rejected in the senate. she never went up there for a hearing. but the president believes she's a very competent person. he's said that -- zoe baird -- do you understand what the question is? zoe baird is on the president's foreign intelligence -- 	 	 q	 you said she never went up there for a hearing? 	 	 q	 her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws? 	 	 ms. myers: right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the senate. i was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the senate. 	 	 q	 so you don't think that is any problem? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't think there's any problem. 	 	 q	 she has been appointed to this board, is that a fact? 	 	 ms. myers: yes. 	 	 q	 does she need confirmation for this? does she need confirmation to be a member of the -- 	 	 ms. myers: no. it's a presidential appointment. 	 	 q	 usually, announcements are made here at the white house. was there a decision not to announce her publicly? 	 	 ms. myers: we didn't make an announcement. people who asked were told who the members of the board were. we didn't make an official announcement. if anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names. 	 	 q	 i'd like to know. 	 	 q	 don't such board members -- don't you normally as a matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension? 	 	 ms. myers: not always. but, again, i'm happy to put this out. 	 	 q	 isn't that the standard practice? 	 	 q	 that was past practice. 	 	 ms. myers: again, i'm happy to put it out. we'll put out a list of the members of the board today. 	 	 q	 dee dee, i don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all i really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely? 	 	 ms. myers: i think generally but not always. and we're happy to put that out today. 	 	 q	 what is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board? 	 	 ms. myers: there is roughly a dozen members on the board. it is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president. again, the chairman of that board is admiral william crowe. 	 	 q	 and did he recommend baird? 	 	 q	 what's the name of the board? 	 	 ms. myers: it's the president's foreign intelligence advisory board, pfiab. 	 	 q	 what's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien? is that -- (laughter) -- 	 	 ms. myers: do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke? 	 	 q	 let me phrase it another way. why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago? 	 	 ms. myers: because it's not. 	 	 q	 what's her experience in foreign intelligence? 	 	 ms. myers: she's an experienced attorney, someone who the president believes is very competent and qualified. and i think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input. not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that is not the board's mission. it is to provide civilian input for the president as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters. he believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously talented and has said that throughout. 	 	 q	 is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the president's foreign intelligence advisory board? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't think so. on december 24th, when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed admiral crowe as the head of the board. so i don't believe there's ever been any -- 	 	 q	 earlier than that, during the transition. 	 	 ms. myers: no, i don't believe so. it was announced, again, on december 24th. admiral crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced. 	 	 q	 are members paid? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't believe so, but i'll double-check. 	 	 q	 on another subject, on waco, how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of waco and the state? i guess it's the texas ranger reports. 	 	 ms. myers: most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site. clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the justice department is looking into it. officials in the justice department were told, i believe the day before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet holes. i think there's some discrepancy about that, and the justice department is looking into it. 	 	 q	 is the president going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, but others -- justice, fbi, texas rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute. i mean, i'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it. but as you know, there are several levels of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work together. 	 	 q	 is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't know. i'll have to get back to you on that. 	 	 q	 what is the subject matter of sunday's speech? 	 	 ms. myers: it's going to be fairly general. i don't think it's going to be any specific announcements. i think it's going to be sort of a -- 	 	 q	 does he have a topic that he's going to talk about? 	 	 ms. myers: we're still working on it. but i wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that. 	 	 q	 is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"? (laughter.) 	 	 ms. myers: not exactly, but i think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last -- 	 	 q	 foreign, domestic? 	 	 ms. myers: a little bit of both, but i think a lot of domestic. 	 	 q	 and overview. 	 	 ms. myers: yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement. 	 	 	 q	 has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will address the gay rights march on sunday? 	 	 ms. myers: it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nancy pelosi. 	 	 q	 is that available? 	 	 ms. myers: not yet, but it will be. sure. 	 	 q	 are you going to put it out here or -- 	 	 ms. myers: we'll probably put it out here on sunday. 	 	 q	 travel next week? 	 	 ms. myers: unclear. 	 	 q	 what was the question? 	 	 q	 likely? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't -- 	 	 q	 likely? possible? 	 	 ms. myers: possible. 	 	 q	 what's possible? 	 	 ms. myers: travel. 	 	 q	 george mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week. do you have days yet for them? 	 	 ms. myers: not yet. 	 	 q	 can you tell us which order? 	 	 ms. myers: campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week. 	 	 q	 is there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg? 	 	 ms. myers: no. 	 	 q	 and any report in the aftermath of the day? 	 	 ms. myers: any readout from the day? 	 	 q	 readout. 	 	 ms. myers: it's possible. jeff eller will be down there. i think he can go through what the president did during the day. we don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning. 	 	 q	 dee dee, the president has not made a regular practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to camp david. in fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice? 	 	 ms. myers: twice. 	 	 q	 why this weekend? 	 	 ms. myers: he went two weekends ago, as you know, on the way home from his father-in-law's funeral. i think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family. and this is just an opportunity to do the same. 	 	 q	 there's no march there. 	 	 q	 it has nothing to do with the march here? 	 	 ms. myers: no. 	 	 q	 since he's going to be in town sunday morning now instead of in jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) -- 	 	 ms. myers: he'll fly straight to boston. 	 	 q	 flying straight did you say? (laughter.) 	 	 q	 george took a question yesterday on waco. the president had said on tuesday in the rose garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the fbi. and the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas. do you have an answer on that? 	 	 ms. myers: i don't. i'll check. 	 	 the press: thank you. end10:59 a.m. edt
do we know yet who will be holding the hearings? and, if so, do we know who is on the committee of question askers? i'm sure many of us have potential questions we'd like to send to them. richard

	 the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 23, 1993 	 press conference by the president 	 	 the east room 1:00 p.m. edt 	 	 	 the president: terry, do you have a question? 	 	 q	 mr. president, there's a growing feeling that the western response to bloodshed in bosnia has been woefully inadequate. holocaust survivor elie wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, anything to stop the fighting. is the united states considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against serb artillery sites? 	 	 the president: well, first let me say, as you know, for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action. and i want to say, too, let's look at the last three months. since i became president i have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes investigation, on getting the bosnian muslims involved in the peace process. we have made some progress. and now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution. and leon fuerth, who is the national security advisor to the vice president, is in europe now working on implementing that. that is going to make a big difference to serbia. 	 	 and we are reviewing other options. i think we should act. we should lead -- the united states should lead. we have led for the last three months. we have moved the coalition. and to be fair, our allies in europe have been willing to do their part. and they have troops on the ground there. 	 	 but i do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do i think we will have to. and in the next several days i think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so. i think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it. 	 	 q	 can i follow up? 	 	 the president: sure. 	 	 q	 do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in bosnia and the holocaust? 	 	 the president: i think the holocaust is on a whole different level. i think it is without precedent or peer in human history. on the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the holocaust took to the nth degree. the idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing. and it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together. and i think you have to stand up against it. i think it's wrong. 	 	 we were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region. i was happy to see the violence between the croats and the muslims in bosnia subside this morning, and i think we're making progress on that front. but what's going on with the serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts, both within the former yugoslavia and in other parts of the region. 	 	 q	 mr. president, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency. the tragedy in waco, the defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in bosnia. what did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently? how do you look at things? are you reassessing? (laughter.) 	 	 the president: i don't really believe that the situation in bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but i don't know that the administration could have made it different. 	 	 on the stimulus package, i'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an american government. we have abandoned trickle-down economics. we've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in only a decade. 	 	 the budget plan, which passed the congress, which will reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates. there are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit. that's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very, very good for the country. and so we are moving in the right direction economically. 	 	 i regret that the stimulus did not pass, and i have begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration, but people in the congress whether there is something i could have done differently to pass that. part of the reason it didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas. there are really people still who believe that it's not needed. i just disagree with that. 	 	 i think the recovery -- the economists say it's been underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs. so i think there was an idea base -- an argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward. 	 	 now, i have to tell you, i did misgauge that because a majority of the republican senators now sitting in the senate voted for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan was president in 1983, and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this. i just misgauged it. and i hope that i can learn something. i've just been here 90 days. and, you know, i was a governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get political reform there. so it takes time to change things. but i basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the congress. 	 	 q	 waco -- 	 	 the president: well, with regard to waco i don't have much to add to what i've already said. i think it is a -- i want the situation looked into. i want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that. i think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over. but i still maintain what i said from the beginning, that the offender there was david koresh. and i do not think the united states government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves. and i'm sorry that they killed their children. 	 	 q	 mr. president, to follow up partly on helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill, ross perot said today that you're playing games with the american people in your tax policy. he was strongly critical of your stimulus package. he said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the north american free trade agreement. how are you going to handle his political criticism? will it complicate your efforts on the hill with your economic plan? and do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the hill? 	 	 the president: let me answer that question first. we're going to revisit all of that over the next few days. i'm going to be talking to members of congress and to others to see what we can do about that. with regard to the economic plan, i must say i found that rather amazing. i don't want to get into an argument with mr. perot. i'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but i would -- go back and read his book and his plan. there's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy. but, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar. 	 	 so i think it would be -- i'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear. i'll be glad to hear them. 	 	 q	 to follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his political criticism? he's launched a campaign against you. do you think you can sit back and just -- 	 	 the president: well, first of all, i will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me. and if he's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are. maybe he's got some constructive ideas. 	 	 i think the american people have shown that they're very impatient with people who don't want to produce results. and the one thing i think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- even if they don't agree with what i do -- is that i want to get something done. i just came here to try to change things. i want to do things. and i want to do things that help people's lives. so my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is constructive, that takes us beyond some idea i've proposed that will change people's lives for the better, fine. but i think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the president. 	 q	 mr. president, to go back to bosnia for a minute. you continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis. the united states is the last remaining superpower. why is it not appropriate in this situation for the united states to act unilaterally? 	 the president: well, the united states -- surely you would agree, that the united states, even as the last remaining superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the united nations. 	 q	 but you have a mandate and -- 	 the president: they do, and that is one of the things that we have under review. i haven't ruled out any option for action. i would remind all of you, i have not ruled out any option, except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of american forces into continuing hostilities there. we are not. 	 so we are reviewing other options. but i also would remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the french, the british and the canadians -- have had troops on the ground there. they have been justifiably worried about those. but they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions. they welcomed the american delegation now in europe, working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against serbia. and i can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position, and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been. i don't have any criticism of the british, the french and others about that. 	 	 q	 would that be military action? 	 	 q	 mr. president, several of the leading lights in your administration, ranging from your fbi director to your u.n. ambassador, to your deputy budget director to your health services secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in your administration. why is that? are you losing your political grip? 	 	 the president: give me an example. 	 	 q	 example? judge sessions said that there was no child abuse in waco. madeleine albright has said in this morning's newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in bosnia. all of these are things you said that you didn't support. 	 	 the president: first of all, i don't know what -- we know that david koresh had sex with children. i think that is undisputed, is it not? is it not? does anybody dispute that? where i come from that qualifies as child abuse. and we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves. i think that qualifies as abuse. and i'm not criticizing judge sessions because i don't know exactly what he said. 	 	 in terms of madeleine albright, madeleine albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes. there is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next. and i have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next. and i'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when i make a decision about what to do, then i will announce what i'm going to do. so i wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school. 	 	 q	 how about the value added tax, mr. president? 	 	 the president: what was that? 	 	 q	 the value added tax -- mrs. rivlin and miss shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea. 	 	 the president: i don't mind them saying they think it's a good idea. there are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds. that does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate. no decision has been made on that. and i have no objection to their expressing their views on that. we've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy. i took no -- that wasn't taking a line against an administration policy. 	 	 q	 mr. president, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations. do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations? 	 	 the president: well, i don't know about that. and i don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are. but i'll tell you this: i believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination. i believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it. i believe we need the services of all of our people, and i have said that consistently. and not as a political proposition. the first time this issue came up was in 1991 when i was in boston. i was just asked the question about it. 	 	 and i might add -- it's interesting that i have been attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in america. when i was governor, i was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. i just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of american individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities, and i'm going to stick right with that. 	 	 q	 are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue? 	 	 the president: yes, but i have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it. it's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press. i've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through. and that's what i do. it doesn't take a lot of my time as president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do, and that's what i'll continue to do. 	 	 q	 mr. president, getting back to the situation in bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable. but the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the bosnian muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines. without telling us your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision? 	 	 the president: i'm reluctant to get into this. there are -- those are two of the options. there are some other options that have been considered. all have pluses and minuses; all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the congress, where, i would remind you, heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy. 	 	 i do believe that on the air strike issue, the pronouncements that general powell has made generally about military action, apply there. if you take action, if the united states takes action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met. we must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear. the united states is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war. 	 	 with regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace? will it lead to more bloodshed? what kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy? 	 	 but i think both of them deserve some serious consideration, along with some other options we have. 	 	 q	 do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from vietnam? and now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of agent orange. how can we afford to go to any more of these wars? 	 	 the president: well, i think that's a good argument against the united states itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there. but we are, after all, the world's only super power. we do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia, which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist. 	 q	 did you make any kind of agreement with boris yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the serbs until after sunday? and in general, how has his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia? 	 the president: no, i have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that. we never even discussed that, interestingly enough. the russians, i would remind you, in the middle of president yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the united nations in what i thought was the proper decision for them and one that the united states and, i'm sure, the rest of the free world very much appreciated. 	 q	 do you wish, mr. president, that you'd become more involved in the planning of the waco operation? and how would you handle that situation differently now? 	 the president: i don't think as a practical matter that the president should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail. one of the things that i'm sure will come out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten? and i look forward to that. but at the time, i have to say, as i did before, the first thing i did after the atf agents were killed, once we knew that the fbi was going to go in, was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the conflict given the resources that koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them. and then on the day before the action, i asked the questions of the attorney general which i have reported to you previously, and which at the time i thought were sufficient. i have -- as i said, i'm sure -- i leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions i should have asked. 	 	 q	 mr. president, what is your assessment of director sessions' role in the waco affair? and have you made a decision on his future? and if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide? 	 	 the president: well, first of all, i have no assessment of his role since i had no direct contact with him. and i mean no negative or positive inference. i have no assessment there. i stand by what i said before about my general high regard for the fbi. and i'm waiting for a recommendation from the attorney general about what to do with the direction of the fbi. 	 	 q	 mr. president, since you said that one side in bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the united states cannot take a partisan view in this war? 	 	 the president: well, i said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against. that does not mean that the united states or the united nations can enter a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful. 	 	 i think what the united states has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing. and that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with. this is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face, and that all of our allies face. and if it were easy, i suppose it would have been solved before. we have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done. it has clearly not been enough to stop the serbian aggression, and we are now looking at what else we can do. 	 	 q	 yesterday you specifically criticized the roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets. aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider? 	 	 the president: there may be. i would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different. we were then at war with germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing. but we have -- as i say, we've got all of our options under review. 	 	 q	 the diplomatic initiative on haiti is on the verge of collapse. what can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation? 	 	 the president: well, you may know something i don't. that's not what our people tell me. i think mr. caputo and ambassador pezzullo have done together a good job. the thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there. it's obvious what their concerns are. they were the same concerns that led to the ouster of aristide in the first place, and president aristide, we feel, should be restored to power. we're working toward that. i get a report on that -- we discuss it at least three times a week, and i'm convinced that we're going to prevail there and be successful. 	 	 i do believe that there's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society. but i believe we're going to prevail there. 	 	 q	 mr. president, would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you? (laughter.) 	 	 the president: well, i'll say if -- i believe, first of all, we passed the budget resolution in record time. that was the biggest issue. that confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up. 	 	 we have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. we have lower interest rates across the board. we have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt. 	 	 we have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different. the secretary of education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing opportunity. we have done an enormous amount of work on political reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform. and i have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials. these things are consistent with not only what i said i'd do in the campaign, but with turning the country around. the vice president is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country. 	 	 we are working on a whole range of other things. the welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work. and, of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of americans. 	 	 so i think it is amazing how much has been done. more will be done. we also passed the family leave bill. a version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet. and everything has been passed except the stimulus program. so i think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction. i feel good about it. 	 	 q	 sir, a follow-up. wouldn't you say, though, that one of your biggest initiatives, aid to soviet russia, is now practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own country, how can we do it for them? 	 	 the president: let me recast the question a little bit. it's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be fair we've got to recast it. we have already -- the first round of aid to the soviet -- to non-soviet russia, to a democratic russia, is plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion. the aid that we agreed with our partners in the g-7 to provide through the international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is plainly going to go through. the question is, can we get any more aid for russia that requires a new appropriation by the united states congress? and that is a question i think, mary, that will be resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the american workers and their jobs and their future. i think the two things will be tied by many members of congress. 	 q	 the tailhook report came out this morning, documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the navy. how much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy? 	 the president: first, let me comment a little on that. the inspector general's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services. and i expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way. i also want to say to the american people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined. it should not be taken as a general indictment of the united states navy or of all the fine people who serve there. it is very specific in its allegations, and it will be pursued. 	 the only thing i said to the secretary-designate of the navy and the only thing i should have said to him, i think, is that i expected him to take the report and to do his duty. and i believe he will do that. 	 q	 mr. president, to back to russia for just a minute. the latest poll show that mr. yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence. but there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms. 	 the president: i understand that. 	 q	 can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in order to then build support for russian aid? 	 the president: i believe -- the answer to your question is, for the united states, the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election. if he wins the election, if he is ratified by the russian people to continue as their president, then i think we should do our best to work with him toward reform. 	 	 you know, we had a lot of other countries here for the holocaust museum dedication -- their leaders were here. leaders from eastern europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former soviet union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere. and in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for. you can understand that. 	 	 but if they have confidence in the leadership, i think that's all we can ask. and the united states will -- if the russian people ratify him as their president and stick with him then the united states will continue to work with him. i think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform. i think that we should support that. 	 q	 mr. president, mr. perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- nafta. how hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished? 	 	 the president: i think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future. you know, our people are still working with the mexican government and with the canadians on the side agreements. we're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is. 	 	 the mexicans say, and there is some merit to their position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission. even in the united states, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up. on the other hand, if we're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them. so what we're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be some enforcement. there must be consequences. and we're working out the details of that. 	 	 but i still feel quite good about it. and this is just an area where i disagree with mr. perot and with others. i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the mexican economy and the american economy and leads us from there to chile to other market economies in latin america, and gives us a bigger world in which to trade. i think that's the only way a rich country can grow richer. if you look at what japan and other countries in the pacific are doing to reach out in their own region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area. 	 	 so this is an idea battle. you know, you've got a lot of questions and i want to answer them all, but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for this, somebody else has got to be for that. a lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong about the world toward which we're moving. and the answers are not self-evident. and one of the reasons that i wanted to run for president is i wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way. so i just have a difference of opinion. i believe that the concept of nafta is sound, even though, as you know, i thought that the details needed to be improved. 	 	 q	 mr. president, there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the russian document that purported to show that the vietnamese had held back american prisoners. general vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic, he believes that it was incorrect. do you have a personal view at this point about that issue? and more broadly, do you believe that, in fact, the vietnamese did return all the american prisoners at the time of the paris peace accord? 	 	 the president: first let me say, i saw general vessey before he went to vietnam and after he returned. and i have a high regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way. as to whether the document had any basis in fact, let me say that the government of vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the russian documents claim. 	 	 i do not know whether that is right or wrong. we are having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the evaluation, we'll tell you. and, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were pows. i think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange, but i cannot say that i'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know. there are still some cases that we don't know the answer to. but i do believe we're making some progress. i was encouraged by the last trip. 	 	 q	 i'd like to follow up on that. before the u.s. normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases, the vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith? 	 	 the president: a lot of experts say you can never resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved, going back to the second world war. but what i would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases. and we're not there yet. 	 	 again, i have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this. and i confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment. i just am very influenced by how the families feel. 	 	 q	 your economic stimulus package, are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, the health care initiative and other things? are there any plans to do that? and also, did you underestimate the power of senator bob dole? 	 	 the president: no, what i underestimated was the extent to which what i thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this congress, including the republicans who were in this congress last year -- when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 billion in deficit reduction. when they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, i thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture, and i underestimated that. i did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that. 	 	 i also thought that if i made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed. instead, every time i offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the majority leader about. so it was a strange set of events. but i think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so that a lot of republicans were saying to me privately, "mr. president, i'd like to be for this, but i can't now. and we're all strung out and we're divided." 	 	 and i think we need to do a reality check. as i said, what i want to know -- let me go back to what i said -- what i want to know from our folks and from our friends in the senate on -- and republicans or democrats -- is what could i have done differently to make it come out differently. because the real losers here were not the president and the administration. the real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now. we could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer. i mean, we could have done a lot of good things with that money. and i think that is very, very sad. and it became more political than it should have. but the underlying rationale i don't think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending. that just won't wash. 	 	 q	 and redo -- 	 	 the president: no. i mean, you know, for example --you mentioned the crime bill. i think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill. i mean, the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year. and they were all fighting over the brady bill. surely, surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun. and surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street. 	 	 that's another thing that -- i really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case. i mean people are scared in this country and i think we need to go forward. i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill. 	 	 q	 mr. president, back to the tailhook report for a second. that report contained very strong criticism of the navy's senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior officers. do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this, including admiral kelso who was there one night in las vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers? 	 	 the president: you should know that under the rules of law which apply to this, i am in the chain of command. there is now an inspector general's report and the law must take its course. if i were to answer that question i might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case. i don't really think -- i think all i can tell you is what i have already said. i was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the inspector general's report, and i want appropriate action to be taken. 	 	 until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken, i have been advised that because i am the commander-in-chief i have to be very careful about what i say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con. so i can't say any more except to say that i want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way. 	 	 q	 mr. president, could i ask you for a clarification on bosnia? you said that you were not considering introduction of american forces. does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir? 	 	 the president: i said ground forces. 	 	 q	 you said ground forces. could i ask you, sir, if you fear that using u.s. air strikes might draw the united states into a ground war there? 	 	 the president: i just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore. i've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there. 	 	 q	 with hundreds of thousands of gays in washington this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend? did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities? 	 	 the president: no. 	 	 q	 why not? 	 	 the president: because i -- and, basically, i wouldn't participate in other marches. i think once you become president, on balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should be done. but more importantly, i'm going to the american society of newspaper editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make, to try to focus anew on what i think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now. and i expect that i will say something about the fact that a lot of americans have come here, asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other american citizens if they do that, and just that. and that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will be here, but for others as well. 	 	 thank you very much. end1:48 p.m. edt

	 the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 20, 1993 press briefing by george stephanopoulos 	 the briefing room 12:36 p.m. edt 	 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as you know, the president is going to come out at 1:15 p.m. with your indulgence, i think what we'd like to do is have the president award the national teacher's award first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll make a statement on waco and take a couple questions. so if we can just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably will work out a lot better. 	 	 q	 if you'll give us the time. that's the problem. 	 	 q	 we've got a two-minute warning problem. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, it is a problem. it's about 1:15 p.m. 	 	 q	 the teacher would walk off and then -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's -- i'm just trying to work this out here. i think that's the best way to handle it. 	 	 q	 can i ask you a series of questions about the way the president handled the notifications yesterday? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sure. 	 	 q	 did you, for instance, talk to the justice department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: why don't we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the justice department and the white house. as you know and as we've said, the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday, sunday afternoon. they had a good discussion, about 15 minutes. the attorney general informed the president of what she wanted to do. he raised no objections. obviously, she had the implicit authority from the president to go forward. he raised no objections. she went forward. they had a discussion of a general nature about the incident. 	 	 again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the president spoke with the attorney general again. they had a brief discussion over what was happening in waco. as you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound. and i think that was why there was some -- just some confusion. i think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day when they spoke. 	 	 then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house. they were informing us of  their decisions, what they would like to do. there was an fbi briefing in waco. the attorney general had her press conference. the president then issued a statement after that. 	 	 frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in waco, and i think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground. once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in waco, the president issued a statement. he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday evening. 	 	 q	 at what hour was that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it was quite late. i believe it was after he returned from the holocaust museum. he took a tour of the holocaust museum last night. 	 	 q	 and he went out to dinner. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe briefly. yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night. i don't know the exact time; i think it was relatively late. and he just said, i think as dee dee has reported, that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try and get some sleep. he then, again, spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in waco, and about what they're going to do this afternoon. as you know, the president will have an announcement to make at 1:15. 	 	 q	 did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not to my knowledge, no. 	 	 q	 was webb hubbell the point man for the white house? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: webb hubbell is the general white house liaison and several people talked to webb. the attorney general was running the operation. 	 	 q	 did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job? or he just tell her that she should get some sleep? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think sleep well -- done a good job -- i don't know the exact words. i think that sounds right. 	 	 q	 i mean, sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i mean, i think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when -- 	 	 q	 i understand that, but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that. the spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation yesterday. and that he thought that she had handled it well, as best as she could and -- 	 	 q	 well, does he think it was mishandled?  	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend. 	 	 q	 does he think the situation was mishandled? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president -- 	 	 q	 in retrospect? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the attorney general. he accepts full responsibility. at the same time, i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen again, or at least we know how to handle it. 	 	 q	 how much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with? i know that she made the case to him -- explained -- outlined the case for action. did she say to him on sunday precisely what action? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen. i think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action. i think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered. but it wasn't minute-by-minute detail of how the operation -- 	 	 q	 well, was it, "we are going in." is it, "we're going to use tear gas"? i mean, what? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out. 	 	 q	 george, was there ever a conscious political decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the president from -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not at all. i mean, we were in close contact with the justice department. the president accepts responsibility for this. at the same time -- i mean, we just wanted to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made. it is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations. the attorney general has operational control over this. the president obviously accepts responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the attorney general. 	 	 q	 george, there was a report on the television today -- and i don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the fbi had started the fire and not themselves. there was also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out. and my question is, is the white house absolutely certain that this fire was -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: all the evidence we have is that this fire was started by david koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have. 	 	 q	 did the president ask the attorney general why do this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury?  	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know the specific questions. he had general questions about how the decision was going about being made. 	 	 q	 those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think he asked, have you considered all of the consequences; have you considered the recommendations? i don't know if he asked the question, "why now? " i don't know if he asked that specific question. 	 	 q	 did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about koresh getting increasingly more violent? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i'm not certain how much specific detail they got into. i know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, i mean, the decision she's prepared to make. it's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved. again, i do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that. 	 	 q	 what is the president's understanding why yesterday? one of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action. why yesterday? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: this is the first i've heard. i think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attorney general has said. there were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger. it was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all. 	 	 there was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work. and as the attorney general has said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a concern over the safety. 	 	 all of these factors came into play. they also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on david koresh and those in the compound. i would just go back to what the attorney general has said. you have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time. they did. obviously, we all regret the loss of life. it's a terribly unfortunate situation. we all wish it could have turned out differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were made at the time. 	 	 q	 george, when did the president know that they were going to use tear gas? was it before the assault on the compound? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i just don't know. i don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go. i just don't know. 	 	 q	 along that point, george, can you say whether the plan was presented to the president by the attorney general as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday? 	  	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't presented as tomorrow is d-day, this is it. 	 	 q	 is the president satisfied that, a, he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision, and b, that janet reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: oh, i think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever. 	 	 q	 george, was there a 12-hour gap between conversations between the president and the attorney general? in other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again until clinton got back from dinner at -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that's likely, yes. 	 	 q	 did he call her? what time did she call? was there a gap between when she called him? i mean, was he at dinner when she called and -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, no, no. i think he called her last night. i couldn't swear to it, but i believe he called her last night. he just wanted to talk to her. 	 	 q	 what was going on? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not that i know of, no. 	 	 q	 what do you know about the situation now? everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine? and do you know any of the other details? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know any more details than the fbi reported in waco. 	 	 q	 watching cnn or how was he keeping track of what is going on? if he wasn't talking to his attorney general, how was he keeping track of what was going on here? i mean, with all due respect to cnn, is that how he was doing it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. there was also -- as i said, several people in the white house were in constant contact with their counterparts at justice to have the full and complete information. 	 	 q	 who were those contacts? i mean, was it mack mclarty, webb hubbell? how was the president being kept informed? that's not a -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i believe mack was in contact with webb. i spoke with several people at the justice department. i believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department. either bernie or vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the justice department. we were fully briefed and fully informed. 	 	 q	 we were told this morning that the president may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with webb. do you know if that's true or not? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think there's a chance he may have. i don't believe he did, but i think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point. i don't believe he did. i think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with  the justice department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the attorney general. but the white house was fully informed on a minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in waco and what was happening at the justice department. 	 	 q	 george, who decided that the briefing would be done by the attorney general? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the attorney general. 	 	 q	 did you or did the white house communications staff -- were you ever involved with that decision? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. we were told about it. 	 	 q	 did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil- lehrer and all that stuff? was that part of -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. 	 	 q	 there was no advice from the white house at all about her -- she was on all night, all day. (laughter.) 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes, and she did a very good job. 	 	 q	 why did you decide to have the president's reaction to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally the white house's way of distancing the president from the issue, not having him appear as personally saying anything? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, that wasn't the intent at all. as i said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand. the president is also making a statement today. the president made a statement yesterday morning. the president has been fully involved -- 	 	 q	 after this turned into less than a successful operation, the only statement from the president was what was on paper after the attorney general had already given what amounted to the major facts in this. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, it was the first statement from the president, not the only statement from the president, number one. 	 	 q	 after the -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: number two -- well, the first. number two, the attorney general -- 	 	 q	 he gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: right. and he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today. now, the second point -- 	 	 q	 it just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved? it was the president wants to put out a written statement? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: knowing what we knew at the time, we thought it was appropriate for the president and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the attorney general's -- 	 	 q	 why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something?  	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, he did personally do so. that is his statement. it's a statement under his name. 	 	 q	 george, yesterday during the briefing you didn't say the president took full responsibility for what happened -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i certainly did. 	 	 q	 no, what you said was -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: that's just not right, susan. 	 	 q	 well, i think you can go back to the transcript, i mean, unless i miss something -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'd love to. 	 	 q	 janet reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the fbi -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: and the president takes responsibility. absolutely. 	 	 q	 took responsibility -- all right. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: check the transcript. 	 	 q	 considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why is washington calling this a mass suicide? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of david koresh before and during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his control. 	 	 q	 it's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, george? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that that is an entirely different matter. i mean, i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely. but he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did. 	 	 q	 you're still operating completely on assumption, right? i mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of those inside. 	 	 q	 i didn't quite hear it. this might be ann's question, i didn't quite hear it. but at what time did clinton himself put out a statement on this? i know dee dee said some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m., but the president put out -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: at 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m. 	 	 q	 right after the evening news went on the air? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, right when we had all the information. we were working on it. 	  	 q 	 dee dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the president is going to announce is going to be an administration-run investigation. why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake, particularly those at the atf whose actions have already been -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation. that's not to rule out, as is often in investigations like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well. but it will be run by the treasury and justice. 	 	 q	 are you confident that you will not have any problem getting -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely. 	 	 q	 george, did the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with janet reno? and who else in the white house sat in on that meeting? anyone else from justice? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't believe anybody else was there at the time. it was a phone call on monday, it wasn't a meeting. 	 	 q	 sunday. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: sunday. it was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting. i believe he might have been there with bruce, but beyond that, i think he just talked to the attorney general. 	 	 q	 george, you said that in that phone call, she said that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force him out. what did he think she was talking about? if he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on -- 	 	 qq	 it didn't matter how she did that? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no, no. i mean -- 	 	 q	 what information did he have in terms of how this would proceed? presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute- by-minute, but in a general sense -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies. i just don't know -- 	 	 q	 what is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the recommendation -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the action to increase pressure. i don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure. i just don't know. 	 	 q	 it's hard to imagine him not asking, though. 	 	 q	 that janet reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed? 	  	 mr. stephanopoulos: he was -- he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave. at the same time -- and i would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved. 	 	 q	 george, it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the president was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere. can you take that question and -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely. yes. 	 	 q	 get the answer and come back to us with all of it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a written statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcasts? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: never. never. 	 	 q	 and you never called the justice department and said to anyone or janet reno, "you're the one who needs to be out front explaining this"? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not once. 	 	 q	 it just happened that way that she was the spokesman, that no one ever saw bill sessions until -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: she made a decision as attorney general that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident. 	 	 q	 she had no guidance from the white house at all? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we certainly didn't object. 	 	 q	 but did you -- (laughter) -- no, i'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it? was this a plan -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. absolutely not. 	 	 q	 a strategy? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. 	 	 q	 did she clear it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. 	 	 q	 did she notify you? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: we certainly knew about it. 	 	 q	 what happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the justice department? 	  	 mr. stephanopoulos: the attorney general made the decision and the attorney general wanted to go forward. it seemed like a good decision. it was a good decision. she did a good job. 	 	 q	 let me ask it this way, george, if in hindsight how you would handle it? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it was handled very well. 	 	 q	 you wouldn't change a thing if -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: change what? 	 	 q	 the way the white house handled any part of it -- from start to finish. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i think that's an awful broad question and we're certainly going to have a review. one of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them. if you're talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, there -- wouldn't make any change at all. 	 	 q	 two questions: first of all, on her going on tv, no white house people or outside media consultants came up with this idea? it's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: how so? 	 	 q	 i'm thinking of like watching clinton on nightline after the draft story; watching clinton on -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: there's absolutely no comparison. yesterday there was a law enforcement incident. the incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people. the attorney general was involved in that decision. the attorney general made the decision to do that. she felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she did a fantastic job. 	 	 q	 the second question is, did -- as someone who knows clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do? in other words, she came and she said, i'm going to put pressure on them. it's hard not to see clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how. 	 	 q	 what kind? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: both the attorney general said that he did ask questions, he did ask general questions. i don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation. 	 	 q	 how long a conversation? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think it was about 15 minutes. 	 	 q	 telephone conversation? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 george, was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure -- 	  	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't believe so, no. 	 	 q	 george, you keep saying that the president takes full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision. does the president not accept the fact that as commander-in-chief, it is ultimately his decision? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know what this has to do with commander-in-chief. this was a law enforcement action, not a military action. and he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government. i mean, i think there's just no ambiguity about that. 	 	 q	 but is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision? there's a difference. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: as a matter of fact, it was her decision. he did not object to that decision. he clearly takes full responsibility. 	 	 q	 george, this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged. what exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general? that's a long period of time in a phone conversation. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: it is an awful long phone conversation. it was a very important phone conversation. i think brit has asked that we take the question, and i've said that i would. 	 	 q	 one of the things reno said last night is that the buck stops here. i think that was her direct quotation. does the president agree with that in this case? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: the president says he accepts full responsibility. i think what the attorney general was saying is that she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her. and she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the president. 	 	 q	 at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or this morning, did she ever offer her a resignation? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not to my knowledge. 	 	 q	 even before the fire was out yesterday, there were some republicans on capitol hill calling for an investigation. is the white house at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. and i don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation. we want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation. 	 	 q	 in what forum will you answer brit's question? will you put out a written statement? will you -- the wires? how will you answer the question that you've taken? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'm just not sure. 	 	 q	 george, can you remind us what the president was doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was involved in? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i'll have to try and remember. he had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during  the afternoon. he was certainly monitoring the situation in waco and getting periodic reports on that as well. he did see some on cnn as well. i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing as well. 	 	 q	 and those reports would have come to him from mack mclarty, would they -- do you think? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: mack talked to him, bruce talked to him, i talked to him. 	 	 q	 george, to follow helen's question, in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign? did he say, i don't know why you felt the need to say that? i'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this? did that come up at all? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if it even came up that specifically. i know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation -- 	 	 q	 the didn't talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: well, i believe she was asked a question. 	 	 q	 and her response was, if the president wants me to, i will. 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: which would be, i think, the standard response that most cabinet members would give. i mean, it's a conditional statement. 	 	 q	 have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the president wanted her -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know if they talked about it. i mean, what i learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself. and this just didn't come up. i did not ask the question if they talked about -- 	 	 q	 will you take that with the brit package? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: certainly. (laughter.) 	 	 q	 george, for the record, does the president want her to resign? i know dee dee answered this morning -- 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: absolutely not. he supports janet reno. she's a good attorney general. she's done a good job. she handled a difficult situation extremely well. 	 	 q	 george, does the president feel that he and janet reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: no. and the president is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way. that is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life. everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation. but the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had. 	  	 q	 george, the 15-minute conversation was the one on sunday, is that correct? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: yes. 	 	 q	 how long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i don't know. i'll take that question, too. 	 	 q	 were these outside experts that they were consulting with, or experts within the atf and the fbi? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: you'd have to ask them. i'm just not sure. i know that there were several experts. 	 	 q	 and also, why weren't there replacements for these people? is the unit that small? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: again, i think it is a very small highly-specialized unit. but i think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine. 	 	 q	 george, isn't there a factor here involving the fbi director? normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the attorney general. i know the chain of command. but presidents talk to their fbi directors. in this case, throughout this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill sessions, who is from waco, and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: i think he talked to the fbi director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in waco. at the same time, the attorney general bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the attorney general. 	 	 q	 don't you think the ambiguous situation that director sessions is in has some impact on the way the president is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved? 	 	 mr. stephanopoulos: not at all. i mean, it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the attorney general has supervisory authority over the fbi director, and that's following the chain of command. 	 	 the press: thank you . end 1:03 p.m. edt 	 #60-04/20

the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 20, 1993 remarks by the president during presentation of teacher of the year award 	 the rose garden 1:25 p.m. edt 	 the president: good afternoon. please be seated. i want to say, first, how delighted i am to be here with secretary riley and with senator graham. the three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in american education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving. 	 	 there were no two governors whom i admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the teacher of the year. and i think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom. 	 	 that's why today's ceremony honoring the national teacher of the year is so important. tracey leon bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs. he's developed and introduced into florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and dna fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, i might add, probably only dimly understood here in the nation's capital. (laughter.) 	 	 within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, mr. bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of florida, and it won numerous national and international awards. these advanced programs aren't just for a favored few. tracey bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it. this is what our students need and what our country needs. 	 	 today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime. the basics aren't enough anymore. all our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving. that's why tracey bailey's accomplishments are so important and why i am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments. 	 	 tracey, you represent the best in the united states. i'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this apple award as the teacher of the year for 1993. (applause.) 	 	 mr. bailey: thank you, mr. president. it is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers. and we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools. 	 	 we know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come. and we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education. thank you again. (applause.) 	 the president: in closing, i would like to also welcome the education leaders in florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come. i'd like to recognize tracey's congressman, representative jim bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education. and i'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the national teacher of the year award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of america. they are, in so many ways, our most important public servants. 	 	 thank you very much.

it is interesting, sometimes, to listen to u.s. news as seen through the eyes of another country....... b.b.c. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of london, reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank, when making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene lamp and that is how the fire started. attempts were made by the people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly. has anyone in u.s. heard anything similar or are u.s. government spin-doctors censoring such information? the b.b.c. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died were british citizens.
in a previous article, ddn@cbnews.cb.att.com (david.d.nason) says: >give me a break. give me a break, chum. are you telling me that clinton and reno did not know that the batf actions were illegal, adn in violation of their warrant? >be part of the solution - not the problem. the problem is clinton. you be part of him.

the white house office of the press secretary --------------------------------------------------------------- for immediate release april 23, 1993 background information: advancing u.s. relations with russia and the other new independent states april 23, 1993 at the vancouver summit, president clinton and president yeltsin agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an economic and strategic partnership between the u.s. and russia. since then, president clinton has directed that a number of steps be taken to move this process forward. the administration is announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with russia based on its government's commitment to reform. executive review of cold war laws president clinton and president yeltsin discussed the desirability of reviewing and updating u.s. laws and regulations to reflect the end of the cold war. congress has already acted to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist soviet union has been replaced by a democratic russia and other independent states. however, many laws and regulations remain that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the end of the cold war and that unnecessarily undermine relations with russia and the other new independent states. the president today has ordered an executive review of laws and regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with u.s. security and other national interests, such provisions can be revised or removed. he has asked ambassador-at-large strobe talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis. the president has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible. this review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past. for example, because the russians are eager to have their status changed under the jackson-vanik legislation, president yeltsin personally assured president clinton in vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from russia. by addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds of trust and partnership between the u.s. and russia, and between the u.s. and the other new independent states. review of cocom it is also time to consider expeditiously with america's allies the future of another cold war institution -- the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls (cocom). the united states has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export controls to the post-cold war world, in which russia is no longer viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology. steps to improve the security relationship the president also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of efforts discussed in vancouver that can strengthen u.s. security and improve our security relationship with the russians and the other states. accelerated deactivation of nuclear weapons in vancouver, the two presidents discussed accelerating the process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for elimination under the start i treaty. president clinton has directed the department of defense to complete this process well in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in start i. in addition, the united states, together with russia and the other relevant states of the former soviet union, will be exploring programs under nunn-lugar to help them to accelerate this process. multilateral test ban the two presidents agreed at vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, and that the two governments would consult with each other accordingly. the united states looks forward to beginning consultations with russia, our allies, and other states, on the specific issues related to this negotiation. the united states expects to start this consultative process within the next two months. detargeting the two presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear targeting at vancouver. as the united states and russia move into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the past to safeguard u.s. security against a nuclear adversary. the administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures that could enhance strategic stability, including recent proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles. other measures to create a new security relationship in response to the incident involving a collision between us and russian submarines last month, secretary aspin will be ready to discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with russian defense minister grachev during his visit to the united states in late may. secretary aspin will also be prepared to move forward with defense minister grachev in may to develop a combined training program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the un security council. the united states looks forward to broadening such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations. the us and russia are working together to convene a may ministerial meeting of the un security council to discuss proposals for enhancing the un's peacekeeping capability and to move consideration of the secretary-general's agenda for peace from the discussion to the implementation phase. the u.s. is also working with the russians to focus specifically on improvements in the financing and management of un operations. the purpose of these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our participation in un or csce sponsored actions. multilateral and bilateral partnership with reform finally, the administration continues to move ahead on a range of initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and political reformers throughout russia and the other states. the administration is continuing work with our g-7 partners to assemble the package of multilateral assistance that secretaries bentsen and christopher recently negotiated in tokyo. and the administration is continuing consultation with congress over the further efforts the u.s. will take to assist the process of reform in russia and the other states. * * * the administration believes these steps can increase american security while improving the relationship between the u.s. and russia, and between the

doesn't seem like those responsible for the assault were very concerned about the welfare of the children inside. seems like they were more interested in flexing their muscle before the media. my reasoning? just ask yourself this one question: suppose the scenario was slightly different and we had chelsea clinton being kidnapped by terrorists, holed up in a compound for 51 days. do you think clinton, reno, the fbi, and the atf would be so eager to use a show of force? nuff said. -- richard mulac ck347@cleveland.freenet.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort | these pontifications of free-thinking anarchist." - charles montgomery burns | are my own!

yesterday, the fbi was saying that at least three of the bodies had gunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the fire. today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies. at the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while koresh had a class iii (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the government as saying, no, they didn't have a license. today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action i would expect from a suicide. our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence and negligence. why should i believe the fbi's claims about anything else, when we can see that they are lying? this system of government is beyond reform. -- clayton e. cramer {uunet,pyramid}!optilink!cramer my opinions, all mine! relations between people to be by mutual consent, or not at all.

after the initial gun battle was over, they had 50 days to come out peacefully. they had their high priced lawyer, and judging by the posts here they had some public support. can anyone come up with a rational explanation why the didn't come out (even after they negotiated coming out after the radio sermon) that doesn't include the davidians wanting to commit suicide/murder/general mayhem? richard
