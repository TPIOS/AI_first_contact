Learn Coding before University

As science and technology rapidly develop, computers are becoming increasingly popular in many families. It is hard to imagine a family in which there is no computer in a modern city. Thus, many computer skills are required in our daily life, such as techniques in Word, Excel or PowerPoint and other skills in fixing pictures or editing movies. However, these days, one of the most important computer skills is coding. Although many students begin to study programming when they go to university, students should learn how to code before they start university.
Learning coding before university makes it easier for students to learn and have less pressure in university. According to my survey report, 32.18% of CUHK(SZ) students said that they knew nothing about programming before they came to university. However, over 60% of students confirmedly believed that if they study programming before university, the experience they learned before will help them do better in university. Only 25.29% of students said that they had experience with coding, and furthermore, 81.82% of them were learned in high school. These students are not anxious about the programming courses in Year One in university. Instead, they enjoyed the courses and had little pressure. As a result, the data showed that if one studied programming before university, he or she may do well in the programming courses and have less stress. Some people may argue that if students learn programming in high school, those kinds of courses will increase students¡¯ course load in high school. My survey reported that as long as the programming course only requires practice and does not require examination, less than 10% of students will refuse to take that course. In this way, students will not feel too much pressure and could happily study coding both in high school and university.
In addition, learning how to code will improve students¡¯ soft skills. As Resnick wrote, students are not just learning to code, they are coding to learn (Resnick, 2013). First, coding may help students learn how to think and solve a problem. Steve Jobs said that, ¡°I think everyone should learn how to program, because it teaches you how to think (Scott, 2015).¡± In all programming environments, programmers always know that they should break big problems into smaller manageable steps when they have no idea what to do. There is an algorithm called divided and conquer which shows the exactly the same idea as programmers think. Like divided and conquer, there are many algorithms which are very useful in our daily life when we want to solve a problem. If students learn those algorithms before they go to university, they may have a clear chain of thought when they face problems in university, even in the future. The earlier to train the ideas of thinking and solving problem, the better life will students live in university and in the future. Second, interacting with codes, students will improve their perseverance. When the program fails to run, students need to persevere with debugging. During debugging, students will learn how to face the mistake, and do not fear the failure. They will know that success is a scribbly line (Lawicki, 2014). Perseverance is a very important soft skill. It will keep us calm when we face a tough problem. Third, learning programming may help students improve their communication skills and team capabilities. According to my investigation, when students meet difficulties during coding, almost many may turn to their friends, ask outstanding students for help or search on the Internet. Students will learn how to clearly express the difficulties in which they are stuck and talk politely and calmly when they are asking questions. The importance of communication skills and team capabilities is so valuable in university and in the future as is known to all.
While some people and students may think that studying coding may affect future major choice and there are few trained teachers in the field of computer science in schools before university. According to my survey report, it seems true that 62.07% of students suggest that learning coding before university may affect their major choice. However, like Resnick asked the question in the front of his article ¡°Is it important for all children to learn how to write? After all, very few children grow up to become journalists, novelists, or professional writers. So why should everyone learn to write?¡± said, coding is more likely as an extension of writing (Resnick, 2013). If someone studies physics in high school, must he or she choose physics as his or her future major? The logic of learning coding before university is same as two questions mentioned before. Obama said in one of his weekly addresses that ¡°In the new economy, computer science isn¡¯t an optional skill ¡ª it¡¯s a basic skill, right along with the three ¡®R¡¯s (The Obama White House, 2016).¡± As the technology become more advanced than before, coding is becoming necessary in any work and in any fields of studies. For the second counterargument, it is quite easy to solve the problem as long as the headmaster and administrators of human resources department of a high school know the importance of coding. Therefore, one school will hire professional teachers in the field of computer science.
As more intelligence and automation are being applied in people's production and life, many people put forward higher requirements for programming. By 2020, roughly one million coding jobs will go unfilled, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Cava, 2015).  There are some projects in America trying to add Computer Science as a course both in elementary school and high school, for example, Google's 2-year-old U.S.-focused CS First program (Cava, 2015). Learning coding before university not only can separate the stress in the university but also can enhance students¡¯ soft skills such as the ability to think and solve problems, perseverance and communication skills. Although some people proposed that there are many obstacles on the way of implementing learning coding before university projects, the leadership of each country will notice the importance of computer and coding as the development of science and technology. As a result, more people will support the purpose that students should learn how to code before they attend to university.
